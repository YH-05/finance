      "transcript_text1": "Well, good morning, London, and good afternoon to Hong Kong and to Mumbai.\r\n2013 has been a challenging year for the industry and for Standard Chartered. While our clients have remained very active, the overall outcome for the group has not been as good as we would have liked. When this time last year we announced another strong set of results, we said we were not complacent and would continue to refresh our strategy to ensure the group is able to adapt to the changing environment. As we stated at the Investor Day in November, the annual strategy review confirmed that we are in markets where there remain good opportunities for profitable growth. And the new organization structure will ensure that the group is best placed to take advantage of these opportunities by supporting clients and customers in a more seamless way, providing them with access to a broad range of products and services. Now Peter is going to talk about this in more detail, but first, let me comment on the board's perspective.\r\nThe board remains intensely focused on shareholders' interests, and this was at the top of our minds last year. The business has grown substantially over the last decade, and the board continues to view Standard Chartered as an exciting growth story over the medium to long term. We remain focused on delivering profitable, sustainable growth that is within our risk appetite. The board aims to grow the amount we return to shareholders each year, and this year, we are recommending a final dividend of $0.572, resulting in a total annual dividend increase of 2%. We have increased the amount of dividend paid to our shareholders each year for well over a decade.\r\nEnsuring the business continues to focus on the returns that are generated for shareholders each year is a top priority for the board, as is maintaining our well-capitalized, highly liquid and diverse balance sheet. Since 2010, we have organically grown our balance sheet, increasing loans and advances to customers by 21%, and yet we still have the same Core Tier 1 ratio at the end of 2013 that we had at the end of 2010. Richard will go into further detail, but we are confident in our ability to achieve capital-accretive growth whilst supporting our clients and the creation of wealth across our markets.\r\nLet me at this point, though, comment briefly on how we remunerate our people, most of whom are not located in the U.K. Consistent with past practice, we reward for good performance, as well as taking into account of how our people deliver long-term sustainable and profitable business. Reflecting our performance in 2013, the bonus pool is down on the prior year by 15%. And we are returning to shareholders by way of dividends around twice as much as we are paying out in bonuses, as this slide clearly shows. Overall, our staff costs are broadly flat compared to last year. This slide also shows how much we're paying out in corporate taxes. That includes the U.K. bank levy, which has increased substantially again this year.\r\nFinally, I would like to comment briefly on the board-level changes we set out in January when we announced the reorganization of the group. Steve Bertamini will step down from the board at the end of this month after more than 5 years leading Consumer Banking. I would like to thank Steve for the very considerable contribution he has made to the business over that time and wish him every success in the future. And sadly, we'll also be saying farewell to Richard Meddings, as this is likely to be his last full year's results presentation. Richard has been on our board for 11 years, and his contribution to the business has been immense. As a colleague and as a friend, I know he will be greatly missed. I'd also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mike Rees, who many of you already know, as he takes up his new role as Deputy Group CEO next month. Mike will be available to take questions later in the meeting.\r\nSo while 2013 has been a challenging year, I believe we remain in good shape to support our clients and customers, and the opportunities for the business remain compelling. We will continue to support the growth of trade and wealth across our markets and continue to drive value for our shareholders, from our competitive strengths and from the opportunities we see in the markets we know so well.\r\nAt the same time, our focus on conduct has intensified. We expect the right behavior at all times, as being Here for good is firmly embedded in our DNA. We're therefore confident that we are well positioned to drive further value for our shareholders over the coming months.\r\nNow on that note, let me hand over to Richard.\n\n---\n\nThank you, John. Good morning, London, and good afternoon, Hong Kong and Mumbai.\r\n2013 was a challenging year both for us and for the industry, with margin and spread compression, volatile financial markets and, for us, Korea which remains difficult. We've responded to these challenges by consistently supporting our customer's growth and by managing costs and risks tightly. We have recently sharpened our strategic focus and flexed our financial framework to strike the right balance between growth, returns and managing for capital accretion.\r\nAs with our previous results, we exclude from all of our commentary, own credit adjustments, the impairment of goodwill in Korea and the 2012 settlement with the U.S. authorities. On this basis, profit before tax for the year is down $560 million or 7% to just under $7 billion, driven by a number of factors, including continued challenges in Korea where operating profit is down nearly $530 million, with Consumer Banking contributing $326 million of this fall, Peter will discuss Korea in more detail; material margin compression in Transaction Banking following a significant influx of liquidity into our markets, causing a drag to income of nearly $400 million; and as guided concerning the second half of the year, surrounding the effects of QE tapering as well as increased and, to an extent, unclear, regulation impacting Financial Markets where income fell by $564 million half-on-half, with the fourth quarter 19% lower than the third. The performance pressure in this business, which we highlighted in our pre-close, has since been reflected by other major banks in their recent trading updates. Finally, Principal Finance performed poorly, down over $200 million year-on-year.\r\nA number of these headwinds are easing as we enter 2014. And there were, of course, some very strong performances in the year, including Hong Kong but also in most countries in Africa, the MESA region and India, and also in Mortgages and in Corporate Finance. In response to the challenges, we have been extremely disciplined in managing costs, with expenses for the year only 1% higher than in 2012 at $10.2 billion. And we've achieved this despite inflationary pressure of 4% to 5% across our footprint; continuing our investment programs; absorbing a 63% increase in the underlying cost of the U.K. bank levy, now $266 million; significant increases in regulatory and compliance costs, up some $160 million on 2012; and a one-off VAT-related charge in Korea of $54 million. As we saw our income trajectory slow during the year, we managed our costs assertively.\r\nNow let me draw out several key aspects of our performance. Group income of $18.7 billion was 1% down on 2012, but with 25 markets each now contributing income of over $100 million. As I mentioned earlier, costs remained tightly controlled and were up only 1%. Reflecting a strong but lower profits performance, we have reduced the bonus pool by 15% across the group, and this impact will mainly be borne by the more senior executives. Total impairment has increased 25%. Within this, loan impairment has increased 35%, driven in the main by continued elevated impairment levels in the unsecured Consumer Banking portfolio.\r\nThe group delivered profit before tax of nearly $7 billion and normalized earnings of almost $5 billion, down 8%. Normalized return on equity was 11.2% and normalized EPS was $2.04, down 9%. Our balance sheet remains in excellent shape, highly liquid and well diversified. And finally, we remain well capitalized by any measure, both compared to our peers and looking out to 2019, but more on this later.\r\nMoving to our performance by business, and starting with Consumer Banking.\r\nConsumer Banking's performance is in line with our pre-close guidance. Income grew 2% year-on-year, although it fell 5% in the second half. This reflects slower Wealth Management income, the initial impact of derisking the unsecured book and regulatory cooling measures, which dampened Mortgage volumes. Expenses were well controlled, increasing by only 1% year-on-year, delivering positive jaws of 1%. Headcount in Consumer Banking reduced by 7%. Total impairment increased 45%, as guided. And as a result, Consumer Banking operating profit fell 11%.\r\nKorea has continued to have a material impact on the Consumer Banking performance, driven by a difficult operating environment where industry-wide returns on equity have fallen below 3%, continued elevated levels of impairment and the impact of our selective derisking of unsecured products, including the planned sale of the consumer finance businesses. As a result of these challenging conditions, Consumer Banking in Korea made an operating loss of $162 million, which is $326 million lower earnings than the prior year. If you were to exclude Korea, Consumer Banking income was actually up 5%, with profits up 8%, driven by Hong Kong, MESA, India and the Africa region.\r\nTurning to income by product.\r\nMortgage income was up 10%, reflecting 14 basis points of margin improvement and with Hong Kong a significant driver. Deposit income was down 7% year-on-year, particularly in Hong Kong, Korea, India and China, with margins down 12 basis points to 71 basis points.\r\nWealth Management income was up 2% year-on-year, although income in the second half was down by 11%. Market uncertainty impacted sentiment, particularly in equity products, representing about 1/3 of Wealth Management income and which were down 17% half-on-half. Hong Kong remained our largest market for Wealth Management, growing income 9% and, together with MESA, which grew income 11%, offset weaker performances in Singapore, Korea and other Asia Pacific.\r\nIncome in Credit Cards and Personal Loans increased 5% year-on-year and was broadly flat half-on-half. Selective growth in markets like China, the U.A.E. and Africa was offset by a continued derisking in markets like Korea where we have reduced the credit card and personal loan book by 18% year-on-year to just over $5 billion.\r\nSME income was up 3%, with lower deposit income offset by good growth across lending, FX and trade and working capital as we continue to finance the growth of our SME customers.\r\nMoving to impairment. Consumer Banking loan impairment increased by 53% or $360 million, with Korea accounting for over 40% of the increase. We have taken action in Korea by tightening underwriting standards, changing customer acquisition strategies and exiting customer segments more prone to filing under the Personal Debt Rehabilitation Scheme. Outside of Korea, loan impairment increased by 47% year-on-year, reflecting previous asset growth and the seasoning of the unsecured portfolio, plus some $53 million of lower debt sales. As previously guided, we have taken steps to derisk our unsecured book across the group. Given the slower growth in unsecured assets going forward, we would expect loan impairment from seasoning to moderate in the second half of this year.\r\nLooking now at Wholesale Banking.\r\nWholesale Banking income is down 2%, which is slightly lower than our expectation at the time of the pre-close, arising from delayed deal execution in Principal Finance as well as continuing weak financial markets conditions. Within this, client income, which represents 86% of Wholesale Banking, was up 4%, and own account income was down 25%.\r\nThe operating environment was impacted by a number of factors during the year. Most of these factors were either temporary or cyclical, including the high levels of liquidity in our markets, the persistently low interest rate environment, uncertainty over the pace and timing of QE tapering and indiscriminate deterioration in sentiment on emerging markets in the second half. Other factors like regulatory change impacting derivative markets were more structural in nature.\r\nExpenses were very tightly controlled, increasing only 1% year-on-year, with lower staff costs offsetting increased regulatory expenses. Furthermore, expenses were down 2% in the second half with reduced variable compensation as business performance fell, as well as tight control over hiring and BAU costs.\r\nTotal impairment rose 5% year-on-year. And within this, loan impairment was up 12%, representing 39 basis points of Wholesale Banking customer loans and advances. Other impairment was down 19%. As a result, profit before tax for Wholesale Banking is down 4%.\r\nLooking at income in more detail by product.\r\nWithin Transaction Banking, Trade income was down 4% and cash and custody income was down 5%, driven by margin compression of 27 basis points or 19% in Trade and 15 basis points or 16% in cash. We saw strong growth in both average trade balances, up 21%, and cash, up 11%. Importantly, margins are showing signs of stabilization, albeit at levels still lower than that of the first half of last year.\r\nCorporate Finance continued to perform strongly, with income up 13% on 2012. As highlighted in the pre-close, despite some delay in deal execution in the second half, income growth remains broad based, with around 70% annuity in nature and with a strong pipeline as we entered 2014.\r\nALM income was down 10% year-on-year and down 16% half-on-half, reflecting fewer derisking opportunities in the second half and the continued low interest rate environment. Weak equity markets resulted in lower revaluation gains in our Principal Finance investments, and income was down 43%. Although we saw challenging market conditions in 2013, the comparator for 2014 has eased.\r\nLooking at Financial Markets in a little more detail on the next slide. Income in Financial Markets was flat year-on-year at $3.65 billion, as strong volume growth was offset by spread compression. Within this, client income was up 7% and own account income down 25%. Market conditions deteriorated in the second half, as I mentioned earlier, and as a result, Financial Markets income overall was down 27% on the first half. Rising yields on emerging market bonds and directional uncertainty in the markets led to lower own account income. This impacted our Rates business in particular where income dropped by 1/3 compared to a strong first half. Negative emerging market sentiment also impacted income from our financial institution clients, although income from corporates remained robust, albeit in line with usual seasonal trends.\r\nOur foreign exchange business performed well, with income up 11%, driven by cash FX and FX options, supported by our continued strength in offshore renminbi. Cash FX volumes were up 21%, offsetting spread compression of 12%. And in Rates, volumes were also up 20%. Our equities business made reasonable progress, partially offsetting lower commodities income.\r\nMoving to impairment. Total impairment in Wholesale Banking was up 5% year-on-year, driven by a small number of exposures in India and Africa. These exposures drove an increase in gross nonperforming loans, up by some $900 million or 22% on 2012. This represents just over 2% of Wholesale Banking loans and advances, consistent with the levels seen in recent years. The cover ratio, given these exposures, has declined slightly to 48%, but this increases to 60% after including collateral at a forced sale value. The net at risk remains well within our observed historic recovery rates. We are also seeing signs of improving potential recovery levels and, in particular, against a number of nonperforming loans in our MESA region.\r\nThe portfolio continues to perform well, and early alerts are stable. We are not seeing any new areas of stress, but we remain watchful in India and also on the potential impact of lower commodity prices more generally.\r\nTurning to the management of risk and the shape of our portfolio. Let me just repeat some of the characteristics of our balance sheet that perhaps get taken for granted but are material points of differentiation from our peers. In Consumer Banking, the book has a continuing bias towards secured lending, with 82% of the book being either fully or partially secured at an average loan-to-value on our Mortgage book of 48%. We continued to derisk the Consumer unsecured portfolio, with Credit Cards and Personal Loans balances down 6% year-on-year. Consumer Banking 30- and 90-day delinquency rates are stable, as are Wholesale Banking early alerts.  As in earlier periods, a significant majority of \"past due but not impaired\" balances as of the balance sheet date were cured in the following month.\r\nOur portfolios are very diverse. Energy, our largest Wholesale Banking industry concentration, is around 20% of corporate exposures and, as we've shown you before, is in itself highly diversified. We maintain a short-dated Wholesale Banking book, with 64% of the book maturing in under 1 year, reflecting our Trade bias. Trade assets have the lowest propensity to loss of any Wholesale Banking asset category, with an empirical default rate of around 2 basis points.\r\nWholesale Banking is highly collateralized, with $197 billion in gross total collateral which is held at conservative forced sale values. Stick positions are down by 26% to $1.5 billion, representing less than 1% of Wholesale Banking loans and advances to customers. And finally, we continue to distribute assets successfully, with primary distribution in the year up 9% and loan sales up 29%. The portfolio is therefore diverse, short tenor, highly collateralized and showing no material signs of stress.\r\nMoving to the group's balance sheet.\r\nLiabilities. Our strong and disciplined management of the balance sheet provides us resilience and allows us to take advantages of opportunities for growth. Looking at liquidity: The balance sheet remains highly liquid with an AD ratio of 76%. 52% of customer deposits are in current and savings accounts. We have a liquid asset ratio of 30%, with over $200 billion of the balance sheet in cash or near cash. We remain a strong provider of net interbank liquidity. And we continue to exceed by a substantial degree the Basel III net stable funding ratio and the liquidity coverage ratio, and some years ahead of the required implementation dates.\r\nTurning to assets. Our loan book remains well diversified by geography, industry, counterparty and product. Loans and advances to customers were up 4%, as we continued to support our clients and customers. Risk-weighted assets grew 7%, driven in the main by asset growth, regulatory consolidation of Permata Bank and credit migration. As you can see, Wholesale Banking represents 75% of group risk-weighted assets and grew at 9%, whilst Consumer Banking remained flat.\r\nNow given the recent market focus, I would like to spend some time setting out the strength of our capital position.  \r\nLet me deal with Basel II first. The group's Core Tier 1 ratio was 11.8% at the end of 2013, the same as it was in 2010 and up some 40 basis points since the half year, the product of risk-weighted asset discipline and the phasing of operational risk, risk-weighted assets and dividend payments. Tier 1 was 13.1%, and total capital, 18%. In addition, we currently estimate our PLAC or primary loss absorbing capacity at 23%, again very robust compared to our peers'. Since our 2010 rights issue, we have very evidently self-funded balance sheet growth and the continued payment of a growing dividend. Our Core Tier 1 ratio has remained at 11.8% whilst growing risk-weighted assets by $77 billion at a CAGR of 10% and declared over $5.5 billion in dividends.\r\nTurning to Basel III. On 1st of January 2014, our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio is 10.9% on a transitional basis and rises to 11.2% on an endpoint basis. And it's not just our core equity Tier 1 that's strong. For total capital, we are again strong in absolute terms and relative to our peers. We've been active issuers of Tier 2 capital during 2013, with total capital reaching 18%. These issuances showed strong appetite for our credit and an ability to issue across markets and currencies.\r\nSo we are well capitalized today in absolute and relative terms on all metrics, including core equity Tier 1, total capital and PLAC. In addition, our leverage ratio stands at a very strong 4.7% at the year end.\r\nWe believe it will be helpful for more capital guidance to be given to the market, in particular around the interplay of the various capital buffers and, most importantly, the minimum capital levels for each individual institution. To help clarify, this slide sets out how we see Standard Chartered's capital position against minimum known requirements, which informs the guidance we have received from the PRA.\r\nWe begin with a 4.5% minimum core equity Tier 1 requirement common to all banks, a 2.5% capital conservation buffer common to all banks. It is primarily against this buffer that the Pillar 2B or PRA buffer will be assessed and where we are conservatively positioned. A 1% GSIB buffer applicable to Standard Chartered. And a 0.4% Pillar 2A core equity Tier 1 requirement, which is subject to annual review by the PRA. This totals to a known capital stack of 8.4% core equity Tier 1 capital ratio for Standard Chartered, and let's call this our capital stack.\r\nAt 10.9% core equity Tier 1, we are already significantly and materially above our capital stack, and by some 250 basis points. We are therefore substantially above the known threshold, with capacity for additional buffers. We are also today already significantly and materially ahead of the target ratios the PRA has guided us to achieve and by 2019.\r\nOn this next slide, let's look at the broader industry. It is crucial to understand that capital requirements will differ for each bank. This is the new regulatory model. The PRA's Pillar 2A guidance is different. GSIB buffers are different. Countercyclical buffers and sectoral capital requirements will be different to reflect each bank's unique business model and risk profile. Capital requirements are not uniform, nor should they be. As recent peer results demonstrate, there are variances in the end-state capital levels, with targets ranging from above 10% to 12% or above. When you think about a bank's capital strength, it is not how high the current ratios are or what the target capital ratios are. It is by how much they are above their own capital stack. Let me give you 2 examples.\r\nFirst, the GSIB capital requirements range from 0 to 2.5%, according to the different systemic risk profiles of each institution. The GSIB requirement for us at 1% is between 1% and 1.5% lower than that of other U.K.-based international banks. We were also included in the 1% category not because the calculation methodology required it but through a supervisory override. This is therefore conservative. Second, Pillar 2A guidance naturally varies from bank to bank, as it reflects the PRA's intention to capture idiosyncratic risks not included in Pillar 1. These include pension, interest rate, credit concentration and operational risks. You will note from other disclosures that this Pillar 2A buffer can be very different between banks. Our current core equity Tier 1 Pillar 2A guidance of some 40 basis points is demonstrably less than a number of our U.K. peers simply because we do not carry any material U.K. pension risk.\r\nTo summarize. Our known minimum is 8.4%. The minimum requirement for other banks is very different given they're often higher GSIB or other requirements or a Pillar 2A guidance. Our current buffer above the capital stack of some 250 basis points is clearly very strong compared to peers and positions us very well to manage future regulatory capital demands as they evolve. The laws governing the countercyclical or systemic risk buffers are not yet finalized, but when we stand back and we compare the diversity of our balance sheet and our risk profile against the 250 basis point buffer, we believe we are very strongly positioned with our current capital to absorb any capital add-on that we can see today whilst continuing to support the growth of our clients and customers.\r\nNext slide. Now despite this, the U.K. regulatory sentiment towards capital levels is clear. And there will be further model adjustments, which we currently estimate could be in the range of 30 to 50 basis points for us in 2014. And it is against this backdrop that we introduced the fifth metric to our financial framework: a commitment to gradually accrete capital over time. Whilst we expect risk-weighted assets to be up in 2014 with the introduction of Basel III and expected model changes, we intend to mitigate this by driving capital-accretive profitable growth through the fifth metric; by more assertive tail management of our existing portfolio; and by divesting certain risk-weighted assets, intensive assets and non-core businesses. The combined impact of these latter non-core disposals is expected to be some 10 to 15 basis points benefit to core equity Tier 1 in 2014. Since our Investor Day last November, we have already released $3 billion of risk-weighted assets from low-returning client relationships in Wholesale Banking, which we will look to redeploy into high-returning relationships. As we look into 2014, we have identified over $10 billion in further reductions, over 1/2 of which will be achieved in the first half.\r\nFinally and although we currently have no immediate issuance plans, the regulations now clearly strongly incentivize banks to hold up to 1.5% of risk-weighted assets as additional Tier 1 rather than common equity Tier 1. Given this, we will seek the necessary regulatory and shareholder approvals to enable us to issue these instruments in the future. Now I've spent some time on this, but hopefully, it gives you a much clearer picture of the strength of our capital position both of itself and relative to peers.\r\nSo let me conclude, and turning first to outlook. Our outlook for 2014 is, as you know, one of modest growth. Market and trading conditions are more volatile and difficult than a year ago. Whilst current performance momentum is ahead of the second half of last year, performance in this first half will remain challenged both at an income and at a profit level.\r\nAnd finally, as this is my last Full Year Results Presentation for Standard Chartered, if you will allow me just to reflect on aspects of the bank of which I am very proud. This is a bank underpinned by excellent foundations, a hugely robust balance sheet, well capitalized, highly liquid, diverse in both assets and liabilities and disciplined by a financial framework that balances growth and returns. We serve customers and clients in the growth markets of the world and have, since the financial crisis, almost doubled our lending to our customers, increasing that lending by some $190 billion doing what a bank should do. And this is an organization full of really great people.\r\nAnd I also wanted just to take the opportunity to thank you, our investors and analysts both in the room or listening via the webcast or dial-in. For the past 11 years on the board, 7 as Finance Director, and through quite remarkable period of utter change for the industry, I have really appreciated your support both personally and for the bank. I've valued our relationship and tried to answer all of your questions. I've usually enjoyed the conversations we've had. And I've also learned a great deal from all of you. So thank you.\r\nAnd let me now hand over to Peter.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Richard. Good morning, London, and good afternoon to those of you in Hong Kong and Mumbai.\r\nAs you've heard, 2013 was a tough year. We faced margin pressures in a number of key businesses and markets. Regulatory requirements and the bank levy put upward pressure on costs. Various factors drove a sharp increase in unsecured loan impairment. And much more negative sentiment towards emerging markets affected valuations and transaction closing in Wholesale Banking. And we took goodwill impairment on our business in Korea given the severity of the challenges facing us and the industry as a whole in that market. And as a result, we slipped from our trajectory of record income and profits, posting lower income and profits for the first time in over a decade. And our share price fell, reflecting both our own performance and investor sentiment towards our markets.\r\n \r\nThis is not what we aspire to achieve. So as we saw the challenges mount and our momentum slow, we took action to mitigate the impact and to adapt to the changing environment. Some of the things we've done are unashamedly tactical, putting even tighter controls on spend and headcount, derisking certain portfolios, but the more fundamental changes relate to our strategy and how we are organizing ourselves and deploying our resources to deliver the sustainable, profitable growth and returns that drive shareholder value. That's what I want to focus on today.\r\nBut first, let me tell you how we're looking at the world. I don't need to tell you that investor sentiment towards emerging markets turned sharply from May last year and remains quite negative and jumpy. At least as far as our markets are concerned, we think this is a quite short-term, perhaps somewhat overblown, phenomenon. The longer-term attractions of Asia, Africa and the Middle East remain compelling. In fact, we expect our markets to do better in GDP growth terms in 2014 than they did in 2013, with aggregate growth rising from 2.8% to 3.5%. And the underlying drivers of economic growth across the emerging world, demographics, urbanization, rapid growth in the consuming middle class, investment in infrastructure, remain very strong. By 2030, Asia alone will add just over 2.2 billion people to the consuming middle class, taking its share of the global total to about 66%, 2/3. And when I talk to our clients, it's clear that there is some disconnect between the dynamics of global financial markets and the drivers of the real economy. Our clients see much, if not most, of their growth coming from the emerging world and particularly from Asia. They see a robust recovery in the U.S. and even a weak recovery in Europe as huge positives for Asia, Africa and the Middle East.\r\nOf course, there are economic and political risks. Some of our markets face difficult political and social transitions that could have a significant impact on business confidence. India and Indonesia face important elections this year, which will determine the pace of future reforms and GDP growth. Reshaping China's economy will create stresses, the tensions in the South China Sea pose risks. And while we're not directly exposed, we're obviously watching events in Ukraine very carefully, alert to potential lock-ons. So while it may make perfect sense for investors to rebalance their portfolios to capture the rebound in the West, the resulting negative impact on emerging market indices and valuations risks disguising the fundamental attractiveness of these markets.\r\nIn addition to the issues specific to our markets, we face some broader challenges. One is the ongoing torrent of regulatory change. The Basel III agenda is nearing completion, which is a considerable achievement and one we welcome, but this risks being undermined by a profusion of unilateral initiatives and interpretations. What the global economy needs now is consistency and stability in the international financial framework.\r\nA second big challenge, which affects the entire industry, is to rebuild trust and credibility. Put bluntly, society expects more of us. We must raise the bar on conduct so that every employee looks to comply with the spirit, not just the letter of the laws and regulations, in everything they do. In 2013, we launched a multipronged program to address this challenge. We have substantially increased resources devoted to conduct issues. We've invested in systems to enhance our controls and reduce the risk of manual errors. We've relaunched our code of conduct, requiring every member of staff to complete mandatory in-depth training and personally commit to the code. We've sharpened the way we link performance assessment and reward to personal values and behaviors. We recognize that we haven't got everything right in the past and that we've got a lot of work to do in this arena, but we are determined to raise the bar to make doing the right thing a front-of-mind imperative for everyone in the bank. That's what Here for good is all about.\r\nThe third challenge is technology. As a fundamentally digitizable industry, every aspect of banking can be transformed by technology, yet this is as much an opportunity as a threat. Through technology-driven innovation, we can empower our clients, cut costs, improve risk management, reinvent every aspect of the business. The trick is to make it happen rather than to have it happen to us. At our annual strategy board last June, we took stock of the strategy, asking tough questions about the growth potential in our markets, our ability to win market share, the impact of the more challenging regulatory and market environment. Since capital and investment spend are going to be even scarcer resources, we wanted to sharpen our focus, get really clear on what we should be investing in, where we should cut back. Our answer, which we set out for you in November, was go to the core of what we are all about. We bank the people and companies driving investment, trade and the creation of wealth across Asia, Africa and the Middle East. That's the essence of who we are. We're not trying to bank everybody, but we do want to bank those that are making things happen. We're focused on investment, trade and wealth. We're sticking to the markets we know so well: Asia, Africa and the Middle East.\r\nFrom this core statement, we distilled, first, a set of 5 strategic aspirations that flesh out how we will grow the core, and I'll put a bit more color on some of these in a moment; second, a set of 5 tests we're applying to more peripheral businesses to ensure we reinforce the core, I'll show you how we're using these; third, a significant reorganization of our regions, business and functions to ensure alignment to the strategy and to streamline the way we work; fourth, our flexed financial framework, which now has 5 metrics, including both positive jaws and capital accretion, we'll use this to explain our performance and ensure we're balancing the imperatives of near-term delivery against longer-term strategic progress; and finally, our, as it happens, 5 priorities for 2014, these are used to set personal and team objectives across the bank, ensuring that everybody is marching to the same tune.\r\nSo what you have here is an overarching framework that links strategy to performance and to the way we run the bank and to our immediate priorities. Let me expand a little on each of the elements.\r\nIn November, we set out these 5 strategic aspirations that crystallize what we want to achieve in growing the business. Our strategy revolves around relationships, not products, not transactions. We've shown you before the success we've had in deepening relationships with our biggest clients, yet we think we have scope to do much more, particularly by focusing on the next 500 clients. And we could do better in building similarly deep relationships with our smaller corporate, Private Banking and retail clients. This is one of the key reasons why we are reorganizing the business, combining Wholesale and Consumer Banking to create 3 client segment groups and 5 product groups under Mike Rees, who is sitting up here today and will join us in answering questions.\r\nFor example, by creating the commercial client segment, we'll make it much easier to focus on the needs of mid-sized corporate clients. Such middle-sized companies are a huge part of the economies in which we operate, up to 60%, and represent a rapidly growing component of the banking revenue pool, yet up to now, we have failed to make the most of this opportunity. We've fragmented our efforts between Wholesale and Consumer Banking and generate less than 10% of our total income from this important client segment. Now we will take a much more integrated approach. Through targeting high-growth and exporting industries and being more efficient in onboarding, we'll grow the client base by leveraging our network and full product capability. We'll make ourselves more relevant and deepen relationships. And when these clients get bigger, we'll transition them up to our Corporate and Institutional client segment, much easier now that we are organized as one global business.\r\nAlso, grouping our commercial clients with our Private Banking business will massively facilitate cross-referral. The new commercial segment will start with about 50,000-or-so clients, mainly entrepreneurial family-owned groups that are the perfect target market for Private Banking. Yet up to now, a very small proportion have become Private Banking clients an obvious opportunity. Indeed, the scale of the Private Banking opportunity across our markets is enormous. Today, there is some $10 trillion of assets under management, AUM, from high-net-worth individuals in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. By 2017, this number should more than double.\r\nAnd we start with a very good platform with $58 billion in AUM, good product capabilities, experienced relationship managers and a network of advisory and booking centers, but we can scale up and enhance our offer, leveraging our client franchise and network more effectively. A great example is the Africa-to-London corridor, which we are superbly positioned to serve given our extensive African footprint and London advisory and booking center.\r\nBut the greater emphasis we're putting on Private Banking is just one element of the way we are stepping up our efforts in the Wealth Management arena. Given the pace of individual wealth accumulation across our markets and the relatively early stage in the development of these markets, there's a huge opportunity to provide our retail and Private Banking clients with Wealth Management products and services. This is already a substantial business for us, generating income of $1.3 billion in 2013, but this is only the beginning. Our aspiration is to more than double assets under management by 2020 to $300 billion. That's why we're elevating Wealth Management from being a product group within Consumer Banking to sit alongside our well-established Wholesale Banking product groups in the new structure, like Corporate Finance, Transaction Banking and Financial Markets, which are already all much bigger.\r\nTurning to trade and payments. This is at the heart of what Standard Chartered is all about. We are already a top 2 trade bank by SWIFT data. Our goal is to be #1. We continue to win market share, with average trade assets up by 21% in 2013 against market growth of around 6%. Of course, Trade income was affected by the sharp fall in margins, but we are clearly well placed to benefit as margins stabilize. And we're taking advantage of the shift towards companies using the renminbi for trade and payments.\r\nFrom virtually nothing in 2009, some 16% of China's trade, just over $730 billion, is now settled in renminbi. By 2020, we think this will more than quadruple to over $3 trillion. To give a sense of the pace at which the renminbi is being internationalized: The Standard Chartered Renminbi Globalization Index, which measures all aspects of offshore renminbi activity, went up 84% in 2013, whilst our own international renminbi payment flows were up 122%. And new things are happening all the time. In December, we launched renminbi clearing in London via a joint venture with Agricultural Bank of China. Last month, we executed the first renminbi cross-border sweeping transaction for a company based in the new Shanghai free-trade zone.\r\nTo create the capacity to achieve our strategic aspirations, we need to sharpen our focus. We've therefore been systematically subjecting those businesses that are underperforming or less aligned to our core strategy to 5 tests, asking tough questions about their strategic relevance, alignment with Here for good and sustainable economics. As a result, we are exiting or reconfiguring a number of smaller businesses. And just as important is being more selective about our client relationships. We're exiting or reshaping relationships, both big and small, which offer no prospect of attractive returns, making clear to our clients that, to be sustainable, our relationships have to be economically attractive for both sides. And this has made for some tough conversations. We're also continuing to take action on our most underperforming or problematic businesses, above all, Korea.\r\nAs Richard said, our business in Korea had an extremely challenging 2013, with profits down, before the goodwill impairment, $527 million to a loss of $13 million. Much of this was due to a sharp fall in Consumer Banking performance given elevated levels of impairment, up 66%, and income falling by 12%, partly as a result of selective derisking of the unsecured book and the charge we've taken on the prospective sale of 2 small subsidiaries. Weak underlying trading performance was exacerbated by a one-off tax-related charge of $54 million and the non-repeat of last year's property sales which had contributed income of $74 million. Against this, one positive factor was the continued strength of our network income relating to Korean clients, a significant and growing revenue stream of over $200 million.\r\nOf course, we weren't alone in encountering difficulties in Korea. 6 of the 7 major banks saw income and profits fall by double-digit rates, and average ROE was below 3%, the lowest for a decade. As the sixth largest player in the industry, we can't entirely escape the dynamics of the industry, yet neither can we tolerate such underperformance since it creates such a drag on the performance of the bank as a whole, so we are continuing to take action on multiple fronts. There's no silver bullet, but we're shrinking the businesses while very selectively investing to support the areas of most opportunity.  In 2013, we reduced risk-weighted assets in Korea by 7%. In 2014, we will reduce it further.\r\nWe're simplifying the structure selling off more consumer finance and savings bank subsidiaries, and we'll reduce the number of legal entities from 9 to 3. We're reducing costs as fast as we can given the constraints, with staff numbers down by nearly 400 year-on-year. We're consolidating the branch network, down by 24 during 2013, as we increasingly interact with our clients through digital means. We're redeploying capital in Wholesale Banking from locally oriented clients towards clients that can benefit from our network. And we're selectively derisking the unsecured book in Consumer Banking and putting greater emphasis on Wealth Management. As a result of these actions, our business in Korea will be smaller, more profitable, more focused on where we can play to our strengths, but given the constrained context, we cannot achieve this transformation as swiftly as we would like. Korea will continue to be very challenging through 2014.\r\nIn November, we showed you what we described as our flexed financial framework, setting out the metrics we would aspire to deliver over the next couple of years. As we've said before, these are aspirations. And we don't expect that we will always be able to deliver against all of them, we clearly haven't in the past, but they give you a sense of what it is we're setting out to achieve. We said we did not expect to deliver double-digit income growth over the next couple of years given various pressures, not least Korea. However, we haven't abandoned double-digit growth as a longer-term aspiration. Given the scale of the opportunities in our markets, we believe this remains a stretching but realistic aspiration. Of course, we're not going to compromise our risk appetite or strategic discipline to chase growth. If market circumstances only support somewhat slower growth, that's what we will deliver.\r\nTo protect the earnings momentum in an environment of slower income growth, we're shifting from a stance of broadly neutral cost-income jaws towards aiming to deliver positive jaws, i.e. costs growing more slowing than income. This will be challenging given inflationary and regulatory pressures, the bank levy and the measures we're trying -- we're taking to constrain RWA growth. And we must also keep creating the capacity to keep investing for growth. This means we must generate several hundred millions of dollars of productivity benefits every year. We did this in 2013 and we intend to keep doing it. Delivering positive jaws should help us towards our aspirations for earnings per share growth even at sub-double-digit rates of income growth. This in turn will help us continue to improve returns on equity. We already deliver returns above our cost of capital, and we'll continue to look to improve returns whilst also paying out a good level of dividends, as we have consistently done.\r\nIn November, we also introduced our fifth metric of growing profits after tax faster than RWA. As Richard has said, we have broadly funded our RWA growth through retained earnings and we are in a strong position in terms of capital ratios, yet given the ongoing uncertainty about regulatory expectations, we think it makes sense to manage for a positive capital trajectory to give us greater flexibility and resilience.\r\nSo what are our priorities for 2014? They flow very naturally from our strategic aspirations and financial framework. First, to deliver profitable and capital-accretive growth. After a disappointing performance in 2013, we are determined to get back to delivering the kind of results you expect from us. This won't happen automatically or overnight. Given the weakness of our Q4 performance, we anticipate that the first half of 2014 will prove challenging, but we are confident that the actions we are taking will give us the platform to deliver sustained and profitable growth.\r\nSecond, to make tangible progress on our 5 strategic aspirations. Here is where the reorganization will make a difference because it will enable us to put a sharper focus on the key strategic priorities, optimizing the deployment of capital and investment spend.\r\nThird, to innovate, digitize and simplify to improve productivity and effectiveness. For us to simultaneously deliver positive jaws and keep investing for growth, we have to be delivering significant productivity improvements every year, and that requires constant innovation, a bias towards digitizing everything we can and a relentless focus on simplifying and streamlining the way we work. Here again, the reorganization will help. We can strip out some duplications and drive greater standardization.\r\nFourth, to raise the bar on conduct, demonstrating that we are Here for good. This is a strategic imperative.\r\nAnd finally, to accelerate the next generation of leaders. The reorganization gives us a real opportunity to do this.\r\n2013 was not a great year for the bank. 2014 will inevitably bring its own challenges, but we are very clear on what we have to do. We're making changes to adapt to the new realities. We have a strong balance sheet and we have great client relationships and superb capabilities.\r\nI'd like to take this opportunity to thank all our staff for their hard work, commitment and professionalism during 2013. I'd particularly like to thank Richard for all he has done in his 11 years as a director, including 7 by my side as Finance Director. And I'd like to thank Steve for his leadership in transforming our Consumer Banking business over the last 5 years. And finally, I'd like to thank you, our analysts and investors, for your support through these turbulent times.\r\nI guess, well, Ben and Julian will now take any questions in Hong Kong. Sunil and Anurag will do the same in Mumbai. John, Richard, Mike and I will take your questions in London. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: John Peace (Executives)】\nWell, good morning, London, and good afternoon to Hong Kong and to Mumbai.\r\n2013 has been a challenging year for the industry and for Standard Chartered. While our clients have remained very active, the overall outcome for the group has not been as good as we would have liked. When this time last year we announced another strong set of results, we said we were not complacent and would continue to refresh our strategy to ensure the group is able to adapt to the changing environment. As we stated at the Investor Day in November, the annual strategy review confirmed that we are in markets where there remain good opportunities for profitable growth. And the new organization structure will ensure that the group is best placed to take advantage of these opportunities by supporting clients and customers in a more seamless way, providing them with access to a broad range of products and services. Now Peter is going to talk about this in more detail, but first, let me comment on the board's perspective.\r\nThe board remains intensely focused on shareholders' interests, and this was at the top of our minds last year. The business has grown substantially over the last decade, and the board continues to view Standard Chartered as an exciting growth story over the medium to long term. We remain focused on delivering profitable, sustainable growth that is within our risk appetite. The board aims to grow the amount we return to shareholders each year, and this year, we are recommending a final dividend of $0.572, resulting in a total annual dividend increase of 2%. We have increased the amount of dividend paid to our shareholders each year for well over a decade.\r\nEnsuring the business continues to focus on the returns that are generated for shareholders each year is a top priority for the board, as is maintaining our well-capitalized, highly liquid and diverse balance sheet. Since 2010, we have organically grown our balance sheet, increasing loans and advances to customers by 21%, and yet we still have the same Core Tier 1 ratio at the end of 2013 that we had at the end of 2010. Richard will go into further detail, but we are confident in our ability to achieve capital-accretive growth whilst supporting our clients and the creation of wealth across our markets.\r\nLet me at this point, though, comment briefly on how we remunerate our people, most of whom are not located in the U.K. Consistent with past practice, we reward for good performance, as well as taking into account of how our people deliver long-term sustainable and profitable business. Reflecting our performance in 2013, the bonus pool is down on the prior year by 15%. And we are returning to shareholders by way of dividends around twice as much as we are paying out in bonuses, as this slide clearly shows. Overall, our staff costs are broadly flat compared to last year. This slide also shows how much we're paying out in corporate taxes. That includes the U.K. bank levy, which has increased substantially again this year.\r\nFinally, I would like to comment briefly on the board-level changes we set out in January when we announced the reorganization of the group. Steve Bertamini will step down from the board at the end of this month after more than 5 years leading Consumer Banking. I would like to thank Steve for the very considerable contribution he has made to the business over that time and wish him every success in the future. And sadly, we'll also be saying farewell to Richard Meddings, as this is likely to be his last full year's results presentation. Richard has been on our board for 11 years, and his contribution to the business has been immense. As a colleague and as a friend, I know he will be greatly missed. I'd also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mike Rees, who many of you already know, as he takes up his new role as Deputy Group CEO next month. Mike will be available to take questions later in the meeting.\r\nSo while 2013 has been a challenging year, I believe we remain in good shape to support our clients and customers, and the opportunities for the business remain compelling. We will continue to support the growth of trade and wealth across our markets and continue to drive value for our shareholders, from our competitive strengths and from the opportunities we see in the markets we know so well.\r\nAt the same time, our focus on conduct has intensified. We expect the right behavior at all times, as being Here for good is firmly embedded in our DNA. We're therefore confident that we are well positioned to drive further value for our shareholders over the coming months.\r\nNow on that note, let me hand over to Richard.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Richard Meddings (Executives)】\nThank you, John. Good morning, London, and good afternoon, Hong Kong and Mumbai.\r\n2013 was a challenging year both for us and for the industry, with margin and spread compression, volatile financial markets and, for us, Korea which remains difficult. We've responded to these challenges by consistently supporting our customer's growth and by managing costs and risks tightly. We have recently sharpened our strategic focus and flexed our financial framework to strike the right balance between growth, returns and managing for capital accretion.\r\nAs with our previous results, we exclude from all of our commentary, own credit adjustments, the impairment of goodwill in Korea and the 2012 settlement with the U.S. authorities. On this basis, profit before tax for the year is down $560 million or 7% to just under $7 billion, driven by a number of factors, including continued challenges in Korea where operating profit is down nearly $530 million, with Consumer Banking contributing $326 million of this fall, Peter will discuss Korea in more detail; material margin compression in Transaction Banking following a significant influx of liquidity into our markets, causing a drag to income of nearly $400 million; and as guided concerning the second half of the year, surrounding the effects of QE tapering as well as increased and, to an extent, unclear, regulation impacting Financial Markets where income fell by $564 million half-on-half, with the fourth quarter 19% lower than the third. The performance pressure in this business, which we highlighted in our pre-close, has since been reflected by other major banks in their recent trading updates. Finally, Principal Finance performed poorly, down over $200 million year-on-year.\r\nA number of these headwinds are easing as we enter 2014. And there were, of course, some very strong performances in the year, including Hong Kong but also in most countries in Africa, the MESA region and India, and also in Mortgages and in Corporate Finance. In response to the challenges, we have been extremely disciplined in managing costs, with expenses for the year only 1% higher than in 2012 at $10.2 billion. And we've achieved this despite inflationary pressure of 4% to 5% across our footprint; continuing our investment programs; absorbing a 63% increase in the underlying cost of the U.K. bank levy, now $266 million; significant increases in regulatory and compliance costs, up some $160 million on 2012; and a one-off VAT-related charge in Korea of $54 million. As we saw our income trajectory slow during the year, we managed our costs assertively.\r\nNow let me draw out several key aspects of our performance. Group income of $18.7 billion was 1% down on 2012, but with 25 markets each now contributing income of over $100 million. As I mentioned earlier, costs remained tightly controlled and were up only 1%. Reflecting a strong but lower profits performance, we have reduced the bonus pool by 15% across the group, and this impact will mainly be borne by the more senior executives. Total impairment has increased 25%. Within this, loan impairment has increased 35%, driven in the main by continued elevated impairment levels in the unsecured Consumer Banking portfolio.\r\nThe group delivered profit before tax of nearly $7 billion and normalized earnings of almost $5 billion, down 8%. Normalized return on equity was 11.2% and normalized EPS was $2.04, down 9%. Our balance sheet remains in excellent shape, highly liquid and well diversified. And finally, we remain well capitalized by any measure, both compared to our peers and looking out to 2019, but more on this later.\r\nMoving to our performance by business, and starting with Consumer Banking.\r\nConsumer Banking's performance is in line with our pre-close guidance. Income grew 2% year-on-year, although it fell 5% in the second half. This reflects slower Wealth Management income, the initial impact of derisking the unsecured book and regulatory cooling measures, which dampened Mortgage volumes. Expenses were well controlled, increasing by only 1% year-on-year, delivering positive jaws of 1%. Headcount in Consumer Banking reduced by 7%. Total impairment increased 45%, as guided. And as a result, Consumer Banking operating profit fell 11%.\r\nKorea has continued to have a material impact on the Consumer Banking performance, driven by a difficult operating environment where industry-wide returns on equity have fallen below 3%, continued elevated levels of impairment and the impact of our selective derisking of unsecured products, including the planned sale of the consumer finance businesses. As a result of these challenging conditions, Consumer Banking in Korea made an operating loss of $162 million, which is $326 million lower earnings than the prior year. If you were to exclude Korea, Consumer Banking income was actually up 5%, with profits up 8%, driven by Hong Kong, MESA, India and the Africa region.\r\nTurning to income by product.\r\nMortgage income was up 10%, reflecting 14 basis points of margin improvement and with Hong Kong a significant driver. Deposit income was down 7% year-on-year, particularly in Hong Kong, Korea, India and China, with margins down 12 basis points to 71 basis points.\r\nWealth Management income was up 2% year-on-year, although income in the second half was down by 11%. Market uncertainty impacted sentiment, particularly in equity products, representing about 1/3 of Wealth Management income and which were down 17% half-on-half. Hong Kong remained our largest market for Wealth Management, growing income 9% and, together with MESA, which grew income 11%, offset weaker performances in Singapore, Korea and other Asia Pacific.\r\nIncome in Credit Cards and Personal Loans increased 5% year-on-year and was broadly flat half-on-half. Selective growth in markets like China, the U.A.E. and Africa was offset by a continued derisking in markets like Korea where we have reduced the credit card and personal loan book by 18% year-on-year to just over $5 billion.\r\nSME income was up 3%, with lower deposit income offset by good growth across lending, FX and trade and working capital as we continue to finance the growth of our SME customers.\r\nMoving to impairment. Consumer Banking loan impairment increased by 53% or $360 million, with Korea accounting for over 40% of the increase. We have taken action in Korea by tightening underwriting standards, changing customer acquisition strategies and exiting customer segments more prone to filing under the Personal Debt Rehabilitation Scheme. Outside of Korea, loan impairment increased by 47% year-on-year, reflecting previous asset growth and the seasoning of the unsecured portfolio, plus some $53 million of lower debt sales. As previously guided, we have taken steps to derisk our unsecured book across the group. Given the slower growth in unsecured assets going forward, we would expect loan impairment from seasoning to moderate in the second half of this year.\r\nLooking now at Wholesale Banking.\r\nWholesale Banking income is down 2%, which is slightly lower than our expectation at the time of the pre-close, arising from delayed deal execution in Principal Finance as well as continuing weak financial markets conditions. Within this, client income, which represents 86% of Wholesale Banking, was up 4%, and own account income was down 25%.\r\nThe operating environment was impacted by a number of factors during the year. Most of these factors were either temporary or cyclical, including the high levels of liquidity in our markets, the persistently low interest rate environment, uncertainty over the pace and timing of QE tapering and indiscriminate deterioration in sentiment on emerging markets in the second half. Other factors like regulatory change impacting derivative markets were more structural in nature.\r\nExpenses were very tightly controlled, increasing only 1% year-on-year, with lower staff costs offsetting increased regulatory expenses. Furthermore, expenses were down 2% in the second half with reduced variable compensation as business performance fell, as well as tight control over hiring and BAU costs.\r\nTotal impairment rose 5% year-on-year. And within this, loan impairment was up 12%, representing 39 basis points of Wholesale Banking customer loans and advances. Other impairment was down 19%. As a result, profit before tax for Wholesale Banking is down 4%.\r\nLooking at income in more detail by product.\r\nWithin Transaction Banking, Trade income was down 4% and cash and custody income was down 5%, driven by margin compression of 27 basis points or 19% in Trade and 15 basis points or 16% in cash. We saw strong growth in both average trade balances, up 21%, and cash, up 11%. Importantly, margins are showing signs of stabilization, albeit at levels still lower than that of the first half of last year.\r\nCorporate Finance continued to perform strongly, with income up 13% on 2012. As highlighted in the pre-close, despite some delay in deal execution in the second half, income growth remains broad based, with around 70% annuity in nature and with a strong pipeline as we entered 2014.\r\nALM income was down 10% year-on-year and down 16% half-on-half, reflecting fewer derisking opportunities in the second half and the continued low interest rate environment. Weak equity markets resulted in lower revaluation gains in our Principal Finance investments, and income was down 43%. Although we saw challenging market conditions in 2013, the comparator for 2014 has eased.\r\nLooking at Financial Markets in a little more detail on the next slide. Income in Financial Markets was flat year-on-year at $3.65 billion, as strong volume growth was offset by spread compression. Within this, client income was up 7% and own account income down 25%. Market conditions deteriorated in the second half, as I mentioned earlier, and as a result, Financial Markets income overall was down 27% on the first half. Rising yields on emerging market bonds and directional uncertainty in the markets led to lower own account income. This impacted our Rates business in particular where income dropped by 1/3 compared to a strong first half. Negative emerging market sentiment also impacted income from our financial institution clients, although income from corporates remained robust, albeit in line with usual seasonal trends.\r\nOur foreign exchange business performed well, with income up 11%, driven by cash FX and FX options, supported by our continued strength in offshore renminbi. Cash FX volumes were up 21%, offsetting spread compression of 12%. And in Rates, volumes were also up 20%. Our equities business made reasonable progress, partially offsetting lower commodities income.\r\nMoving to impairment. Total impairment in Wholesale Banking was up 5% year-on-year, driven by a small number of exposures in India and Africa. These exposures drove an increase in gross nonperforming loans, up by some $900 million or 22% on 2012. This represents just over 2% of Wholesale Banking loans and advances, consistent with the levels seen in recent years. The cover ratio, given these exposures, has declined slightly to 48%, but this increases to 60% after including collateral at a forced sale value. The net at risk remains well within our observed historic recovery rates. We are also seeing signs of improving potential recovery levels and, in particular, against a number of nonperforming loans in our MESA region.\r\nThe portfolio continues to perform well, and early alerts are stable. We are not seeing any new areas of stress, but we remain watchful in India and also on the potential impact of lower commodity prices more generally.\r\nTurning to the management of risk and the shape of our portfolio. Let me just repeat some of the characteristics of our balance sheet that perhaps get taken for granted but are material points of differentiation from our peers. In Consumer Banking, the book has a continuing bias towards secured lending, with 82% of the book being either fully or partially secured at an average loan-to-value on our Mortgage book of 48%. We continued to derisk the Consumer unsecured portfolio, with Credit Cards and Personal Loans balances down 6% year-on-year. Consumer Banking 30- and 90-day delinquency rates are stable, as are Wholesale Banking early alerts.  As in earlier periods, a significant majority of \"past due but not impaired\" balances as of the balance sheet date were cured in the following month.\r\nOur portfolios are very diverse. Energy, our largest Wholesale Banking industry concentration, is around 20% of corporate exposures and, as we've shown you before, is in itself highly diversified. We maintain a short-dated Wholesale Banking book, with 64% of the book maturing in under 1 year, reflecting our Trade bias. Trade assets have the lowest propensity to loss of any Wholesale Banking asset category, with an empirical default rate of around 2 basis points.\r\nWholesale Banking is highly collateralized, with $197 billion in gross total collateral which is held at conservative forced sale values. Stick positions are down by 26% to $1.5 billion, representing less than 1% of Wholesale Banking loans and advances to customers. And finally, we continue to distribute assets successfully, with primary distribution in the year up 9% and loan sales up 29%. The portfolio is therefore diverse, short tenor, highly collateralized and showing no material signs of stress.\r\nMoving to the group's balance sheet.\r\nLiabilities. Our strong and disciplined management of the balance sheet provides us resilience and allows us to take advantages of opportunities for growth. Looking at liquidity: The balance sheet remains highly liquid with an AD ratio of 76%. 52% of customer deposits are in current and savings accounts. We have a liquid asset ratio of 30%, with over $200 billion of the balance sheet in cash or near cash. We remain a strong provider of net interbank liquidity. And we continue to exceed by a substantial degree the Basel III net stable funding ratio and the liquidity coverage ratio, and some years ahead of the required implementation dates.\r\nTurning to assets. Our loan book remains well diversified by geography, industry, counterparty and product. Loans and advances to customers were up 4%, as we continued to support our clients and customers. Risk-weighted assets grew 7%, driven in the main by asset growth, regulatory consolidation of Permata Bank and credit migration. As you can see, Wholesale Banking represents 75% of group risk-weighted assets and grew at 9%, whilst Consumer Banking remained flat.\r\nNow given the recent market focus, I would like to spend some time setting out the strength of our capital position.  \r\nLet me deal with Basel II first. The group's Core Tier 1 ratio was 11.8% at the end of 2013, the same as it was in 2010 and up some 40 basis points since the half year, the product of risk-weighted asset discipline and the phasing of operational risk, risk-weighted assets and dividend payments. Tier 1 was 13.1%, and total capital, 18%. In addition, we currently estimate our PLAC or primary loss absorbing capacity at 23%, again very robust compared to our peers'. Since our 2010 rights issue, we have very evidently self-funded balance sheet growth and the continued payment of a growing dividend. Our Core Tier 1 ratio has remained at 11.8% whilst growing risk-weighted assets by $77 billion at a CAGR of 10% and declared over $5.5 billion in dividends.\r\nTurning to Basel III. On 1st of January 2014, our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio is 10.9% on a transitional basis and rises to 11.2% on an endpoint basis. And it's not just our core equity Tier 1 that's strong. For total capital, we are again strong in absolute terms and relative to our peers. We've been active issuers of Tier 2 capital during 2013, with total capital reaching 18%. These issuances showed strong appetite for our credit and an ability to issue across markets and currencies.\r\nSo we are well capitalized today in absolute and relative terms on all metrics, including core equity Tier 1, total capital and PLAC. In addition, our leverage ratio stands at a very strong 4.7% at the year end.\r\nWe believe it will be helpful for more capital guidance to be given to the market, in particular around the interplay of the various capital buffers and, most importantly, the minimum capital levels for each individual institution. To help clarify, this slide sets out how we see Standard Chartered's capital position against minimum known requirements, which informs the guidance we have received from the PRA.\r\nWe begin with a 4.5% minimum core equity Tier 1 requirement common to all banks, a 2.5% capital conservation buffer common to all banks. It is primarily against this buffer that the Pillar 2B or PRA buffer will be assessed and where we are conservatively positioned. A 1% GSIB buffer applicable to Standard Chartered. And a 0.4% Pillar 2A core equity Tier 1 requirement, which is subject to annual review by the PRA. This totals to a known capital stack of 8.4% core equity Tier 1 capital ratio for Standard Chartered, and let's call this our capital stack.\r\nAt 10.9% core equity Tier 1, we are already significantly and materially above our capital stack, and by some 250 basis points. We are therefore substantially above the known threshold, with capacity for additional buffers. We are also today already significantly and materially ahead of the target ratios the PRA has guided us to achieve and by 2019.\r\nOn this next slide, let's look at the broader industry. It is crucial to understand that capital requirements will differ for each bank. This is the new regulatory model. The PRA's Pillar 2A guidance is different. GSIB buffers are different. Countercyclical buffers and sectoral capital requirements will be different to reflect each bank's unique business model and risk profile. Capital requirements are not uniform, nor should they be. As recent peer results demonstrate, there are variances in the end-state capital levels, with targets ranging from above 10% to 12% or above. When you think about a bank's capital strength, it is not how high the current ratios are or what the target capital ratios are. It is by how much they are above their own capital stack. Let me give you 2 examples.\r\nFirst, the GSIB capital requirements range from 0 to 2.5%, according to the different systemic risk profiles of each institution. The GSIB requirement for us at 1% is between 1% and 1.5% lower than that of other U.K.-based international banks. We were also included in the 1% category not because the calculation methodology required it but through a supervisory override. This is therefore conservative. Second, Pillar 2A guidance naturally varies from bank to bank, as it reflects the PRA's intention to capture idiosyncratic risks not included in Pillar 1. These include pension, interest rate, credit concentration and operational risks. You will note from other disclosures that this Pillar 2A buffer can be very different between banks. Our current core equity Tier 1 Pillar 2A guidance of some 40 basis points is demonstrably less than a number of our U.K. peers simply because we do not carry any material U.K. pension risk.\r\nTo summarize. Our known minimum is 8.4%. The minimum requirement for other banks is very different given they're often higher GSIB or other requirements or a Pillar 2A guidance. Our current buffer above the capital stack of some 250 basis points is clearly very strong compared to peers and positions us very well to manage future regulatory capital demands as they evolve. The laws governing the countercyclical or systemic risk buffers are not yet finalized, but when we stand back and we compare the diversity of our balance sheet and our risk profile against the 250 basis point buffer, we believe we are very strongly positioned with our current capital to absorb any capital add-on that we can see today whilst continuing to support the growth of our clients and customers.\r\nNext slide. Now despite this, the U.K. regulatory sentiment towards capital levels is clear. And there will be further model adjustments, which we currently estimate could be in the range of 30 to 50 basis points for us in 2014. And it is against this backdrop that we introduced the fifth metric to our financial framework: a commitment to gradually accrete capital over time. Whilst we expect risk-weighted assets to be up in 2014 with the introduction of Basel III and expected model changes, we intend to mitigate this by driving capital-accretive profitable growth through the fifth metric; by more assertive tail management of our existing portfolio; and by divesting certain risk-weighted assets, intensive assets and non-core businesses. The combined impact of these latter non-core disposals is expected to be some 10 to 15 basis points benefit to core equity Tier 1 in 2014. Since our Investor Day last November, we have already released $3 billion of risk-weighted assets from low-returning client relationships in Wholesale Banking, which we will look to redeploy into high-returning relationships. As we look into 2014, we have identified over $10 billion in further reductions, over 1/2 of which will be achieved in the first half.\r\nFinally and although we currently have no immediate issuance plans, the regulations now clearly strongly incentivize banks to hold up to 1.5% of risk-weighted assets as additional Tier 1 rather than common equity Tier 1. Given this, we will seek the necessary regulatory and shareholder approvals to enable us to issue these instruments in the future. Now I've spent some time on this, but hopefully, it gives you a much clearer picture of the strength of our capital position both of itself and relative to peers.\r\nSo let me conclude, and turning first to outlook. Our outlook for 2014 is, as you know, one of modest growth. Market and trading conditions are more volatile and difficult than a year ago. Whilst current performance momentum is ahead of the second half of last year, performance in this first half will remain challenged both at an income and at a profit level.\r\nAnd finally, as this is my last Full Year Results Presentation for Standard Chartered, if you will allow me just to reflect on aspects of the bank of which I am very proud. This is a bank underpinned by excellent foundations, a hugely robust balance sheet, well capitalized, highly liquid, diverse in both assets and liabilities and disciplined by a financial framework that balances growth and returns. We serve customers and clients in the growth markets of the world and have, since the financial crisis, almost doubled our lending to our customers, increasing that lending by some $190 billion doing what a bank should do. And this is an organization full of really great people.\r\nAnd I also wanted just to take the opportunity to thank you, our investors and analysts both in the room or listening via the webcast or dial-in. For the past 11 years on the board, 7 as Finance Director, and through quite remarkable period of utter change for the industry, I have really appreciated your support both personally and for the bank. I've valued our relationship and tried to answer all of your questions. I've usually enjoyed the conversations we've had. And I've also learned a great deal from all of you. So thank you.\r\nAnd let me now hand over to Peter.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nThank you, Richard. Good morning, London, and good afternoon to those of you in Hong Kong and Mumbai.\r\nAs you've heard, 2013 was a tough year. We faced margin pressures in a number of key businesses and markets. Regulatory requirements and the bank levy put upward pressure on costs. Various factors drove a sharp increase in unsecured loan impairment. And much more negative sentiment towards emerging markets affected valuations and transaction closing in Wholesale Banking. And we took goodwill impairment on our business in Korea given the severity of the challenges facing us and the industry as a whole in that market. And as a result, we slipped from our trajectory of record income and profits, posting lower income and profits for the first time in over a decade. And our share price fell, reflecting both our own performance and investor sentiment towards our markets.\r\n \r\nThis is not what we aspire to achieve. So as we saw the challenges mount and our momentum slow, we took action to mitigate the impact and to adapt to the changing environment. Some of the things we've done are unashamedly tactical, putting even tighter controls on spend and headcount, derisking certain portfolios, but the more fundamental changes relate to our strategy and how we are organizing ourselves and deploying our resources to deliver the sustainable, profitable growth and returns that drive shareholder value. That's what I want to focus on today.\r\nBut first, let me tell you how we're looking at the world. I don't need to tell you that investor sentiment towards emerging markets turned sharply from May last year and remains quite negative and jumpy. At least as far as our markets are concerned, we think this is a quite short-term, perhaps somewhat overblown, phenomenon. The longer-term attractions of Asia, Africa and the Middle East remain compelling. In fact, we expect our markets to do better in GDP growth terms in 2014 than they did in 2013, with aggregate growth rising from 2.8% to 3.5%. And the underlying drivers of economic growth across the emerging world, demographics, urbanization, rapid growth in the consuming middle class, investment in infrastructure, remain very strong. By 2030, Asia alone will add just over 2.2 billion people to the consuming middle class, taking its share of the global total to about 66%, 2/3. And when I talk to our clients, it's clear that there is some disconnect between the dynamics of global financial markets and the drivers of the real economy. Our clients see much, if not most, of their growth coming from the emerging world and particularly from Asia. They see a robust recovery in the U.S. and even a weak recovery in Europe as huge positives for Asia, Africa and the Middle East.\r\nOf course, there are economic and political risks. Some of our markets face difficult political and social transitions that could have a significant impact on business confidence. India and Indonesia face important elections this year, which will determine the pace of future reforms and GDP growth. Reshaping China's economy will create stresses, the tensions in the South China Sea pose risks. And while we're not directly exposed, we're obviously watching events in Ukraine very carefully, alert to potential lock-ons. So while it may make perfect sense for investors to rebalance their portfolios to capture the rebound in the West, the resulting negative impact on emerging market indices and valuations risks disguising the fundamental attractiveness of these markets.\r\nIn addition to the issues specific to our markets, we face some broader challenges. One is the ongoing torrent of regulatory change. The Basel III agenda is nearing completion, which is a considerable achievement and one we welcome, but this risks being undermined by a profusion of unilateral initiatives and interpretations. What the global economy needs now is consistency and stability in the international financial framework.\r\nA second big challenge, which affects the entire industry, is to rebuild trust and credibility. Put bluntly, society expects more of us. We must raise the bar on conduct so that every employee looks to comply with the spirit, not just the letter of the laws and regulations, in everything they do. In 2013, we launched a multipronged program to address this challenge. We have substantially increased resources devoted to conduct issues. We've invested in systems to enhance our controls and reduce the risk of manual errors. We've relaunched our code of conduct, requiring every member of staff to complete mandatory in-depth training and personally commit to the code. We've sharpened the way we link performance assessment and reward to personal values and behaviors. We recognize that we haven't got everything right in the past and that we've got a lot of work to do in this arena, but we are determined to raise the bar to make doing the right thing a front-of-mind imperative for everyone in the bank. That's what Here for good is all about.\r\nThe third challenge is technology. As a fundamentally digitizable industry, every aspect of banking can be transformed by technology, yet this is as much an opportunity as a threat. Through technology-driven innovation, we can empower our clients, cut costs, improve risk management, reinvent every aspect of the business. The trick is to make it happen rather than to have it happen to us. At our annual strategy board last June, we took stock of the strategy, asking tough questions about the growth potential in our markets, our ability to win market share, the impact of the more challenging regulatory and market environment. Since capital and investment spend are going to be even scarcer resources, we wanted to sharpen our focus, get really clear on what we should be investing in, where we should cut back. Our answer, which we set out for you in November, was go to the core of what we are all about. We bank the people and companies driving investment, trade and the creation of wealth across Asia, Africa and the Middle East. That's the essence of who we are. We're not trying to bank everybody, but we do want to bank those that are making things happen. We're focused on investment, trade and wealth. We're sticking to the markets we know so well: Asia, Africa and the Middle East.\r\nFrom this core statement, we distilled, first, a set of 5 strategic aspirations that flesh out how we will grow the core, and I'll put a bit more color on some of these in a moment; second, a set of 5 tests we're applying to more peripheral businesses to ensure we reinforce the core, I'll show you how we're using these; third, a significant reorganization of our regions, business and functions to ensure alignment to the strategy and to streamline the way we work; fourth, our flexed financial framework, which now has 5 metrics, including both positive jaws and capital accretion, we'll use this to explain our performance and ensure we're balancing the imperatives of near-term delivery against longer-term strategic progress; and finally, our, as it happens, 5 priorities for 2014, these are used to set personal and team objectives across the bank, ensuring that everybody is marching to the same tune.\r\nSo what you have here is an overarching framework that links strategy to performance and to the way we run the bank and to our immediate priorities. Let me expand a little on each of the elements.\r\nIn November, we set out these 5 strategic aspirations that crystallize what we want to achieve in growing the business. Our strategy revolves around relationships, not products, not transactions. We've shown you before the success we've had in deepening relationships with our biggest clients, yet we think we have scope to do much more, particularly by focusing on the next 500 clients. And we could do better in building similarly deep relationships with our smaller corporate, Private Banking and retail clients. This is one of the key reasons why we are reorganizing the business, combining Wholesale and Consumer Banking to create 3 client segment groups and 5 product groups under Mike Rees, who is sitting up here today and will join us in answering questions.\r\nFor example, by creating the commercial client segment, we'll make it much easier to focus on the needs of mid-sized corporate clients. Such middle-sized companies are a huge part of the economies in which we operate, up to 60%, and represent a rapidly growing component of the banking revenue pool, yet up to now, we have failed to make the most of this opportunity. We've fragmented our efforts between Wholesale and Consumer Banking and generate less than 10% of our total income from this important client segment. Now we will take a much more integrated approach. Through targeting high-growth and exporting industries and being more efficient in onboarding, we'll grow the client base by leveraging our network and full product capability. We'll make ourselves more relevant and deepen relationships. And when these clients get bigger, we'll transition them up to our Corporate and Institutional client segment, much easier now that we are organized as one global business.\r\nAlso, grouping our commercial clients with our Private Banking business will massively facilitate cross-referral. The new commercial segment will start with about 50,000-or-so clients, mainly entrepreneurial family-owned groups that are the perfect target market for Private Banking. Yet up to now, a very small proportion have become Private Banking clients an obvious opportunity. Indeed, the scale of the Private Banking opportunity across our markets is enormous. Today, there is some $10 trillion of assets under management, AUM, from high-net-worth individuals in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. By 2017, this number should more than double.\r\nAnd we start with a very good platform with $58 billion in AUM, good product capabilities, experienced relationship managers and a network of advisory and booking centers, but we can scale up and enhance our offer, leveraging our client franchise and network more effectively. A great example is the Africa-to-London corridor, which we are superbly positioned to serve given our extensive African footprint and London advisory and booking center.\r\nBut the greater emphasis we're putting on Private Banking is just one element of the way we are stepping up our efforts in the Wealth Management arena. Given the pace of individual wealth accumulation across our markets and the relatively early stage in the development of these markets, there's a huge opportunity to provide our retail and Private Banking clients with Wealth Management products and services. This is already a substantial business for us, generating income of $1.3 billion in 2013, but this is only the beginning. Our aspiration is to more than double assets under management by 2020 to $300 billion. That's why we're elevating Wealth Management from being a product group within Consumer Banking to sit alongside our well-established Wholesale Banking product groups in the new structure, like Corporate Finance, Transaction Banking and Financial Markets, which are already all much bigger.\r\nTurning to trade and payments. This is at the heart of what Standard Chartered is all about. We are already a top 2 trade bank by SWIFT data. Our goal is to be #1. We continue to win market share, with average trade assets up by 21% in 2013 against market growth of around 6%. Of course, Trade income was affected by the sharp fall in margins, but we are clearly well placed to benefit as margins stabilize. And we're taking advantage of the shift towards companies using the renminbi for trade and payments.\r\nFrom virtually nothing in 2009, some 16% of China's trade, just over $730 billion, is now settled in renminbi. By 2020, we think this will more than quadruple to over $3 trillion. To give a sense of the pace at which the renminbi is being internationalized: The Standard Chartered Renminbi Globalization Index, which measures all aspects of offshore renminbi activity, went up 84% in 2013, whilst our own international renminbi payment flows were up 122%. And new things are happening all the time. In December, we launched renminbi clearing in London via a joint venture with Agricultural Bank of China. Last month, we executed the first renminbi cross-border sweeping transaction for a company based in the new Shanghai free-trade zone.\r\nTo create the capacity to achieve our strategic aspirations, we need to sharpen our focus. We've therefore been systematically subjecting those businesses that are underperforming or less aligned to our core strategy to 5 tests, asking tough questions about their strategic relevance, alignment with Here for good and sustainable economics. As a result, we are exiting or reconfiguring a number of smaller businesses. And just as important is being more selective about our client relationships. We're exiting or reshaping relationships, both big and small, which offer no prospect of attractive returns, making clear to our clients that, to be sustainable, our relationships have to be economically attractive for both sides. And this has made for some tough conversations. We're also continuing to take action on our most underperforming or problematic businesses, above all, Korea.\r\nAs Richard said, our business in Korea had an extremely challenging 2013, with profits down, before the goodwill impairment, $527 million to a loss of $13 million. Much of this was due to a sharp fall in Consumer Banking performance given elevated levels of impairment, up 66%, and income falling by 12%, partly as a result of selective derisking of the unsecured book and the charge we've taken on the prospective sale of 2 small subsidiaries. Weak underlying trading performance was exacerbated by a one-off tax-related charge of $54 million and the non-repeat of last year's property sales which had contributed income of $74 million. Against this, one positive factor was the continued strength of our network income relating to Korean clients, a significant and growing revenue stream of over $200 million.\r\nOf course, we weren't alone in encountering difficulties in Korea. 6 of the 7 major banks saw income and profits fall by double-digit rates, and average ROE was below 3%, the lowest for a decade. As the sixth largest player in the industry, we can't entirely escape the dynamics of the industry, yet neither can we tolerate such underperformance since it creates such a drag on the performance of the bank as a whole, so we are continuing to take action on multiple fronts. There's no silver bullet, but we're shrinking the businesses while very selectively investing to support the areas of most opportunity.  In 2013, we reduced risk-weighted assets in Korea by 7%. In 2014, we will reduce it further.\r\nWe're simplifying the structure selling off more consumer finance and savings bank subsidiaries, and we'll reduce the number of legal entities from 9 to 3. We're reducing costs as fast as we can given the constraints, with staff numbers down by nearly 400 year-on-year. We're consolidating the branch network, down by 24 during 2013, as we increasingly interact with our clients through digital means. We're redeploying capital in Wholesale Banking from locally oriented clients towards clients that can benefit from our network. And we're selectively derisking the unsecured book in Consumer Banking and putting greater emphasis on Wealth Management. As a result of these actions, our business in Korea will be smaller, more profitable, more focused on where we can play to our strengths, but given the constrained context, we cannot achieve this transformation as swiftly as we would like. Korea will continue to be very challenging through 2014.\r\nIn November, we showed you what we described as our flexed financial framework, setting out the metrics we would aspire to deliver over the next couple of years. As we've said before, these are aspirations. And we don't expect that we will always be able to deliver against all of them, we clearly haven't in the past, but they give you a sense of what it is we're setting out to achieve. We said we did not expect to deliver double-digit income growth over the next couple of years given various pressures, not least Korea. However, we haven't abandoned double-digit growth as a longer-term aspiration. Given the scale of the opportunities in our markets, we believe this remains a stretching but realistic aspiration. Of course, we're not going to compromise our risk appetite or strategic discipline to chase growth. If market circumstances only support somewhat slower growth, that's what we will deliver.\r\nTo protect the earnings momentum in an environment of slower income growth, we're shifting from a stance of broadly neutral cost-income jaws towards aiming to deliver positive jaws, i.e. costs growing more slowing than income. This will be challenging given inflationary and regulatory pressures, the bank levy and the measures we're trying -- we're taking to constrain RWA growth. And we must also keep creating the capacity to keep investing for growth. This means we must generate several hundred millions of dollars of productivity benefits every year. We did this in 2013 and we intend to keep doing it. Delivering positive jaws should help us towards our aspirations for earnings per share growth even at sub-double-digit rates of income growth. This in turn will help us continue to improve returns on equity. We already deliver returns above our cost of capital, and we'll continue to look to improve returns whilst also paying out a good level of dividends, as we have consistently done.\r\nIn November, we also introduced our fifth metric of growing profits after tax faster than RWA. As Richard has said, we have broadly funded our RWA growth through retained earnings and we are in a strong position in terms of capital ratios, yet given the ongoing uncertainty about regulatory expectations, we think it makes sense to manage for a positive capital trajectory to give us greater flexibility and resilience.\r\nSo what are our priorities for 2014? They flow very naturally from our strategic aspirations and financial framework. First, to deliver profitable and capital-accretive growth. After a disappointing performance in 2013, we are determined to get back to delivering the kind of results you expect from us. This won't happen automatically or overnight. Given the weakness of our Q4 performance, we anticipate that the first half of 2014 will prove challenging, but we are confident that the actions we are taking will give us the platform to deliver sustained and profitable growth.\r\nSecond, to make tangible progress on our 5 strategic aspirations. Here is where the reorganization will make a difference because it will enable us to put a sharper focus on the key strategic priorities, optimizing the deployment of capital and investment spend.\r\nThird, to innovate, digitize and simplify to improve productivity and effectiveness. For us to simultaneously deliver positive jaws and keep investing for growth, we have to be delivering significant productivity improvements every year, and that requires constant innovation, a bias towards digitizing everything we can and a relentless focus on simplifying and streamlining the way we work. Here again, the reorganization will help. We can strip out some duplications and drive greater standardization.\r\nFourth, to raise the bar on conduct, demonstrating that we are Here for good. This is a strategic imperative.\r\nAnd finally, to accelerate the next generation of leaders. The reorganization gives us a real opportunity to do this.\r\n2013 was not a great year for the bank. 2014 will inevitably bring its own challenges, but we are very clear on what we have to do. We're making changes to adapt to the new realities. We have a strong balance sheet and we have great client relationships and superb capabilities.\r\nI'd like to take this opportunity to thank all our staff for their hard work, commitment and professionalism during 2013. I'd particularly like to thank Richard for all he has done in his 11 years as a director, including 7 by my side as Finance Director. And I'd like to thank Steve for his leadership in transforming our Consumer Banking business over the last 5 years. And finally, I'd like to thank you, our analysts and investors, for your support through these turbulent times.\r\nI guess, well, Ben and Julian will now take any questions in Hong Kong. Sunil and Anurag will do the same in Mumbai. John, Richard, Mike and I will take your questions in London. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text3": "Now we're going to do this usual way, if you could put your hand up, wait for the mic, and when you get the mic, if you could say your name and the institution you're from. Why don't we start up front with Sandy?\n\n---\n\nIt's Sandy Chen from Cenkos Securities. Just 2 questions, 1 on NPLs. The -- if you could reconcile the movement in NPLs versus the impairment allowances on Pages, I think, 39 through 43 and in particular the increase in Wholesale NPLs. And also if we can get a bit of a regional -- or sort of a country-by-country break, why is Korea going down in terms of impairment allowances and things like that. The -- and the second question is a broader question. Looking at the Commercial and Private Banking division and also wealth, the -- for Commercial and Private Banking, obviously, it's a -- it's -- Private Banking is already a well-banked proposition. I mean what's the edge that you intend to bring, probably this is a question for Alun, and that will allow you to get the customers away from existing other private banks? And also comparing the Private Bank versus the wealth proposition, I mean what are the key differences between those 2 propositions?\n\n---\n\nWhat I'll do is I'll ask Mike to comment on the second one. And do you want to start by addressing the...\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible] the wholesale NPLs. You may work in contact with [ph] specifics [indiscernible] picture as our percentages. The NPLs in Wholesale are up 22%, 930 million up. It's a handful of accounts that have largely contributed to that. You actually look at the levels of collateral actually applied to those. It's also up equivalently around 21%. It's a level of NPLs which is wholly consistent with that which we've seen, actually, all the way back -- it's all the way back, I suppose, to 2005. I'll stop to that point. It's been around a --  it's been running at around that level over that period. As I say, there are 3 or 4 accounts in there that actually create the increase. They're predominantly in Africa where we had a couple of those, and India. With regard to India, it's offshore booked. The Africa accounts are both in commodities space, actually. One is in hard commodities, it's mining, where there were production issues in the underlying mine. And we've taken conservative provisions on that. The other, actually, is in agribusiness, the soft commodities. And we'd only provided that at the first half. We added to the provision when we looked at our collateral treatment. And I think, again, we've moved to a conservative positioning on that. So it's basically comes down to a small number of individual accounts which have gone to nonperforming in this period, but in terms of trend, it remains very consistent with the levels that we've seen over the past few years, I think.\n\n---\n\nAnd Mike, do you want to comment on Private Banking and also the relationship between Private Banking and wealth? I mean I would just say one thing, which is one of the key differentiators we have is we already have relationships with these people. We just haven't been providing them with Private Banking services up to now. And that's why there is a logic to grouping commercial and private. But Mike, do you want to comment?\n\n---\n\nYes. Let me just pick up on a couple of thing Peter said in his presentation. So first of all, 60% of the GDP of the countries we operate in relates to medium-sized enterprises. And those are companies between $10 million, $200 million of revenue. And the other 60% is that -- 60% of the growth, world's growth, in high-net-worth individuals are going to come over the next 3 years in our market. Actually, the 2 things are linked because what's going on and through the life cycle of those companies is that their business wealth is growing and their personal wealth are growing. And so what we want to capture is the -- both the business growth wealth as those companies grow through their life cycle, but also as it splits between personal and business wealth, to start to bank them at that juncture. Our advantage is capture them at that juncture, not when they become multibillionaires and try to compete at that stage, because most of these companies are actually family-owned promoter groups, and that's the sort of heritage of Standard Chartered. And we haven't quite got that linked together before. So we've got 50,000 -- about 50,000 or 60,000 medium-sized enterprises now alongside the Private Bank. And if we can get that moment in their life cycle when that business and personal wealth starts to separate and as companies grow, that's the competitive advantage we have.\n\n---\n\nAnd to your point about wealth and Private Banking. Wealth is going to be a product group in the same way that Financial Markets is or Corporate Finance is, and that will be supporting both the retail segment and the Private Banking segment with products. But so you have a group that is focused on a product capability and specialist sales and advice in the same way that we have done in Transaction Banking, for example. So it's a way of combining both product strength and a relationship focus.\n\n---\n\nAnd just building on that, the one thing you know from history is, when we get focused on something, we succeed. So if you think about over the last 10 years, we started with no Corporate Finance business, we built it  to $2.5 billion of revenue. If you think about Private Banking, started in 2007, we built AUM at a 30% compound annual growth rate. So when we get focused, we get real traction, real delivery. So you look back in history, and we've succeeded where we focused.\n\n---\n\nShould we stay on this side and just slip down? And then I'll go over to that side. So yes, whichever.\n\n---\n\nIt's Mike Trippitt at Numis. Two questions. On costs, as you've highlighted, 1 -- sort of 1% growth, with a lot of headwinds in terms of regulation, inflation, et cetera. Can you just give a sense of sensitivity on 2014 in terms of -- it looks like headcount has come down at the end of '13, so maybe BAU has come down, but there's inflation in there. Has investment been deferred from 2013? I'm just trying to sort of get a handle on the sensitivities on the 2014 cost base.\n\n---\n\nThe -- I mean, going in a -- the first thing to say is we are -- unsurprisingly, I think, given our comments around how we kind of see conditions, we're holding costs pretty tight. So we're gating in the -- we're holding the gate quite tight on investment release basis [ph]. But our going-in assumption for the year will be for a slight increase in headcount. I mean the budget has a 1,000 headcount increase. Our inflation assumptions are broadly the same levels as last year, again for the budget purposes, so you'd look at an underlying inflationary pressure coming in at sort of 4% to 5% again is what we have in the budgets. But as Peter said, I think it's -- the task to repeat, as we did successfully this last year and in prior years, is to achieve significant productivity benefits. And I remember, it was at the Investor Day that we showed you some of the productivity benefits we get, particularly in some of the wholesale platforms. And if I remember, FX, we had a 100 -- a 52% lift in income, plus 6% lift in underlying costs given the investment in platforms. And you see the same in Trade volumes. So I think it's about taking productivity benefits to offset pretty similar -- going-in assumptions pretty similar to that which we saw last year. We've got good investment budgets in there. In 2013, we went in with good investment budgets. We stayed pretty well with those in Wholesale. Wholesale investment was up about 11%, but we cut back on Consumer Banking investment and did less branch opening than we were going to do and focused more of our investment on digital in a number of the markets. So if that's CB and consumer, I think cut our investment spend by about 50%.\n\n---\n\nWe'll choose, say, one more on this side, and then we'll go to that side.\n\n---\n\nIt's Rohith Chandra-Rajan of Barclays. Two really just points of clarification, if I could, please. First, on capital. I just wanted to check what's included in the 11.2% endpoint Basel III Core Tier 1. So firstly, in terms of mitigation, the RWA reduction looks like about 20 basis points of benefit. Just wanted to check that and also get your indication of what the derivatives clearing, centralized clearing on derivatives, would be. And then secondly, just in terms of some of the regulatory change headwinds. You talked, at the time of the pre-close, about 20 to 40 basis points from large corporate exposures. I don't know if that's in that 11.2% or not, or if that's part of the 30 to 50 you expect this year. And also, the 30 basis point dividend impact, which is a timing difference, again, is that in the number, or is it part of the expectation for this year?\n\n---\n\nLet me try and help. So on the -- we have -- the foreseeable dividends is not included in there. We made a comment in the press release that, assuming our normal scrip assumption, how much, it's around 25% [ph], I think, the foreseeable dividend's one-step adjustment, if required, is around 30 basis points. So you take that off the 11.2% endpoint, which will take you to 10.9% for that. On the last point you raised, in terms of models, one of the reasons we came in, I think, higher than most of you expected, I think, on the ratio at 10.9% is that we had talked to you about a real expectation of a model adjustment coming through on EAD. And that really is adjusting the pay factor, which is the momentum, the momentum factor attaching to corporates headroom and limits. And I think it was an adjustment to the momentum component. We think that's about a 30 basis point model adjustment. That is at the bottom, therefore, of the range we were indicating for '14. We think that is going to come in. We think it's likely to come in, in this first half. It will probably have impact on other banks, I don't know the extent to which it is the same impact on other banks. Staying with that theme, if I might: On the models, we've said we think 30 to 50. The other 2 main components of potential models are essentially loan portfolios, predominantly in corporate, but also FI. There's a very large component which is potentially the unsecured LGD requirement on unsecured FI exposures. We honestly don't know where that's coming in. We would step back, from a policy perspective, Peter spoke about this, and argue that perhaps it isn't very sensible to put a 45% LGD on unsecured FI exposures, which is what happens through interbank. So I don't know whether that comes in or not. And then there are some mitigations that we're expecting. There are some mid-corporate PD adjustments and some CAD 2 on FX and there is some CAD 2 on equities. Those elements net out to a 30 to 50 basis points. If we don't get the LGD adjustments, it's quite possible that the EAD of 30 will be lower by getting some of the mitigants. So our best estimate today is this 30 to 50 basis points of model adjustment. There's probably a lot more that you...\n\n---\n\nThere's a little bit of mitigation and...\n\n---\n\nAh, yes, so the mitigations. So if you get to transitional, we've got CVA and AVC. So CVA and AVC are $8 billion and $5.5 billion. There's also another $2 billion or so coming through from some RWA threshold adjustments. We have got some mitigation to those, which is about $6.4 billion. And the current regulations basically in our options businesses, particularly, for us, FX, commodities and currencies. And to bite through, you are required to risk-weight them gross, in other words, without a line to offset. So you actually take RWA on each of the options disconnected Basel III, allows you to offset, which is where we manage the book and actually the way actually the business runs. So you'll get about a $6.4 billion, $6.3 billion offset predominantly as you net-off options which are matched in terms of both economic and financial management. You bring those down and there's about a $9 billion, I think, of risk-weighted increase at the transitional level. You then adjust that for mitigation, which is an internal management methodology. And you've got moved to central clearing, that's about $6 billion. And then I'll do the capital if you want, but you probably have had enough. So...\n\n---\n\nI mean, just going back [indiscernible]. I mean the picture you should take away is there are a lot of things that could -- are still unfolding in terms of the capital picture. And some of them are perfectly sensible changes that the regulators are putting in place, some we think are more questionable. Firstly, I don't really see the logic of the foreseeable dividends thing because it is a subsequent decision and just to key management lever. If you were under pressure on capital, you would act on your dividend. You -- so to sort of make it automatic and built-in seems to me like kind of a curious thing to do, but...\n\n---\n\nYou missed that. You just put a sign and saying, \"We'll miss you...\"\n\n---\n\nBut the -- there's a -- given all that, what's important is that we are at a very strong starting point with a significant buffer over the things we know we have to meet and we are managing for capital accretion. Right, should we go over this side? Ah, that's -- what's his name again?\n\n---\n\nYou can never remember?\n\n---\n\nTom.\n\n---\n\nIt's Michael Adrian -- Tom, Tom Rayner from Exane BNP Paribas. Just to stay on the same theme: I mean there were 2 surprises from my point of view, on RWAs in the results: firstly, the sort of extent of the slowdown in the second half, this is just on a Basel II basis; and then secondly, the small impact of moving to CRD IV endpoint. So I have questions on both of those. On the first, I mean how exactly have you achieved that sort of slowdown in the second half? Is it sustainable? And could you talk about the impacts on revenue, profits and returns going forward, and the sort of measures you've taken and whether they continue? And then on -- secondly and coming sort of Rohith's point on mitigation, I'm assuming this is mitigation that you've not yet put into place. And the dividend issue as well is something -- may not be sensible but it's something which is -- it looks like it's happening. So I would look at your 11.2% on an endpoint and I take off the 40 for the dividend and the 20 for the mitigation and say you're really at 10.6%, which is still not bad versus 8.4%. So then I'd look at your 8.4% and say, well, there's lots of other things here that are going to get added on. Countercyclical, sectoral add-ons going to get you to 9.5%, 10%. You're going to have to run with 1% above that as a sensible management sort of position. So I think go to -- you're looking at 11% versus 10.6% today, which again isn't disastrous, but I think it does mean that your whole management of RWAs versus dividends is a little bit more tricky than you're kind of suggesting. So I just wondered if you could comment on all of those things, please, just to sort of wrap it up.\n\n---\n\nWell, why don't we start with the specific issue around the slowing of the growth of RWA in the second half of last year, and because most of the action was in the Wholesale Banking business? Mike, why don't you comment on all the actions we have taken there?\n\n---\n\nOkay. If you go back to the Investor Day, you'll remember we talked about specific things we were doing to get returns up and grow revenue. One was the top -- the next 500 clients, but we also talked about the suboptimal clients as well. And we talked about the progress we've made. And what we did was turned up the heat on that. So in the back end of the year, as Richard alluded to earlier, we got about a $3 billion save out of suboptimal clients, which in addition to that, we also got a 12 -- 14 basis points uplift on the return on those clients as well. So that was the predominant lever we pulled to really intensify our focus on those suboptimal clients. And that will roll into this year. We're targeting around about another $10 billion of RWAs saves from this year. The one thing I'd caution you is, don't build all that into your models because your other point was very valid as well, which is clearly we're going to start with the easy ones to do, and the ones which have more income impact, we'd leave for later. So we will be redeploying some of that $10 billion of savings into high-yielding assets to mitigate the income drag of that save. So it's a very intensive program we're running, and we told you about at the investment day, and that was the large piece of the lever we pulled towards the year end. And it's continuing to this year.\n\n---\n\nThe boarder comment on...\n\n---\n\nAll right. Yes, I think it's going to be a subject of a broader discussion between us, actually, because I think that the fundamental thrust of what we're trying to make sure people understand, and I know you do, is that point about it's a surplus over the requirement that matters in a world where the regulatory world is no longer a common threshold for banks. The idea of the common threshold stops at the 4.5%, and then you start getting differences. It was even the 2.5% is where the Pillar 2B buffer gets assessed. So every buffer that goes over the 4.5% is bespoke. And the important thing is to what extent are you above that requirement. To your numbers, 11.2%, adjust for the dividend, I think that's 30. You could say 40 if we're  getting a scrip. We've never not had scrip. It's a reasonable assumption, I think. So I think 30 to 10.9%. And yes, there will be model adjustments. Either take it down to 10.5%, 10.6%. Add 15 basis points, 10 to 15 basis points, for the current disposal by the end of this year, listen to our language about risk-weight efficiencies, another $10 billion taken out this year out of Wholesale and redeployed to higher return. But $10 billion will be the -- will be a reduction from our base load expectations. And we're going to continue to manage well. In terms of the surprise, I don't -- I never wanted to surprise you. We -- it really is fundamentally the fact that, the EAD model, we had fully expected it to bite by the end of -- in the second half of last year. And then there was some RWA efficiency, I think it would have been around 20 basis points higher than we had thought for those I'll call them more organic management of risk weight, as Mike has talked to. But then, Tom, it does come back to, one, we're accretive, fifth metric. We're committing to that. Two, we've got disposals. Three, we've got the risk-weight discipline. Fourthly, it's about the surplus. And that surplus, you see, you have to do -- if you say it's about 11% of charge, there's a risk that you fall into, I think, the old, the similar misconception, trying to set some sort of threshold. The way to test yourself on the threshold is to do the capital stacks with our peers and then say, \"Okay, Standard Chartered, if you're at 11%, what do I know that, that means other banks have got to be traveling at as a minimum?\" And are you asking for that? And more important, as the regulators look, they can see our capital stack of 8.4%. It informs their target guidance for us. And just to reassert it because I think it is very important to understand this, we are quite significant -- we are materially ahead of the target capital ratio that the PRA is guiding us to achieve by 2019.  Today we are significantly and materially ahead of it. So...\n\n---\n\nAnd Peter, maybe just -- could I just pin you down on your 2014 priority? When you say profitable and capital-accretive growth, what exactly...\n\n---\n\nWe're talking again with organic. We're talking against organic. It is very...\n\n---\n\nWhat exactly does that mean? Does that mean the ROE and the CET 1 ratio are both going to rise this year? Is that a good way of interpreting that?\n\n---\n\nNo. What we're saying is that, in that financial framework, we've added, for the steering of the group, a fifth metric. We also said, when we introduced it, you won't see us beat -- get a good beat on that metric when you're getting a step-in one-off adjustment. So for instance, you get full model hit of 50 basis points, that's quite a difficult increment to get past in terms of organic growth. And nor would you expect it, nor would you want us, I suspect, to try and grow to do that. But against the organic growth of the business, we are going to be managing it at a return for that business on a way that is capital accretive, but we won't in one reporting period. We are also to absorb one-off step changes from a singular model arrival.\n\n---\n\nAnd the way you should look at the priorities is basically the comfort as to the signals by sounding we're the organization as to what we want the business to achieve. These are priorities that we cascade internally. And they're all about the emphasis we're putting on returns, on capital accretion, on very disciplined growth. Growth in its own right is not good enough, it needs to be profitable and capital accretive. And that -- this isn't just something that we articulate at the board level or the Finance Director or whatever, it's something that we're driving through the disciplines of the business. Michael, in front.\n\n---\n\nIt's Michael Helsby from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. I've got 3 quick questions. Firstly, just going back to this Wholesale NPL, Richard. You explained Africa, I think, which makes sense. I think the big chunk was in offshore. And there's about $0.5 billion of higher NPLs. And actually, the bad debt provision went down, and it was only very, very small to start off with, so -- and then if you could just explain, because that looks very specific, some things are very notable going on there. Second question is in Korea. I think, Peter, you stressed there will be another drag, which I think you told us before about in Korea, in 2014. I think the drag was 13 million PBT-wise. Can you size the drag? I know that's hard, but if you can give us a ballpark, that will be helpful. And then finally, just to go back to what Bob was saying over the -- sorry, Tom. The -- I'm just trying to square the circle, which is that your -- to use your words, you're materially above the minimum capital requirement. The -- so I'm just trying to square the circle on the dividend policy, the fifth metric, and the -- and that very strong capital position that you've got. So if earnings are -- growth is 0 in 2014, I know that's not what you're suggesting, but if they were, would that mean dividends are flat in 2014? So is it the dividend that you are going to flex?\n\n---\n\nCan I take the last one first? Which is we fully understand the importance to shareholders as -- of a progressive dividend policy. We have multiple levers we can pull in terms of driving capital accretion. And it depends on the scenario and precisely how you get to that scenario, which levers that are the most attractive ones to pull, but we are showing you that we are actively pulling 2 levers in particular at the moment. One is extension of RWA or pulling back on RWA to low-returning clients. And two is disposal of businesses that aren't either strategically aligned or performing. And three is taking action on businesses that aren't giving us good returns. So it isn't the case. The dividend is the only lever that we have to pull and it's a lever that we would be extremely thoughtful about pulling.\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible] dividend flat on the second half of last year. Those are -- yes, you did pull the lever on dividend this year...\n\n---\n\nYes, if you do the math, that's not a realistic -- that's not a -- it doesn't make any difference at all to our capital ratios to make very small changes in any 1 year to the percentage of the dividend. So I mean if we were using that as a lever, it's not a very useful lever...\n\n---\n\nIt's a big signaling...\n\n---\n\nThe signal that you should take is our demonstrable record of paying increasing dividends, which we have done for a very long time. Second, I'll do Korea, and then I'll hand it back to you on the NPL in U.K. On -- look, I'm not going to give you a precise number on where we're going to end up on Korea. There's a lot of moving parts where a lot of it depends on things like our success in derisking the unsecured portfolio. We would anticipate loan impairment falling in the second half of the year, but there's a lot of external factors that drive this. What we're certainly not expecting -- when you think about it in terms of P&L drag, what we're not expecting is the same negative delta of $527 million that we experienced in 2013. But we are saying, look, we can't do all the things we want to do as fast as we would like, so it's not a quick fix. We know what we're trying to do. So this year will continue to be pretty difficult. Do you want a pick up on...\n\n---\n\nOn the -- I think you can see it in the OBU [ph] in the U.K. segment. And fundamentally, if you look at the U.K. segment, it's not just one account, it's a number of accounts. But this -- a majority of the increase is predominantly on one account, and it's an account held at fair values. It's predominantly a stick position there for whole fair value through the trading book. We've taken a negative income discount on that amount -- on that -- sorry, on that exposure as we fair-valued it through the..\n\n---\n\nSo it's $0.5 billion...\n\n---\n\nIt's not. There's an increase in the U.K. segment of about that amount. It is not $0.5 billion. But the majority of the increase in the geography is one account. The rest of it obviously is in other accounts. And we're comfortable with where they are.\n\n---\n\nShould we go here, [indiscernible]? So I'm just conscious of giving...\n\n---\n\nChintan Joshi here from Nomura. 2 questions and 1 quick follow-up. Your outlook comments of modest growth for 2014. Could you just elaborate what do you mean modest for revenues, volumes? It would be helpful. Second, can you set some expectations for Trade or Transaction Banking for 2014? What have you seen in the initial months of this year on kind of margins, volumes, and what you have in your plans? And the clarification was, you said you'll reduce RWAs by about $10 billion and reinvest them in high-yielding assets. What are we talking about when you mean high-yielding assets?\n\n---\n\nThe last one just real clearly is similar customer. So it's not the same customers but customers who allow us essentially to cross-sell or upsell. It's not a cross to an investment portfolio. It's actually, as we look at the customers, if it's Trade, then we'll sell in Trade, which is a low-return business, actually. Trade works if we get the upsell. If we don't get the upsell, actually, why are we putting our balance sheet there? And so removing those risk weights to those customers who will give us, who will buy from us the other risk management products that are attached. It's not getting a cross-reinvestment...\n\n---\n\nAnd do you, Mike, want to just comment on Trade and cash as the main components of Transaction Banking?\n\n---\n\nSo throughout last year, I mean the core element, despite the challenging markets, was stay close to our strategy. And our strategy was about staying close to our clients. And I go back to the point Peter made earlier about the disconnect between what's going on in GDP growth and what's going on in Financial Markets. And you can see that in 2 halves of our P&L. So our client volumes, our client business grew pretty well. I mean, even FM, which in the market is challenged, was up 7% on client income, but underpinning that is we're staying close to our clients. And they were seeing GDP growth, was -- our volumes were up. So what we're seeing this year on the volume side is a continuation of the theme. What we're seeing on the margin side is, particularly on Trade, margins are stabilizing. They wobble around a bit depending on here and there, but Chinese banks are paying up in the dollar market at the moment, you see that reflecting through the Trade front. But overall, margins are stabilizing and we're continuing to get the volume growth.\n\n---\n\nIt's quite, I mean, right [ph]. I mean so we had -- the margins went up about 115 basis points. We have seen the growth of Trade, they're broadly stabilized around that level of capital. In the markets, we're seeing margins up, actually. So there's an upwards direction on [indiscernible]. In terms of Trade margins, Singapore. So that's the Chinese -- only Chinese impact. But elsewhere, there's some still slight decline and the overall picture for our margins in Trade are currently flat. Volumes are up on last year for the start of the year.\n\n---\n\nAnd as for modest growth, it's a deliberately expensive phrase because there's a lot of uncertainty, it's very early in the year. But we do anticipate that, broadly speaking, the business will grow, will see modest growth.\n\n---\n\nIt's Manus Costello from Autonomous. I've just got a question about the structure of your balance sheet. If I look at your Americas, U.K., Europe division, which has always been an enigma, but it's grown its share of deposits. From a percent of the group deposits, it's grown by more than 100 basis points. This year, it's grown by about 5% since precrisis. And so my questions are, has that happened as a result of a deliberate strategy? Or is it just because people have been parking deposits with you as a safe international institution over the last few years? And following on from that, as the West recovers, as rates rise, as people maybe find other places to park their deposits, how is that going to impact your growth and your margins over the next few years if you don't have that source of liquidity?\n\n---\n\nSo it's -- I mean it's probably regulatory driven, actually. It's where, as you look at an international group, you want to leave your -- you want your deposits placed. So it's partly trade with regulatory influence, particularly in Americas and U.K. And that -- so that is the main driver. And then actually, if you look at the rate of increase generally across the balance sheet, it won't be that far out, if you adjust for that factor, than elsewhere. So increasingly, we are holding levels of liquidity in our home market and in our core clearing market. And there are regulatory requirements, if you're going to be significantly unclear about the -- around liquidity balances you hold against that business.\n\n---\n\nShall we go right? Chris?\n\n---\n\nIt's Chris Manners from Morgan Stanley. I had 2 questions for you. So the first one was just on competitiveness of the Standard Chartered in the sort of high-capital world. It does look like at least the PRA is putting some super equivalents on yourselves versus where your international peers are. How are you able to price competitively if you need to hold high capital? And how do you think about that competitiveness point? And the second one was just on pro-cyclicality of risk-weighted assets. Obviously, Asian defaults have been very low over recent years. They're starting to pick up. Do you think that a pickup in Asian defaults will cause some credit migration, which would then inform higher risk weights? And also, you see things like the HKMA jacking up risk-weighted sort of mortgages. Have you got any other areas where you can see sort of countercyclical measures that may push up your risk ratings?\n\n---\n\nDo you want to do pro-cyclicality? On the broader sort of competitiveness implications of sort of different capital requirements in different places, I mean this is part of the reference I made to sort of interpretations in unilateral initiatives. One of the concerns I have about the way the whole sort of Basel III thing is actually being translated into reality is there are a lot of different flavors. And that does have competitive implications. It isn't all one way though. If you look at some of our local bank competitors, actually, they operate at quite high levels of core equity. The accounting potential standards vary from market to market, so it's not a uniform picture. I mean I think the only answer I can give to that is we see huge merit in getting greater standardization across these kinds of metrics. And competition is not going to be completely driven on the price of your balance sheet. If it were, we wouldn't have been able to win as much market share as we have demonstrably done over the last few years. It's also driven by the quality of products and services and the way you build the relationship.\n\n---\n\nI think, in going forward, you should also think about competitiveness not only just in terms of capital models against liquidity, but also conduct of business. So you look at how things like the Volcker rule and look at how CFTC rules are affecting some of the global banks now and what they can do and who they can do business with, it's getting more and more complex. And I think, that upheld, we just think it's about capital liquidity. It's about a whole broader range of measures coming out through conduct of business regulation as well.\n\n---\n\nAnd generally speaking, as an international bank operating in lots of other jurisdictions against competition from local banks, we -- our starting assumption is that the playing field is tilted against us. I mean that's -- yes, that's our operating assumption. So [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\nLook, so I'll just pick on some of the specifics. I mean I think the HKMA is an interesting point. I -- they have increased the floor essentially, increased the risk rate on mortgages. They didn't do it for historic book, they brought it in for new bookings and contrast that with the Scandinavian region. So it's not just in Asian markets that you've got potential lift to underlying risk rate. In terms of, again, the book, I think, it -- remember a short tenor. So as you reflect on the fact that 64% of the wholesale business is short tenor, largely trade, it reprices. It reprices, actually, to reflect risk. It reprices to reflect capital, services. And that we sit there with a 10-year bullet structure and just watch see what happens. Actually, we are moving with the markets in terms of making our facilities available to our clients and pricing for the risk accordingly. This year, we had a $9 billion negative credit migration. You'll see in the actual numbers. An element of that, actually, was for the change in policy that we had. We changed policy around treatment to parental support [ph] and how we applied that, and that caused some increase. Our historic long run -- our long-run rates of credit migration are around $3 billion. This year, going into '14, we've got our assumption of between $5 billion and $6 billion for negative credit migration. We clearly take it into significant account. And when we run stress tests, it's part of all the scenarios that we run in terms of what happens in stresses to the underlying risk weight as essentially for default probabilities movement. So I think we are all over the point. Remember, the balance sheet is short tenor. Remember, it's not just Asia. Actually, where you've got regulatory -- not interference, regulatory adjustments to mortgage floors, as your example. And we've gone into this year with a very substantial, I think, assumption within our planning around negative credit migration.\n\n---\n\nOne of the other issues also, Chris, is that -- which I know that the regulators are thinking about and debating through this atmosphere and so on, is the interplay between our pro-cyclicality in the RWA measures and the kind of cyclical buffer because, actually, the 2 should operate in opposite directions, right, because otherwise, they're both trying to do the same thing. And the one thing that they are very keen to avoid is having the regulatory system exacerbate the natural pro-cyclicality of market behavior. So you -- they are -- there should be some offsetting against the 2 as well. I'm conscious of time, so if we can make questions snappy and we will try and make our responses snappy as well.\n\n---\n\nIt's Christopher Wheeler from Mediobanca. A couple of questions. The first one, just only a clarification. We've talked about that reorganization that you announced in January, and you've talked about being cost effective. You've not really talked about whether the reorganization will actually generate any cost savings on the platform. I know you've talked a lot about it being clients leaving, and I get that. I just wondered if you could give it any thoughts on what you think you can actually contribute to that cost management. That's the first question. And then just going back to what Sandy asked on the Private Banking. I'm trying to get my head around a little bit the Private Banking initiative. It sounds to me like your focus is on the high net worth segment. You have the Wealth Management, I think, focusing on the affluent segment. That's a notoriously expensive segment. Obviously, it has the high margin and also the high net worth but has pretty high cost base, generally, because of the cost of hiring financial advisers, particularly in the Asian market. I'm just wondering how you're going to manage that, whether that's partly down to, as you say, shaling [ph] some of your -- the benefits of what Wealth Management is doing. And also, I noticed you're selling the Swiss Private Bank. Does that mean you're walking away from having a Swiss booking center? Because obviously, that has been a party impact in the developing markets, and I don't know if that's losing you any kind of edge or whether you have another plan to how you might deal with that.\n\n---\n\nOkay, very quickly. On reorganization, I was quite explicit at the time we met -- we announced the reorganization that we wouldn't give any separate cost targets or whatever for that and that the reorganization should be seen as one of the ways in which we are going to achieve the things we had already said we were going to achieve, including positive jaws. The financial impact of the reorganization on 2014 will, in any case, be de minimis. The real thing it does, though, is it enables us on -- this is on the cost side of the equation, it enables us to take a fresh look at areas where we have duplication and difference between the businesses which we can harmonize and roll out standardized solutions and get a more efficient structure. There's been whole bunch of stuff on the effectiveness side, which is about focusing on segments and product groups. Very quickly, on Private Banking: I mean this is a business that -- and Wealth Management, that is high return on capital and yet, as you say, typically has a higher cost/income ratio than many \"lower return on capital\" businesses. But as the equation of banking has changed so that every business that requires capital requires lots more, that trade-off itself changes. It's also the case that the shift scale of the opportunity, as Mike outlined, around individual wealth accumulation linked to the way businesses are growing and performing in our markets is just an absolute natural opportunity for us. On Geneva, very quickly, this is just not a very good bit of our Private Banking. It's an underperforming bit of our Private Bank. We don't think we need a Geneva booking center as part of our proposition. We are not majoring on being a Swiss Private Bank. That's not why people will come to put their money with us.\n\n---\n\nIt's only around $2 billion of AUM. And we'll be offering to rebook for those customers or clients who want to come to Chelsea, London, the booking centers.\n\n---\n\nPeter may have made it as the last question, I think. So here is the mic coming to you.\n\n---\n\nPeter Toeman from HSBC. Thank you for disclosing your Pillar 2A buffer, 0.4%. I have to say, I thought it was a bit lower than one might have expected. And you've told us that, mostly, this is about pension risks. So could one infer perhaps that regulators are quite comfortable with idiosyncratic concentration risk in the loan portfolio and idiosyncratic interest rate risks that Standard might have? I mean I'm a bit surprised in the sense that I thought that, in an environment where rates are rising, the Consumer Bank would have a positive sensitivity and the Wholesale Banking [indiscernible]  to sensitivity?\n\n---\n\nYes, so the answer is -- actually, the first answer is there will be -- I've talked about this. This is always subject, as I said, to annual -- it's subject to annual PRA adjustment. It is absolutely the calculated 56% equity-treated guidance for the idiosyncratic risks of credit concentration, interest rate risk in the banking book, operational risk and pension risk. And fundamentally, all we're saying, Peter, is that, given that there is a significant pension liability for banks that have historic sizable workforces and there's a regulatory view about how that should be covered in capital, it is simply not a fact of the Standard Chartered, and that's the difference.\n\n---\n\nAnd I'm just going to say, remember, in the banking book risk, Richard's point about the short tenor of the assets also affects the banking book interest rate risks. So that's an important component as well.\n\n---\n\nI'm conscious we've used a lot of your time this morning  [indiscernible]?\n\n---\n\nA few of the sentiments have already been echoed, but I think, given it is Richard's last public appearance at a Standard Chartered forum: But you've been 11 years at Standard Chartered. For a few of the gray-haireds around here like me and yourself, it's been 15 years, nearly, since you arrived at Woolwich and started interacting with us, I think, in the sector. So I just wanted to wish you well on you way. I think the Chinese proverb of living in interesting times, as it will be a curse to live in interesting times, pretty much sums up the last few years or so. But good luck. And I think that the sentiment will be borne by all of us here to wish you on your way. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThank you very much.\n\n---\n\nShall I give a very last, final words, or you, John, if you wanted to?\n\n---\n\nI will, Peter. I'll summarize very quickly, but can I just say, thank you for the warmth you've shown towards Richard. I know how much that means to him, and thank you for doing it so spontaneously and so warmly.\r\nI hope you enjoyed the presentations today. We've got some very important messages, hopefully, across to you: 2013 was a challenging year. We were not complacent that we have moved very quickly to refocus and evolve our strategy putting in place a new organization structure, which we think will deliver value for our shareholders over the medium to long term. We have an excellent balance sheet. We think we are well capitalized. And we are confident that this is an exciting growth story which will, over time, deliver excellent returns for our shareholders.\r\nThank you for coming this morning. And hopefully, we have answered all of your questions. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text4": "【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nNow we're going to do this usual way, if you could put your hand up, wait for the mic, and when you get the mic, if you could say your name and the institution you're from. Why don't we start up front with Sandy?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sandy Chen (Analysts)】\nIt's Sandy Chen from Cenkos Securities. Just 2 questions, 1 on NPLs. The -- if you could reconcile the movement in NPLs versus the impairment allowances on Pages, I think, 39 through 43 and in particular the increase in Wholesale NPLs. And also if we can get a bit of a regional -- or sort of a country-by-country break, why is Korea going down in terms of impairment allowances and things like that. The -- and the second question is a broader question. Looking at the Commercial and Private Banking division and also wealth, the -- for Commercial and Private Banking, obviously, it's a -- it's -- Private Banking is already a well-banked proposition. I mean what's the edge that you intend to bring, probably this is a question for Alun, and that will allow you to get the customers away from existing other private banks? And also comparing the Private Bank versus the wealth proposition, I mean what are the key differences between those 2 propositions?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nWhat I'll do is I'll ask Mike to comment on the second one. And do you want to start by addressing the...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Meddings (Executives)】\n[indiscernible] the wholesale NPLs. You may work in contact with [ph] specifics [indiscernible] picture as our percentages. The NPLs in Wholesale are up 22%, 930 million up. It's a handful of accounts that have largely contributed to that. You actually look at the levels of collateral actually applied to those. It's also up equivalently around 21%. It's a level of NPLs which is wholly consistent with that which we've seen, actually, all the way back -- it's all the way back, I suppose, to 2005. I'll stop to that point. It's been around a --  it's been running at around that level over that period. As I say, there are 3 or 4 accounts in there that actually create the increase. They're predominantly in Africa where we had a couple of those, and India. With regard to India, it's offshore booked. The Africa accounts are both in commodities space, actually. One is in hard commodities, it's mining, where there were production issues in the underlying mine. And we've taken conservative provisions on that. The other, actually, is in agribusiness, the soft commodities. And we'd only provided that at the first half. We added to the provision when we looked at our collateral treatment. And I think, again, we've moved to a conservative positioning on that. So it's basically comes down to a small number of individual accounts which have gone to nonperforming in this period, but in terms of trend, it remains very consistent with the levels that we've seen over the past few years, I think.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nAnd Mike, do you want to comment on Private Banking and also the relationship between Private Banking and wealth? I mean I would just say one thing, which is one of the key differentiators we have is we already have relationships with these people. We just haven't been providing them with Private Banking services up to now. And that's why there is a logic to grouping commercial and private. But Mike, do you want to comment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alun Rees (Executives)】\nYes. Let me just pick up on a couple of thing Peter said in his presentation. So first of all, 60% of the GDP of the countries we operate in relates to medium-sized enterprises. And those are companies between $10 million, $200 million of revenue. And the other 60% is that -- 60% of the growth, world's growth, in high-net-worth individuals are going to come over the next 3 years in our market. Actually, the 2 things are linked because what's going on and through the life cycle of those companies is that their business wealth is growing and their personal wealth are growing. And so what we want to capture is the -- both the business growth wealth as those companies grow through their life cycle, but also as it splits between personal and business wealth, to start to bank them at that juncture. Our advantage is capture them at that juncture, not when they become multibillionaires and try to compete at that stage, because most of these companies are actually family-owned promoter groups, and that's the sort of heritage of Standard Chartered. And we haven't quite got that linked together before. So we've got 50,000 -- about 50,000 or 60,000 medium-sized enterprises now alongside the Private Bank. And if we can get that moment in their life cycle when that business and personal wealth starts to separate and as companies grow, that's the competitive advantage we have.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nAnd to your point about wealth and Private Banking. Wealth is going to be a product group in the same way that Financial Markets is or Corporate Finance is, and that will be supporting both the retail segment and the Private Banking segment with products. But so you have a group that is focused on a product capability and specialist sales and advice in the same way that we have done in Transaction Banking, for example. So it's a way of combining both product strength and a relationship focus.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alun Rees (Executives)】\nAnd just building on that, the one thing you know from history is, when we get focused on something, we succeed. So if you think about over the last 10 years, we started with no Corporate Finance business, we built it  to $2.5 billion of revenue. If you think about Private Banking, started in 2007, we built AUM at a 30% compound annual growth rate. So when we get focused, we get real traction, real delivery. So you look back in history, and we've succeeded where we focused.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nShould we stay on this side and just slip down? And then I'll go over to that side. So yes, whichever.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Trippitt (Analysts)】\nIt's Mike Trippitt at Numis. Two questions. On costs, as you've highlighted, 1 -- sort of 1% growth, with a lot of headwinds in terms of regulation, inflation, et cetera. Can you just give a sense of sensitivity on 2014 in terms of -- it looks like headcount has come down at the end of '13, so maybe BAU has come down, but there's inflation in there. Has investment been deferred from 2013? I'm just trying to sort of get a handle on the sensitivities on the 2014 cost base.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Meddings (Executives)】\nThe -- I mean, going in a -- the first thing to say is we are -- unsurprisingly, I think, given our comments around how we kind of see conditions, we're holding costs pretty tight. So we're gating in the -- we're holding the gate quite tight on investment release basis [ph]. But our going-in assumption for the year will be for a slight increase in headcount. I mean the budget has a 1,000 headcount increase. Our inflation assumptions are broadly the same levels as last year, again for the budget purposes, so you'd look at an underlying inflationary pressure coming in at sort of 4% to 5% again is what we have in the budgets. But as Peter said, I think it's -- the task to repeat, as we did successfully this last year and in prior years, is to achieve significant productivity benefits. And I remember, it was at the Investor Day that we showed you some of the productivity benefits we get, particularly in some of the wholesale platforms. And if I remember, FX, we had a 100 -- a 52% lift in income, plus 6% lift in underlying costs given the investment in platforms. And you see the same in Trade volumes. So I think it's about taking productivity benefits to offset pretty similar -- going-in assumptions pretty similar to that which we saw last year. We've got good investment budgets in there. In 2013, we went in with good investment budgets. We stayed pretty well with those in Wholesale. Wholesale investment was up about 11%, but we cut back on Consumer Banking investment and did less branch opening than we were going to do and focused more of our investment on digital in a number of the markets. So if that's CB and consumer, I think cut our investment spend by about 50%.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nWe'll choose, say, one more on this side, and then we'll go to that side.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rohith Chandra-Rajan (Analysts)】\nIt's Rohith Chandra-Rajan of Barclays. Two really just points of clarification, if I could, please. First, on capital. I just wanted to check what's included in the 11.2% endpoint Basel III Core Tier 1. So firstly, in terms of mitigation, the RWA reduction looks like about 20 basis points of benefit. Just wanted to check that and also get your indication of what the derivatives clearing, centralized clearing on derivatives, would be. And then secondly, just in terms of some of the regulatory change headwinds. You talked, at the time of the pre-close, about 20 to 40 basis points from large corporate exposures. I don't know if that's in that 11.2% or not, or if that's part of the 30 to 50 you expect this year. And also, the 30 basis point dividend impact, which is a timing difference, again, is that in the number, or is it part of the expectation for this year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Meddings (Executives)】\nLet me try and help. So on the -- we have -- the foreseeable dividends is not included in there. We made a comment in the press release that, assuming our normal scrip assumption, how much, it's around 25% [ph], I think, the foreseeable dividend's one-step adjustment, if required, is around 30 basis points. So you take that off the 11.2% endpoint, which will take you to 10.9% for that. On the last point you raised, in terms of models, one of the reasons we came in, I think, higher than most of you expected, I think, on the ratio at 10.9% is that we had talked to you about a real expectation of a model adjustment coming through on EAD. And that really is adjusting the pay factor, which is the momentum, the momentum factor attaching to corporates headroom and limits. And I think it was an adjustment to the momentum component. We think that's about a 30 basis point model adjustment. That is at the bottom, therefore, of the range we were indicating for '14. We think that is going to come in. We think it's likely to come in, in this first half. It will probably have impact on other banks, I don't know the extent to which it is the same impact on other banks. Staying with that theme, if I might: On the models, we've said we think 30 to 50. The other 2 main components of potential models are essentially loan portfolios, predominantly in corporate, but also FI. There's a very large component which is potentially the unsecured LGD requirement on unsecured FI exposures. We honestly don't know where that's coming in. We would step back, from a policy perspective, Peter spoke about this, and argue that perhaps it isn't very sensible to put a 45% LGD on unsecured FI exposures, which is what happens through interbank. So I don't know whether that comes in or not. And then there are some mitigations that we're expecting. There are some mid-corporate PD adjustments and some CAD 2 on FX and there is some CAD 2 on equities. Those elements net out to a 30 to 50 basis points. If we don't get the LGD adjustments, it's quite possible that the EAD of 30 will be lower by getting some of the mitigants. So our best estimate today is this 30 to 50 basis points of model adjustment. There's probably a lot more that you...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nThere's a little bit of mitigation and...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Meddings (Executives)】\nAh, yes, so the mitigations. So if you get to transitional, we've got CVA and AVC. So CVA and AVC are $8 billion and $5.5 billion. There's also another $2 billion or so coming through from some RWA threshold adjustments. We have got some mitigation to those, which is about $6.4 billion. And the current regulations basically in our options businesses, particularly, for us, FX, commodities and currencies. And to bite through, you are required to risk-weight them gross, in other words, without a line to offset. So you actually take RWA on each of the options disconnected Basel III, allows you to offset, which is where we manage the book and actually the way actually the business runs. So you'll get about a $6.4 billion, $6.3 billion offset predominantly as you net-off options which are matched in terms of both economic and financial management. You bring those down and there's about a $9 billion, I think, of risk-weighted increase at the transitional level. You then adjust that for mitigation, which is an internal management methodology. And you've got moved to central clearing, that's about $6 billion. And then I'll do the capital if you want, but you probably have had enough. So...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nI mean, just going back [indiscernible]. I mean the picture you should take away is there are a lot of things that could -- are still unfolding in terms of the capital picture. And some of them are perfectly sensible changes that the regulators are putting in place, some we think are more questionable. Firstly, I don't really see the logic of the foreseeable dividends thing because it is a subsequent decision and just to key management lever. If you were under pressure on capital, you would act on your dividend. You -- so to sort of make it automatic and built-in seems to me like kind of a curious thing to do, but...\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Peace (Executives)】\nYou missed that. You just put a sign and saying, \"We'll miss you...\"\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nBut the -- there's a -- given all that, what's important is that we are at a very strong starting point with a significant buffer over the things we know we have to meet and we are managing for capital accretion. Right, should we go over this side? Ah, that's -- what's his name again?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Peace (Executives)】\nYou can never remember?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nTom.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Rayner (Analysts)】\nIt's Michael Adrian -- Tom, Tom Rayner from Exane BNP Paribas. Just to stay on the same theme: I mean there were 2 surprises from my point of view, on RWAs in the results: firstly, the sort of extent of the slowdown in the second half, this is just on a Basel II basis; and then secondly, the small impact of moving to CRD IV endpoint. So I have questions on both of those. On the first, I mean how exactly have you achieved that sort of slowdown in the second half? Is it sustainable? And could you talk about the impacts on revenue, profits and returns going forward, and the sort of measures you've taken and whether they continue? And then on -- secondly and coming sort of Rohith's point on mitigation, I'm assuming this is mitigation that you've not yet put into place. And the dividend issue as well is something -- may not be sensible but it's something which is -- it looks like it's happening. So I would look at your 11.2% on an endpoint and I take off the 40 for the dividend and the 20 for the mitigation and say you're really at 10.6%, which is still not bad versus 8.4%. So then I'd look at your 8.4% and say, well, there's lots of other things here that are going to get added on. Countercyclical, sectoral add-ons going to get you to 9.5%, 10%. You're going to have to run with 1% above that as a sensible management sort of position. So I think go to -- you're looking at 11% versus 10.6% today, which again isn't disastrous, but I think it does mean that your whole management of RWAs versus dividends is a little bit more tricky than you're kind of suggesting. So I just wondered if you could comment on all of those things, please, just to sort of wrap it up.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nWell, why don't we start with the specific issue around the slowing of the growth of RWA in the second half of last year, and because most of the action was in the Wholesale Banking business? Mike, why don't you comment on all the actions we have taken there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alun Rees (Executives)】\nOkay. If you go back to the Investor Day, you'll remember we talked about specific things we were doing to get returns up and grow revenue. One was the top -- the next 500 clients, but we also talked about the suboptimal clients as well. And we talked about the progress we've made. And what we did was turned up the heat on that. So in the back end of the year, as Richard alluded to earlier, we got about a $3 billion save out of suboptimal clients, which in addition to that, we also got a 12 -- 14 basis points uplift on the return on those clients as well. So that was the predominant lever we pulled to really intensify our focus on those suboptimal clients. And that will roll into this year. We're targeting around about another $10 billion of RWAs saves from this year. The one thing I'd caution you is, don't build all that into your models because your other point was very valid as well, which is clearly we're going to start with the easy ones to do, and the ones which have more income impact, we'd leave for later. So we will be redeploying some of that $10 billion of savings into high-yielding assets to mitigate the income drag of that save. So it's a very intensive program we're running, and we told you about at the investment day, and that was the large piece of the lever we pulled towards the year end. And it's continuing to this year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nThe boarder comment on...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Meddings (Executives)】\nAll right. Yes, I think it's going to be a subject of a broader discussion between us, actually, because I think that the fundamental thrust of what we're trying to make sure people understand, and I know you do, is that point about it's a surplus over the requirement that matters in a world where the regulatory world is no longer a common threshold for banks. The idea of the common threshold stops at the 4.5%, and then you start getting differences. It was even the 2.5% is where the Pillar 2B buffer gets assessed. So every buffer that goes over the 4.5% is bespoke. And the important thing is to what extent are you above that requirement. To your numbers, 11.2%, adjust for the dividend, I think that's 30. You could say 40 if we're  getting a scrip. We've never not had scrip. It's a reasonable assumption, I think. So I think 30 to 10.9%. And yes, there will be model adjustments. Either take it down to 10.5%, 10.6%. Add 15 basis points, 10 to 15 basis points, for the current disposal by the end of this year, listen to our language about risk-weight efficiencies, another $10 billion taken out this year out of Wholesale and redeployed to higher return. But $10 billion will be the -- will be a reduction from our base load expectations. And we're going to continue to manage well. In terms of the surprise, I don't -- I never wanted to surprise you. We -- it really is fundamentally the fact that, the EAD model, we had fully expected it to bite by the end of -- in the second half of last year. And then there was some RWA efficiency, I think it would have been around 20 basis points higher than we had thought for those I'll call them more organic management of risk weight, as Mike has talked to. But then, Tom, it does come back to, one, we're accretive, fifth metric. We're committing to that. Two, we've got disposals. Three, we've got the risk-weight discipline. Fourthly, it's about the surplus. And that surplus, you see, you have to do -- if you say it's about 11% of charge, there's a risk that you fall into, I think, the old, the similar misconception, trying to set some sort of threshold. The way to test yourself on the threshold is to do the capital stacks with our peers and then say, \"Okay, Standard Chartered, if you're at 11%, what do I know that, that means other banks have got to be traveling at as a minimum?\" And are you asking for that? And more important, as the regulators look, they can see our capital stack of 8.4%. It informs their target guidance for us. And just to reassert it because I think it is very important to understand this, we are quite significant -- we are materially ahead of the target capital ratio that the PRA is guiding us to achieve by 2019.  Today we are significantly and materially ahead of it. So...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Rayner (Analysts)】\nAnd Peter, maybe just -- could I just pin you down on your 2014 priority? When you say profitable and capital-accretive growth, what exactly...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Meddings (Executives)】\nWe're talking again with organic. We're talking against organic. It is very...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Rayner (Analysts)】\nWhat exactly does that mean? Does that mean the ROE and the CET 1 ratio are both going to rise this year? Is that a good way of interpreting that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Meddings (Executives)】\nNo. What we're saying is that, in that financial framework, we've added, for the steering of the group, a fifth metric. We also said, when we introduced it, you won't see us beat -- get a good beat on that metric when you're getting a step-in one-off adjustment. So for instance, you get full model hit of 50 basis points, that's quite a difficult increment to get past in terms of organic growth. And nor would you expect it, nor would you want us, I suspect, to try and grow to do that. But against the organic growth of the business, we are going to be managing it at a return for that business on a way that is capital accretive, but we won't in one reporting period. We are also to absorb one-off step changes from a singular model arrival.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nAnd the way you should look at the priorities is basically the comfort as to the signals by sounding we're the organization as to what we want the business to achieve. These are priorities that we cascade internally. And they're all about the emphasis we're putting on returns, on capital accretion, on very disciplined growth. Growth in its own right is not good enough, it needs to be profitable and capital accretive. And that -- this isn't just something that we articulate at the board level or the Finance Director or whatever, it's something that we're driving through the disciplines of the business. Michael, in front.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Helsby (Analysts)】\nIt's Michael Helsby from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. I've got 3 quick questions. Firstly, just going back to this Wholesale NPL, Richard. You explained Africa, I think, which makes sense. I think the big chunk was in offshore. And there's about $0.5 billion of higher NPLs. And actually, the bad debt provision went down, and it was only very, very small to start off with, so -- and then if you could just explain, because that looks very specific, some things are very notable going on there. Second question is in Korea. I think, Peter, you stressed there will be another drag, which I think you told us before about in Korea, in 2014. I think the drag was 13 million PBT-wise. Can you size the drag? I know that's hard, but if you can give us a ballpark, that will be helpful. And then finally, just to go back to what Bob was saying over the -- sorry, Tom. The -- I'm just trying to square the circle, which is that your -- to use your words, you're materially above the minimum capital requirement. The -- so I'm just trying to square the circle on the dividend policy, the fifth metric, and the -- and that very strong capital position that you've got. So if earnings are -- growth is 0 in 2014, I know that's not what you're suggesting, but if they were, would that mean dividends are flat in 2014? So is it the dividend that you are going to flex?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nCan I take the last one first? Which is we fully understand the importance to shareholders as -- of a progressive dividend policy. We have multiple levers we can pull in terms of driving capital accretion. And it depends on the scenario and precisely how you get to that scenario, which levers that are the most attractive ones to pull, but we are showing you that we are actively pulling 2 levers in particular at the moment. One is extension of RWA or pulling back on RWA to low-returning clients. And two is disposal of businesses that aren't either strategically aligned or performing. And three is taking action on businesses that aren't giving us good returns. So it isn't the case. The dividend is the only lever that we have to pull and it's a lever that we would be extremely thoughtful about pulling.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Helsby (Analysts)】\n[indiscernible] dividend flat on the second half of last year. Those are -- yes, you did pull the lever on dividend this year...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nYes, if you do the math, that's not a realistic -- that's not a -- it doesn't make any difference at all to our capital ratios to make very small changes in any 1 year to the percentage of the dividend. So I mean if we were using that as a lever, it's not a very useful lever...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Helsby (Analysts)】\nIt's a big signaling...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nThe signal that you should take is our demonstrable record of paying increasing dividends, which we have done for a very long time. Second, I'll do Korea, and then I'll hand it back to you on the NPL in U.K. On -- look, I'm not going to give you a precise number on where we're going to end up on Korea. There's a lot of moving parts where a lot of it depends on things like our success in derisking the unsecured portfolio. We would anticipate loan impairment falling in the second half of the year, but there's a lot of external factors that drive this. What we're certainly not expecting -- when you think about it in terms of P&L drag, what we're not expecting is the same negative delta of $527 million that we experienced in 2013. But we are saying, look, we can't do all the things we want to do as fast as we would like, so it's not a quick fix. We know what we're trying to do. So this year will continue to be pretty difficult. Do you want a pick up on...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Meddings (Executives)】\nOn the -- I think you can see it in the OBU [ph] in the U.K. segment. And fundamentally, if you look at the U.K. segment, it's not just one account, it's a number of accounts. But this -- a majority of the increase is predominantly on one account, and it's an account held at fair values. It's predominantly a stick position there for whole fair value through the trading book. We've taken a negative income discount on that amount -- on that -- sorry, on that exposure as we fair-valued it through the..\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Helsby (Analysts)】\nSo it's $0.5 billion...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Meddings (Executives)】\nIt's not. There's an increase in the U.K. segment of about that amount. It is not $0.5 billion. But the majority of the increase in the geography is one account. The rest of it obviously is in other accounts. And we're comfortable with where they are.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nShould we go here, [indiscernible]? So I'm just conscious of giving...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chintan Joshi (Analysts)】\nChintan Joshi here from Nomura. 2 questions and 1 quick follow-up. Your outlook comments of modest growth for 2014. Could you just elaborate what do you mean modest for revenues, volumes? It would be helpful. Second, can you set some expectations for Trade or Transaction Banking for 2014? What have you seen in the initial months of this year on kind of margins, volumes, and what you have in your plans? And the clarification was, you said you'll reduce RWAs by about $10 billion and reinvest them in high-yielding assets. What are we talking about when you mean high-yielding assets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Meddings (Executives)】\nThe last one just real clearly is similar customer. So it's not the same customers but customers who allow us essentially to cross-sell or upsell. It's not a cross to an investment portfolio. It's actually, as we look at the customers, if it's Trade, then we'll sell in Trade, which is a low-return business, actually. Trade works if we get the upsell. If we don't get the upsell, actually, why are we putting our balance sheet there? And so removing those risk weights to those customers who will give us, who will buy from us the other risk management products that are attached. It's not getting a cross-reinvestment...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nAnd do you, Mike, want to just comment on Trade and cash as the main components of Transaction Banking?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alun Rees (Executives)】\nSo throughout last year, I mean the core element, despite the challenging markets, was stay close to our strategy. And our strategy was about staying close to our clients. And I go back to the point Peter made earlier about the disconnect between what's going on in GDP growth and what's going on in Financial Markets. And you can see that in 2 halves of our P&L. So our client volumes, our client business grew pretty well. I mean, even FM, which in the market is challenged, was up 7% on client income, but underpinning that is we're staying close to our clients. And they were seeing GDP growth, was -- our volumes were up. So what we're seeing this year on the volume side is a continuation of the theme. What we're seeing on the margin side is, particularly on Trade, margins are stabilizing. They wobble around a bit depending on here and there, but Chinese banks are paying up in the dollar market at the moment, you see that reflecting through the Trade front. But overall, margins are stabilizing and we're continuing to get the volume growth.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Meddings (Executives)】\nIt's quite, I mean, right [ph]. I mean so we had -- the margins went up about 115 basis points. We have seen the growth of Trade, they're broadly stabilized around that level of capital. In the markets, we're seeing margins up, actually. So there's an upwards direction on [indiscernible]. In terms of Trade margins, Singapore. So that's the Chinese -- only Chinese impact. But elsewhere, there's some still slight decline and the overall picture for our margins in Trade are currently flat. Volumes are up on last year for the start of the year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nAnd as for modest growth, it's a deliberately expensive phrase because there's a lot of uncertainty, it's very early in the year. But we do anticipate that, broadly speaking, the business will grow, will see modest growth.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Manus Costello (Analysts)】\nIt's Manus Costello from Autonomous. I've just got a question about the structure of your balance sheet. If I look at your Americas, U.K., Europe division, which has always been an enigma, but it's grown its share of deposits. From a percent of the group deposits, it's grown by more than 100 basis points. This year, it's grown by about 5% since precrisis. And so my questions are, has that happened as a result of a deliberate strategy? Or is it just because people have been parking deposits with you as a safe international institution over the last few years? And following on from that, as the West recovers, as rates rise, as people maybe find other places to park their deposits, how is that going to impact your growth and your margins over the next few years if you don't have that source of liquidity?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Meddings (Executives)】\nSo it's -- I mean it's probably regulatory driven, actually. It's where, as you look at an international group, you want to leave your -- you want your deposits placed. So it's partly trade with regulatory influence, particularly in Americas and U.K. And that -- so that is the main driver. And then actually, if you look at the rate of increase generally across the balance sheet, it won't be that far out, if you adjust for that factor, than elsewhere. So increasingly, we are holding levels of liquidity in our home market and in our core clearing market. And there are regulatory requirements, if you're going to be significantly unclear about the -- around liquidity balances you hold against that business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nShall we go right? Chris?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Manners (Analysts)】\nIt's Chris Manners from Morgan Stanley. I had 2 questions for you. So the first one was just on competitiveness of the Standard Chartered in the sort of high-capital world. It does look like at least the PRA is putting some super equivalents on yourselves versus where your international peers are. How are you able to price competitively if you need to hold high capital? And how do you think about that competitiveness point? And the second one was just on pro-cyclicality of risk-weighted assets. Obviously, Asian defaults have been very low over recent years. They're starting to pick up. Do you think that a pickup in Asian defaults will cause some credit migration, which would then inform higher risk weights? And also, you see things like the HKMA jacking up risk-weighted sort of mortgages. Have you got any other areas where you can see sort of countercyclical measures that may push up your risk ratings?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nDo you want to do pro-cyclicality? On the broader sort of competitiveness implications of sort of different capital requirements in different places, I mean this is part of the reference I made to sort of interpretations in unilateral initiatives. One of the concerns I have about the way the whole sort of Basel III thing is actually being translated into reality is there are a lot of different flavors. And that does have competitive implications. It isn't all one way though. If you look at some of our local bank competitors, actually, they operate at quite high levels of core equity. The accounting potential standards vary from market to market, so it's not a uniform picture. I mean I think the only answer I can give to that is we see huge merit in getting greater standardization across these kinds of metrics. And competition is not going to be completely driven on the price of your balance sheet. If it were, we wouldn't have been able to win as much market share as we have demonstrably done over the last few years. It's also driven by the quality of products and services and the way you build the relationship.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alun Rees (Executives)】\nI think, in going forward, you should also think about competitiveness not only just in terms of capital models against liquidity, but also conduct of business. So you look at how things like the Volcker rule and look at how CFTC rules are affecting some of the global banks now and what they can do and who they can do business with, it's getting more and more complex. And I think, that upheld, we just think it's about capital liquidity. It's about a whole broader range of measures coming out through conduct of business regulation as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nAnd generally speaking, as an international bank operating in lots of other jurisdictions against competition from local banks, we -- our starting assumption is that the playing field is tilted against us. I mean that's -- yes, that's our operating assumption. So [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Meddings (Executives)】\nLook, so I'll just pick on some of the specifics. I mean I think the HKMA is an interesting point. I -- they have increased the floor essentially, increased the risk rate on mortgages. They didn't do it for historic book, they brought it in for new bookings and contrast that with the Scandinavian region. So it's not just in Asian markets that you've got potential lift to underlying risk rate. In terms of, again, the book, I think, it -- remember a short tenor. So as you reflect on the fact that 64% of the wholesale business is short tenor, largely trade, it reprices. It reprices, actually, to reflect risk. It reprices to reflect capital, services. And that we sit there with a 10-year bullet structure and just watch see what happens. Actually, we are moving with the markets in terms of making our facilities available to our clients and pricing for the risk accordingly. This year, we had a $9 billion negative credit migration. You'll see in the actual numbers. An element of that, actually, was for the change in policy that we had. We changed policy around treatment to parental support [ph] and how we applied that, and that caused some increase. Our historic long run -- our long-run rates of credit migration are around $3 billion. This year, going into '14, we've got our assumption of between $5 billion and $6 billion for negative credit migration. We clearly take it into significant account. And when we run stress tests, it's part of all the scenarios that we run in terms of what happens in stresses to the underlying risk weight as essentially for default probabilities movement. So I think we are all over the point. Remember, the balance sheet is short tenor. Remember, it's not just Asia. Actually, where you've got regulatory -- not interference, regulatory adjustments to mortgage floors, as your example. And we've gone into this year with a very substantial, I think, assumption within our planning around negative credit migration.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nOne of the other issues also, Chris, is that -- which I know that the regulators are thinking about and debating through this atmosphere and so on, is the interplay between our pro-cyclicality in the RWA measures and the kind of cyclical buffer because, actually, the 2 should operate in opposite directions, right, because otherwise, they're both trying to do the same thing. And the one thing that they are very keen to avoid is having the regulatory system exacerbate the natural pro-cyclicality of market behavior. So you -- they are -- there should be some offsetting against the 2 as well. I'm conscious of time, so if we can make questions snappy and we will try and make our responses snappy as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Wheeler (Analysts)】\nIt's Christopher Wheeler from Mediobanca. A couple of questions. The first one, just only a clarification. We've talked about that reorganization that you announced in January, and you've talked about being cost effective. You've not really talked about whether the reorganization will actually generate any cost savings on the platform. I know you've talked a lot about it being clients leaving, and I get that. I just wondered if you could give it any thoughts on what you think you can actually contribute to that cost management. That's the first question. And then just going back to what Sandy asked on the Private Banking. I'm trying to get my head around a little bit the Private Banking initiative. It sounds to me like your focus is on the high net worth segment. You have the Wealth Management, I think, focusing on the affluent segment. That's a notoriously expensive segment. Obviously, it has the high margin and also the high net worth but has pretty high cost base, generally, because of the cost of hiring financial advisers, particularly in the Asian market. I'm just wondering how you're going to manage that, whether that's partly down to, as you say, shaling [ph] some of your -- the benefits of what Wealth Management is doing. And also, I noticed you're selling the Swiss Private Bank. Does that mean you're walking away from having a Swiss booking center? Because obviously, that has been a party impact in the developing markets, and I don't know if that's losing you any kind of edge or whether you have another plan to how you might deal with that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nOkay, very quickly. On reorganization, I was quite explicit at the time we met -- we announced the reorganization that we wouldn't give any separate cost targets or whatever for that and that the reorganization should be seen as one of the ways in which we are going to achieve the things we had already said we were going to achieve, including positive jaws. The financial impact of the reorganization on 2014 will, in any case, be de minimis. The real thing it does, though, is it enables us on -- this is on the cost side of the equation, it enables us to take a fresh look at areas where we have duplication and difference between the businesses which we can harmonize and roll out standardized solutions and get a more efficient structure. There's been whole bunch of stuff on the effectiveness side, which is about focusing on segments and product groups. Very quickly, on Private Banking: I mean this is a business that -- and Wealth Management, that is high return on capital and yet, as you say, typically has a higher cost/income ratio than many \"lower return on capital\" businesses. But as the equation of banking has changed so that every business that requires capital requires lots more, that trade-off itself changes. It's also the case that the shift scale of the opportunity, as Mike outlined, around individual wealth accumulation linked to the way businesses are growing and performing in our markets is just an absolute natural opportunity for us. On Geneva, very quickly, this is just not a very good bit of our Private Banking. It's an underperforming bit of our Private Bank. We don't think we need a Geneva booking center as part of our proposition. We are not majoring on being a Swiss Private Bank. That's not why people will come to put their money with us.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Meddings (Executives)】\nIt's only around $2 billion of AUM. And we'll be offering to rebook for those customers or clients who want to come to Chelsea, London, the booking centers.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nPeter may have made it as the last question, I think. So here is the mic coming to you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Toeman (Analysts)】\nPeter Toeman from HSBC. Thank you for disclosing your Pillar 2A buffer, 0.4%. I have to say, I thought it was a bit lower than one might have expected. And you've told us that, mostly, this is about pension risks. So could one infer perhaps that regulators are quite comfortable with idiosyncratic concentration risk in the loan portfolio and idiosyncratic interest rate risks that Standard might have? I mean I'm a bit surprised in the sense that I thought that, in an environment where rates are rising, the Consumer Bank would have a positive sensitivity and the Wholesale Banking [indiscernible]  to sensitivity?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Meddings (Executives)】\nYes, so the answer is -- actually, the first answer is there will be -- I've talked about this. This is always subject, as I said, to annual -- it's subject to annual PRA adjustment. It is absolutely the calculated 56% equity-treated guidance for the idiosyncratic risks of credit concentration, interest rate risk in the banking book, operational risk and pension risk. And fundamentally, all we're saying, Peter, is that, given that there is a significant pension liability for banks that have historic sizable workforces and there's a regulatory view about how that should be covered in capital, it is simply not a fact of the Standard Chartered, and that's the difference.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alun Rees (Executives)】\nAnd I'm just going to say, remember, in the banking book risk, Richard's point about the short tenor of the assets also affects the banking book interest rate risks. So that's an important component as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nI'm conscious we've used a lot of your time this morning  [indiscernible]?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Rayner (Analysts)】\nA few of the sentiments have already been echoed, but I think, given it is Richard's last public appearance at a Standard Chartered forum: But you've been 11 years at Standard Chartered. For a few of the gray-haireds around here like me and yourself, it's been 15 years, nearly, since you arrived at Woolwich and started interacting with us, I think, in the sector. So I just wanted to wish you well on you way. I think the Chinese proverb of living in interesting times, as it will be a curse to live in interesting times, pretty much sums up the last few years or so. But good luck. And I think that the sentiment will be borne by all of us here to wish you on your way. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Meddings (Executives)】\nThank you very much.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nShall I give a very last, final words, or you, John, if you wanted to?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Peace (Executives)】\nI will, Peter. I'll summarize very quickly, but can I just say, thank you for the warmth you've shown towards Richard. I know how much that means to him, and thank you for doing it so spontaneously and so warmly.\r\nI hope you enjoyed the presentations today. We've got some very important messages, hopefully, across to you: 2013 was a challenging year. We were not complacent that we have moved very quickly to refocus and evolve our strategy putting in place a new organization structure, which we think will deliver value for our shareholders over the medium to long term. We have an excellent balance sheet. We think we are well capitalized. And we are confident that this is an exciting growth story which will, over time, deliver excellent returns for our shareholders.\r\nThank you for coming this morning. And hopefully, we have answered all of your questions. Thank you.",

      "transcript_text1": "Good morning, and welcome to our full year 2013 results presentation. Prudential has delivered a strong performance in 2013 with double-digit growth across all our key performance metrics. We are pleased to announce that we have achieved all 6 of our 2013 'Growth and Cash' objectives. As you know, we've been early in talking about cash, and we have been focusing on that metric since 2008. From a situation of great dependency on the U.K. in terms of cash and earnings in 2007, we are now in a position where each of our 4 businesses is materially cash generative. We have also been able in parallel to generate I believe more growth than any other large-cap insurance company. So we have not only talked about 'Growth and Cash', we have been able to deliver on that promise. And in the end, it is this delivery only that matters. People sometimes are kind enough to refer to the quality of our strategy. I actually think that what is really unique about this company and its team is our focus on execution and our ability to deliver consistently. A few weeks ago at investor seminar, the motto was more of the same. This remains our motto with a little twist this morning, which is more of the same, just better. The renewal announced this morning of our strategic bancassurance agreement with Standard Chartered Bank is a good example of that, more of the same, just better. The previous agreement was already a good one. In the past 15 years, our sales from this partnership have grown by 160x. The new agreement is a clear improvement on the previous one. It is longer, it is deeper and it is broader than the previous agreement. It is longer, this new agreement will run for 15 years -- where's Greg. So Greg, we don't have -- to have this banter, when does it end anymore. 15 years, I can finally take that question with a smile. 2029 it's been going on for a long -- and thank you for your patience, Greg. You've been really -- he has been really good.\n\n---\n\nThis is the point, of course.\n\n---\n\nI know. I'm trying to buy some goodwill here. I know my time will come. It's very transparent. So it's a longer agreement. It's broader. It gives us access to 11 markets in Asia, and it secures exclusive rights to discuss bancassurance agreements in 7 additional markets in the near future. It's also deeper because in a number of markets, we are strengthening our existing relationship as we move to either exclusive or preferred terms. And last but not least, as part of the agreement, we will work with SCB to explore some of the huge opportunities available to us in Africa. Our teams know and respect each other. They work very well together as evidenced by the growth of our business over the last 15 years, I've said 160x. That is why we are confident that this new agreement giving us unfettered access to one of the best banking franchises in Asia, about 800 branches in the new agreement, is a milestone in our development. With that, I will follow today my usual format. I will start with the highlight of our full year results and then, we'll comment on a few key aspects of our strategy. As usual, there will be a focus on Asia, but we will also cover Jackson and our businesses in the U.K., the life businesses and M&G. I will then hand over then to Nic, who'll cover our financial performance in more detail. And I will come back at the end to talk about the outlook for rest of the year and beyond, and we will then take your questions. As always, the executive team from across the group are here and they will do their best to answer any questions you may have. And I'm sure we'll have opportunities to intervene.\r\nSo back to 2013. IFRS operating profit grew 17% to GBP 2.954 million (sic) [GBP 2.954 billion], we wanted to reach GBP 3 billion, but we stopped a bit short of that, but GBP 2.954 billion. We've often talked about doubling in 4 years for Asia, well we have actually been able to double the entire group in 4 years. We've gone from GBP 1.4 billion in '09 to close to GBP 3 billion in '13. New business profits grew by 16% to over GBP 2.8 billion, and we win that Asia has achieved the last remaining 2013 objective, you've heard me many times saying it was the most challenging. I believe it was. So it's been the last one in time to be achieved. And we're pleased it was achieved with doubling the NBP to GBP 1.46 billion in spite of significant effects of headwinds, so it's good performance. Now importantly, these earnings have been converted into cash and our key measure of cash generation, free surplus generation, is up by 18% to almost GBP 2.5 billion with, again, material contributions for more business units, and I'll come back to that. Our capital position remains strong. And as we promised, that's another long running debate between us. We have today published for the first time our recurring capital ratio, which is 257% for 2013. Nic will give you much more detail on this in his presentation. And our IGD solvency 1 surplus capital remains unchanged, GBP 5.1 billion. It is this continuing strong operating and financial performance and robust capital position of the group that have enabled the board to re-base our dividend upwards by 15% to 33.57 pence. So in a nutshell, these results demonstrate that the group has been able to deliver on its promise of generating both growth and cash.\r\nBack to the objective we have achieved now all 6 of our objectives. In that process, the financial characteristics of the group have been transformed, and all businesses are now remitting significant amounts of cash and PCA Asia delivered over GBP 1 billion of IFRS operating profit. You'll all familiar with this slide by now. We viewed this many times, but it shows you also the change of scale that has been achieved in that period. Asia has more than doubled in the top there, both NBP and IFRS in 4 years. Asia's cash remittance has increased 10x. Jackson's net remittance has increased more than 7x. And the U.K. has continued to generate large amounts of cash in a challenging contest. So we tried to capture on 1 page then, some of the key developments of 2013. So as always, we'll start by talking about our customers. Our progress in Asia has allowed us to acquire 1.9 million new customers in 2013. I was in Hong Kong last week with Barry, and we did the calculation in our idle time. And we came down, if you take a 24/7 basis to 1 policy every 10 seconds in Asia. Assuming we work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. So I've given the new challenge to Barry, which is to beat Usain Bolt and break the 10-second barrier. We need to go to 1 every 8 seconds or something like that, even better. We have extended -- thank you. Our distribution reach in Asia, we have a new agreement with Standard Chartered, I've just described. We have conducted the integration of Thanachart in very fast times. Sold our first policy in May, the first day after receiving regulatory approval. And our new Thai business as you'll see later is already making a material contribution to our profits. Across our  bancassurance relationships to give you number, NBP in our sweet spot markets grew by 23% in the year, a pleasing result. We have also achieved the long running ambition of the group by domesticating our REITs profits business in Hong Kong, separating the U.K. REIT profit from the Hong Kong REIT profit from. We have entered new markets in Asia. We have launched in Cambodia in February, or January? February?\n\n---\n\nJanuary.\n\n---\n\nJanuary 2013. And we've opened now a representative office in Myanmar. Moving from Asia to the U.S., we have continued to innovate as demonstrated by the success of Elite Access, which generated $4 billion of premiums in 2013, triple the level achieved 1 year before. The REALIC acquisition we announced in May 2012 has been successfully integrated, and you can see its contribution to its numbers. It's been delivering above the expected benefits and has contributed to enhancing and diversifying our revenue stream in the U.S. In asset management, we've continued to expand M&G's presence in Europe, driving European retail funds under management up 64% to GBP 24 billion. And in addition to our well-known portfolio, PCA, Jackson, U.K. Life, M&G, we have entered Africa for a small acquisition in Ghana. We also played an integral part in reaching an agreement with regulators and politicians in November last year on Omnibus II, directive of Solvency II. This agreement provides more clarity, we believe, to you our investors on the capital indications of the new regime. And also ensures that we insurers can continue to play our role in financing the long-term capital needs of the economy. Now this chart for us is just the translation in financial terms of all these actions we have conducted since 2008. And I think every year has been at least as busy as 2013, when you list everything that's been done. 2013 adds 1 more year to our track record built now over several years. And refers to bars on the left, we've let them on this chart because they're interesting. They're empty because we only started measuring our sources of earnings in 2008, and those of you who were in this presentation at the time so at the half year of '08, these results being presented for the first time. And what gets measured, gets managed. We all know that. So since then, our focus on driving growth and fee income and insurance margin has delivered growing scale with improved quality with 31 CAGR for almost 2 categories together, over 5 years. And they've moved from 38% of our earnings from 63% in the total, but itself has more than doubled. So it's been really a very important part of the strategy. In more simplistic terms, just looking at cash, cash straightforward from being highly dependent on the U.K. in '08, which you can see here and even more in '09, the U.K. in '08 was contributing 40% of the group's remittances. We are now better balanced, well diversified group with material contributions from all our 4 business units, something we told you we wanted to achieve. It is hard to overstate the importance of this transformation from a group. Probably, we are able to run it. For our options in terms of profitable growth and investments, I mean those Standard Chartered deal based on internal resources, as well as for cash rewards over time for shareholders. Now achieving the 2017 objectives, of course, represents an important milestone for the company. However, you know us, we never want to be complacent and it is a luxury, sadly, that we cannot afford. I wish we could. As announced, at the investor conference in December, we have set ourselves new and challenging objectives that underline the scale of our continued ambition for this group. We are essentially looking to double Asia from this already larger and higher base is while also aiming to generate cash equivalent to 1/3 of the current market capital of the group. Now of course, we have not given you the balance for '14, '15, '16 because we do not want to forecast the shape of our trajectory. But these will be 4 additional years of hard work, and we are confident that we will get there by 2017, above GBP 1 billion of free surplus generation in Asia, set between GBP 900 million and GBP 1.1 billion. GBP 1.8 billion of IFRS profit and GBP 10 billion of cumulative group free surplus generation over 4 years after funding significant growth.\r\nNow of course, a key consideration when we're looking ahead towards 2017, is the macroeconomic context. We actually believe that the macroeconomic environment today has become more supportive for our group. And actually, largely validates our geographic focus. With the stream of positive economic news that we have recently received in the U.S. and U.K. are good news for our businesses there. Today I was reading, this morning WACD is now at 3.3 for the U.K. So it's all positive. And put simply, if you think about financial risks at Prudential, it is mostly sitting in Jackson and in U.K., and as the U.S. and the U.K. economies continue to recover and as long-term interest rates rise, accordingly, there will be a strong beneficial impact on both the profits of our businesses and their capital strength in the U.S. and in the U.K.\r\nNow moving onto Asia. Of course, some of the currency weakness that we have seen in a few select Asian countries following the Federal Reserve's tapering of quantitative easing will impact our reported financial in 2014, and Nic will provide you a sense of that impact looking at 2013 on spot rates. We'll give you the sensitivities. But looking through here, this ultimate is very small number of high-level comment, which I believe are important. In each country, we must keep in mind that we are fundamentally in local currency. And we have, so to speak, no cross-currency exposure in the business model. When we face the market, we're not a car manufacturer -- manufacturing from a high base country, high-cost country, having to sell into the Indonesian market. We do not import any raw materials. All our inputs and our outputs are local. Our assets and liabilities are matched in local currency. So clearly, the only and the main FX exposure, as we'll know is non-economic. It is purely a translation exposure. The Vietnamese dong, those rupiahs we're collecting, they're sitting there in our coffers. Okay? The only thing that changes is how many pounds that represents. And what matter as in the long-term business that covers is actually the rupiahs and the dongs that we're collecting and the economic fundamentals in those countries. And we believe these are sound in our sweet spot countries, and we have evidence to support that. In effect, growth has proven resilient in our sweet spot countries and on the ground businesses in all these countries are doing well. As a result on a local currency basis, we continue to grow strongly. And all of you remains that over the medium to long-term, currency values are highly correlated with GDP growth. So we are happy to be predominantly in a part of the world that grows faster than the rest of the world. That is the long-term positive of this stuff. Because clearly, Asia continues to be the main driver of global growth. It's, of course, the long-running debate around whether China will grow at 6.5%, 7% 7.5%. A bit marginal difference in China is GDP growth will not matter too much for Prudential, and we have much more data to show you why. And the relatively negative sentiment vis-à-vis Asia that prevails in financial markets today seems to us to be somewhat disconnected from the drivers of the real economies that we see locally via our businesses. Now within this context, what really matters the most to us and to our story is actually what happens to the Asian middle class. It has been at the heart of our strategy for a few years. One of the most visible manifestations of the economic success of our sweet spot countries, sweet spots is Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, has been the emergence of a vast and growing insist on both vast and growing middle class with high savings, low levels of household indebtedness and significant needs for production. Frankly, that is an ideal combination for savings and protection company like Prudential. So here, what we have is a simple way of -- I believe capturing the scale and sustainability of the opportunity. I'll ask our team to track the contribution of the middle class for GDP in our sweet spot markets over a long period of time. We have 32 years. As you can see, the Asian middle class's contribution has proven not only extremely resilient over this period in the face of several successive periods of quite significant macroeconomic challenges and upheaval. And we have named a few here. The Asian crisis in '97, '98, the Lehman collapse. What you see is flattening, so you lose all 2 years and then, it starts and comes back again. So please keep that mental image in mind because a little of what I'm going to say further refers to that slide. Our sales across Asia is focused on meeting the needs for protection of that middle class. That straight line over 32 years. The demand for the insurance coverage that we provide to people, protection against illness and accidents in their lives is highly correlated to health care and medical services spending. So we've looked at the behavior of that. What you see here is that it's a nondiscretionary item. It is a good classification from the IMF you have necessities, semi-necessities and discretionary. Health care sittings, the nondiscretionary and semi-necessities, so it's actually quite robust across the economic cycle, and we see that several times this morning. Over the 20 years period told here 1990, 2010, it stays stable. 6% to 7%. That's not a huge movement, but the more interesting thing about Asia is always to look at the absolute numbers that 6% was GBP 28 billion 1990, '10 it's now GBP 92 billion. Okay? It's grown 3.3x, and that is really for us the central theme of the Asian story. And looking forward, they're some really solid projections that it's going to go in the next 20 years to GBP 250 billion. So you've got a triple again. So typical of Asia, it would have gone from GBP 28 billion to GBP 250 billion in that space of time. Now and you've seen the next chart several times. We've used it probably at our '08 Investor Day, if my memory serves me right in Hong Kong but then Barry, the truth will be how to look at expenses. We've been using it time and time again but it's says an important thing. There are large number of customers facing an accident or illness risk for which they may be substantially out of pocket or in other words, a protection gap. And these are great opportunity for insurance companies. It's a great opportunity for an insurance company to come in and offer coverage that will benefit not only those who buy it, but also society at large, whilst generating good return for shareholders. So to summarize, there's a huge and growing unmet demand from protection in Asia. Penetration remains low in a market that itself is going to continue to grow very strongly. So we're starting from a low base in something that itself grows very strongly. So this pie will continue to grow faster than our ability to eat it. The expression I borrowed from Barry, but I think it's very accurate in describing what we face. And I think Barry has a perfect -- he's developing a pin. I saw a draft of it and said, I like pie. It's a red pin. Thank you. I want the first one. So with vast opportunity, of course, has not gone unnoticed. We don't believe that we're the only ones who know this. Anybody who has access to macroeconomic data can run those numbers. And a lot of companies have woken up to the Asian opportunity and are trying to capture it. Indeed, there are more than 200 insurance companies present in Asia today, and the market is constantly seeing a stream of new entrants. So why do we believe that we will continue to be a winner? If I had to give you a one-word answer, I would say, distribution. Having quality and scale in distribution is an absolutely necessary condition, not sufficient, but certainly necessary. For our success in capturing the huge opportunity created by the emergent of this vast middle class. And our philosophy when it comes to distribution it's pretty straightforward and simple. We actually only have one model, it's face-to-face. We believe in face-to-face, needs-based selling and this can be done through 2 different channels: By our agents, or by our financial service consultants in partner bank branches. But fundamentally, it's the same commercial transaction taking place. So starting with agency. This channel, as you see here, is going from strength to strength. We now have over 280,000 agents in our sweet spot markets, and over a 5-year period from '08 to '13, we have tripled the number of agents in this market, while improving their productivity as measured by sales by Asia, by 31%.\r\nTriple agents, 31% more productive. This is why we believe that our agency force is a very significant competitive advantage in and by itself for us. And this is only the beginning. Very significant potential for a long-term sustainable growth of agency distribution in Asia. The education systems of the countries where we operate continue to produce vast numbers of motivated young graduates significantly in excess of our needs. And over the years to come, the multiplier effect of higher headcounts and constantly rising individual productivity will continue to drive higher levels of profitable growth for us allowing us to strengthen and deepen our competitive advantage in our well-established leader position.\r\nMoving away from agency, we remain very optimistic about the growth for our network of bank partners and policy. Banks are essential, at least to our strategy. But because of their long-term nature, they're an art, not a science. So we take a cautious approach. We have been getting lot of questions why don't you do more enough partners well, we take a cautious approach to choosing our partners because we know what it takes for such partnerships to be a truly successful. And we broadly follow 3 principles. The first one is that our partners must have a long-term commitment to our markets and be willing to invest to grow their franchise for good times and bad times just as we do, as that is the recipe for long-term success in Asia. We told you a number of times we're meeting with Asian officials and they tell us, well of course, you Prudential, you're different because in '97, '98, you didn't -- you stayed with us. That means a lot in the context where we operate. We do not want to go with people who will be flavor of the month push emerging markets when you're in another following year. That doesn't interest us. And that shrinks our universe. Second, our partners might be focused on building a successful business in the long term. That's really important. They are banks that understand that the value of a partnership is in building a large growing successful profitable business and in the revenue stream, but over time, this will generate. However, been trying to extract the largest up fund fee possible. These are really interesting fund fees, we'll have a later discussion on that fund fee. We look at the economics of it, it's a small fraction of the economics of the deal. There are banks that understand that and there's -- did you succeed or not. If I knew how long you have been able to build out your proper displays that's where income and revenue stream over 15 years, just for our 15 years versus an initial payment. Okay, so we're only interested in people who understand that because that's what we want we want to build a successful and sizable and material business together. And we believe that if I may dare get an analogy, a partnership is a bit like marriage and auctions are not a great way to choose a spouse. Our partners are banks that share our focus on performance and on the bottom line. But cultural alignment ensures that they will not ask us to do things that do not make sense such as selling products that are unprofitable for us. And frankly, to be candid, we had a few of those situations and we try to get out of it because it just doesn't make sense. You're constantly asked to give money away. That's not what our shareholders pay us for. Okay, and we don't like partners who say \"it will be great if you provided our customer with a product that has a minus 20% margin\", of course, I'm sure the customers will love it. But that's not what we do as a core business. And it's just a very unproductive setup, which just doesn't work in the long term. So these are the 3 principles we look at, and we apply these consistently and they guide us in selecting our partners. So you've seen UOB in 2010, Thanachart in 2012. These more recent partnerships are performing well. Sales at UOB have quadrupled, sales in inception in 2010. And when we used to talk to [indiscernible] the owner and leader, he would say what I love this life business and I'm convinced there is a huge potential there. I want you Prudential to come in and transform this business. Now that's music to our ears, okay? He never told how to check in, and he didn't care and he's really happy in here. I saw him in Singapore 2 months ago, really happy because the business has quadrupled. Trust me he makes much more money from that than from the initial check. Okay, Thanachart, I will come back later. Now our partnership with SCB is we believe the best example of why these principals matter. It has delivered significant growth since inception. Over the last decade, EPS grew by 19% CAGR and has been multiplied by 6x. And the most important fact about SCB is that in spite of all these growth, our penetration of the SCB customer base is 3%. So that is why we are happy to renew our agreement for another 15 years. The new deal we are announcing today provides huge headwind from growth. In a partnership with a proven track record these are not unproven or a startup between 2 new partners. That we've been working successfully with them for 15 years. So we know what we're buying. And here again, with 3% penetration, this pie will continue to grow faster than our ability to eat it. So we said distribution. The strength of our disruption, the quality of our product design allow us to deliver to customers our product at a very affordable cost. In this slide that you also saw in December, we show you the example of Indonesia to illustrate that we're able to provide health insurance coverage at an affordable cost, 5% of income here. So we've been able to grow strongly over a long period of time due to a combination of factor. I've talked about the strong and growing demand for savings and protection plans, so covered that just now. The unparalleled distribution power that we have in just over on that we'll right put it and a fourth factor, we knew which is our geographic diversification. And the resilience of these sales in '08, '09, when many predicted they would collapse. As well as our group since then are visible in this Slide.\r\nAnd before I leave the story, just to leave you with one statistic. You have seen in Q4 of '13, we did GBP 602 million of APE. In the all of 2005, we did GBP 568 million. So and that's not such a long time ago. So we did in Q4 of '13, more business than in the whole of 2005. So that's the kind of performance we've achieved at a regional level. So let me now use a few country examples. And I will talk about Indonesia, Hong Kong and Thailand. I am a little bit unfair to all of our territories where people are doing great things. But I'm sure you intend to have lunch, so I've only taken 3 countries. So let's start with Indonesia. Our Indonesian business is in great shape. We have a leading market position with over 197,000 agents. And it's always feel a bit dizzy after I say that. 197,000 agents in the country and access to greater and actually meant for those of you have been to -- who went to Jakarta, Rinaldi -- we also have Rinaldi in Indonesia. It's absolutely an amazing asset team in itself. An access to greater than 700 bank branches. In 2013, we continue to grow sales further. We have extended our reach across the country, and we showed you the maps outside Jakarta. We believe we're offering the right products, at the right time, to the right channels. And at this stage of the development, of that economy in that country demand for savings and protection products is actually very, very strong. And that is why we have achieved such high rider attachments to our policies, our savings and investment products. And as I showed you earlier, product is affordable, costing 5% of the customers income. So not only our products good value, we also provide high levels of customer service, our unique pool hospital friend, concierge service. Much appreciated by customers is now available at 3x more hospitals than in 2012. And we do that profitably in 2013 IFRS profit in Indonesia grew by 22% on a local currency basis. Demonstrating the strength of the fundamentals that are driving our business 25% on the local currency basis. Now that is all fine, but that is the past. And I know something about results for you, mostly interested in the future. So just to say a word about that. By 2013, the middle class in Indonesia, which is now 45 million. Okay, so we have a 1.9 million, 2 million customers out of 45 million is expected to grow to 135 million. So we are not at risk of running out of growth anytime soon in this market. And we will continue to focus on delivering quality products and services to a rapidly expanding customer base. Here, again, the pie will continue to grow faster than our ability to eat it. But not only are we growing in markets with low insurance penetration. We're also making strong progress in so-called and I insist on so-called, because that's not how we call them, mature markets as Hong Kong. Well, over the last 4 years, in these so-called mature markets, we have more than doubled IFRS operating profits in our life business by growing the scale of the business, acquiring new customers and at the same time, retaining existing customers. In 2013, our APE grew by 23% again in these so called mature market driven by increasing demand for our products, the increasing cases sold by agents as well as higher case sizes. It's one reason Standard Chartered Bank are currently so pleasing because it's very strong in Hong Kong and Hong Kong is a great place to be, quite frankly. The strength of our product and service proposition in Hong Kong allows us to achieve customer retention rates in the high 90s. It is directed to profitability. And it's a great place to be where we do very well. Moving on from Indonesia to Hong Kong to Thailand now, which is the second largest economy in Southeast Asia after Indonesia by GDP. Indonesia is about 300, Thailand is about 380. I told you in the past that we were frustrated that we didn't have a material business in Thailand. And that had been a gap in our original strategy. We're very pleased to say that we are now well on the way to achieving this. Our strategy in this market has been to improve our historically underweight position by strengthening our presence and that was deliberate in the fast-growing bancassurance channel as we knew that the agency channel was challenged and the statistic we see every month confirm that. Our partnership with Thanachart, which launched in May last year has simply transformed the scale of our business in a very short period. From integration, to execution, the local team has delivered the plan flawlessly, and we're very pleased that every single employee of Thanachart decided to join us. It was a great compliment. And the retail preparation to conduct it prior to the official close enabled us to sell our first policy on the first day of launch. As can be seen here, this has transformed the business. And we visit to all those countries, and I guess there always has to be the last one, but being to Thailand was always a bit challenging, because Thailand was simply 11th out of 11 countries. So you go there and try to motivate them. But they've jumped in one go from 11th to 6th, it's now a 6th largest country by profit in Asia in 1-year, and that is with only 8 months of contribution from Thanachart. So we'd like to get the business to compete once against the others so we see off Thailand is now it's more status in the PCA meeting. And at the rate it's growing, we're telling the top 4 with respect because great distribution with Thanachart. They're the fifth largest branch network in the country and it's great position to be. So we're very optimistic about the longer-term prospects in Thailand, despite -- and this is all despite the political turbulence that you have all seen in other countries in 2013. Now I've talked about the commercial success that we are enjoying in each of our countries. But the significant part of our story in Asia is also about the growing profit momentum in Asia, and that is growth is increasingly profit and cash rich. From this slide, you can see 2 distinct phase and I'm going to talk about the first phase first. '05 '07, from '05 '07 we are showing you in gray APE and in black, profit. APE grew by a lot, 86%. While unfortunately, IFRS profits over this period grew only by 2%. So it was a lot of growth, but without much profit or without much cash. And they will come to this point later. I'm sure we'll talk about the dividend, but it's very relevant. From 2008 to 2013, APE sales grew by 81% and IFRS profits quadruple. Now this change in the profit signature is the result of all the work being done by Barry, by his teams in each of our local businesses and our focus on delivering growth and caption. This does not exist before. And you can see the progress we have made in recent years, very clearly on this slide. In 2007, most of our businesses in the region, this shows you by profit born if you watch the countries, okay? Below GBP 50 million, GBP 50 million to GBP 200 million, above GBP 200 million of contribution in IFRS profit. In 2007, most of our businesses in the region were in the lower divisions. There were not generating material profits, and only one business, Singapore, generated more than GBP 50 million of earnings. That is not a long time ago. That's 2007, that's yesterday. 3 of our established businesses at the time, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, the old established businesses in the region, that then contributed 97% of PCA's earnings. So the risk did not exist in terms of profitability. 97% of the profit came from 3 countries.\r\nWe've made some progress since then. Our younger businesses is a completely transformed picture. Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines have together grown their profit 6x since 2007. Yes, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, aggregated, have grown their profit 6x since 2007. In the same period, profits from our more established businesses, the historic 3, I mentioned earlier, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, have actually trebled. So really we haven't done badly at all. We may have trebled, however, thanks to the growth of the rest of the portfolio, they now contribute less than half of our earnings. So when we talk about the diversification, that's what we mean. 3 businesses that used to constitute 97% of our profits, now constitute less than 50%, of a much higher total, because the total profits are also increased in that period. So this is our fundamental answer to those who sometimes are dismissive of the so-called smaller businesses. We have a proven track record of converting the so-called smaller businesses into material contributors over time. Now interestingly, 4 of PCA's local business units, take the top 4 there, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. If they were listed at U.K. life insurance P multiples, maybe a bit harsh, would be FTSE 100 contenders. But I believe with better profitable growth prospects than many life companies in the U.K. So just hold onto that first.\r\nWe are encouraged by many of our newer markets. It is, again, easy to be dismissive of the potential in markets like Myanmar or Cambodia. But we believe that, in time, they will follow on the same trajectory as the likes of Malaysia and Indonesia. Our tried and tested model is replicable and has been proven to work across Asia, and we've been able to transfer it again and again and again.\r\nNow in the next 2 slides that I've used before, but sorry, we making an important one, I just want to reuse it then, please bear with us. They illustrate a fundamental point, the resilience of our sales and the importance of our regulatory end product to our strategy, which is also directly linked to the quality of our distribution. You can only sell regular premium if you have a good sales force. First, single premiums. We know they are volatile across the economic cycle. They dominate in Western insurance markets making the sales of Western life companies are volatile and Asia is no exception. And you can see it on this chart, our single premium sales have been volatile. But the central point we want to make is that the regular premium product have tracked, in red here, have tracked over 2 decades since 1995, very much the middle class aggregate that I showed you earlier, that straight line. These regular premiums contribute, again, 90% of our sales. Regular premium contracts are an ideal vehicle for long-term savings and they remain a product of choice for Asian savers. They address perfectly their growing demand for savings and protection. And have them to make small, but regular contributions, to protect and save for themselves and their families, and Nic will have a few charts showing the flows in our business and you will see the contribution and the strength of that regular premium business to our numbers. And this largely explains why our sales have been resilient across so many economic cycles. But again, in spite of all this growth, the potential for further growth remains very significant as the penetration of these products for which demand is strong, is still low. So this pie will continue to grow faster than our ability to eat it.\r\nNow we often talk about our financial numbers and performance and emphasize it, but financials are only a convenient representation of reality, of what we do, which is to capture a historic opportunity through disciplined execution. We believe that the trajectories shown on these charts can continue long into the future. We have the right team to deliver sustainable long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. Now let me illustrate this point by giving you an insight into how we think internally about our newer markets' long-term prospects.\r\nNow this slide shows you some of the key outputs of one of our internal business plans for one of our smaller markets. Really small. When I say small, you can see here 1,100 agents, 6,000 customers -- sorry for nothing, more than 15,000 policies and APE of GBP 1 million. Now we believe that over the next 15 years, in this market, we will multiply our agency sales force by 100 -- 150x to 200x, grow our customer base by 300x to 400x and issue more than 150x to 200x of policies today in the process, of course, growing this market's APE by 400x to 500x. Now it's still early in the morning, but I know many of you, at this point, are you thinking that this looks crazy. And that you're looking at a slightly deranged financial team.\r\nWell, now, here's a fact. I'm afraid I misled you slightly involuntarily. This slide is not about the future, but about the past. It's not a projection, it's a natural result. We have delivered this performance and the market where we have done this, as you know, is Indonesia. You go 15 years from today, 1998, you realized the amazing transformation that this business has undergone. And this has been repeated by us in other markets in Asia, time and time again. So my apologies for the teasing, but really, this is making an important point. Because we face that disbelief, that skepticism, time and time again when we talk about those exponential curves and the power of compounding. All the mathematicians in the world know the power of compounding. But the human mind can't convert the 0.40 CAGR in 160x. It's just an operation we don't do very well. So that's what we want to illustrate here. We believe we have a proven formula for driving profitable growth. We believe we can replicate our historic success in new markets, while continuing to drive our existing operations to new heights. So why don't we have fun here in this slide. It's a picture of Indonesia at 2 points in time, 14 years apart. Central point, 1998 and then, 2012. You can see here, life insurance premiums have gone up 4x, GBP 2.6 billion to GBP 10.2 billion. But the life insurance penetration is still quite low. After this phenomenal growth that I've showed you, whoa, you're going to run out room, you got to slow down, blah, blah, blah. We have a lot more to go for here. Penetration is barely above 1%. So the pie is growing faster than our ability to eat it. I'll 'repeat it 10x today. That's all you need to understand about the Asian business, the pie is growing faster than our ability to eat it. So stop worrying about how much we're going to eat. Our problem is not to get an indigestion. There's so much pie, that, really, the issue is not, is there enough pie? It's stay disciplined, don't go to fast, that's my firm, this gentleman over there. Say, we go twice faster. It's really about maintaining the quality of the growth and the quality of the distribution. So that we build, not on sand, but we build on solid foundations and we have a profitable sustainable business going into the future.\r\nSo the big 3 examples. We can replicate this in Thailand, I've showed you, we're nowhere, we're #9 the small market share. In the Philippines, we have -- we have a number of chances with 8,000 agents now? Yes? 8,460, something like that, the number changes everyday. And in Myanmar, where we don't even have a business. We can replicate this success and just note, that these 3 countries, when there are worries for potential for growth in Asia, have the same population as Indonesia, all right? So we believe that the long-term potential in these markets, in terms of absolute size, is often underestimated. Each of these countries in 10 years from now will be very material for us, whoever is standing here and giving this presentation, take the commitment.\r\nOur 2017 objectives, which we are absolutely focused on delivering, our milestone on this journey. However, the journey will not end in 2017. We aim to deliver that same profitable growth trajectory for well beyond the period that most observers habitually forecast. So to summarize and conclude in Asia, there's 2 messages. One, It's obvious that there are a few short-term challenges for a number of the economies, but we believe, that the fundamental drivers we talked about this morning are intact and that this pie will continue to grow faster in our ability to eat it and for a long time. Two, we are in the unique position to take advantage of a significant opportunity, thanks to the growing scale and quality of our distribution, our main competitive advantage. And thanks to our focus, more importantly, on the execution and delivery and to the quality of our teams. So much for Asia.\r\nLet me now move to the U.S.. Jackson continues to be one of the strongest players in the U.S. life insurance industry. And has delivered high returns on equity while maintaining a conservative balance sheet. The success that we have enjoyed in the VA industry results from the discipline with which we have implemented our strategy and from our focus on writing only value creating business at every point in the cycle. And that has led us, over time, to very interesting discussions at these presentations and that's the central point, writing only value creating business at every point in the cycle. One way to demonstrate the quality of Jackson's in-force book of policies is to look at the vintages based on the equity market levels, as levered by the S&P 500, at which your business was written. As you can see here, over 2/3 of our book was written at levels below 1,400 of the S&P. So 25% lower than current levels. Importantly, our customers are happy. They have seen their account values grow. In 2013 alone, their average account value grew by 23%, and it is a good rule of thumb, in insurance, that delivering value to customers avoids adverse policyholder behavior. Jackson continues to innovate and the growth of Elite Access to over GBP 4 billion of premiums in 2013, has pushed the contribution of nonliving benefit VAs, in red here, to over 30% of total VA sales. The combination of the pricing changes we've done almost every quarter and also in 2013, the rise in long-term interest rates at the end of the year, have pushed our new business margins higher. As shown on the slide, overall margins on VA are at 76%. However, just keep in mind that these margins here from one year to another on this chart, are not entirely comparable because the  product mix has evolved significantly in the period due to the rapid growth of Elite Access in the last couple of years. Within the 76%, margins on our guaranteed variable annuity products are at an all-time high. Which is why we are very comfortable writing this business today, in volume. The long term consistent approach that Jackson has taken to the annuity industry in the U.S. means that it is now generating sustainable and significant cash remittances for shareholders which is our ultimate yardstick across the group and across [indiscernible].  So undeniably a good performance from Jackson and thank you, Mike.\r\nSo let's now move to the U.K. And there, we'll talk about U.K. Life, and then, M&G. As we showed at the investor conference in December, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid from now on, I'm going to have to use this chart every time I talk about the U.K. life sector. The industry has been generating significant net outflows for the last 5 years. And Nic will come back to that in his chart, regarding our assets, equivalent to almost 14% of industry's assets under management. These assets have largely been flowing to the asset management industry, which has provided simple transparent                                           savings product that meets customer demand. Our strategy, therefore, in shrinking market is to focus on a few products for us for profitable where we have a clear competitive advantage and can deliver genuine value to customers and shareholders. As the left-hand-side chart on this slide shows with-profit product has delivered strong returns over the last 10 years, outperforming its benchmark quite significantly by 49%. This out-performance has translated into good returns for our policyholders with cumulative policies paid over the last 10 years of over GBP 22 billion, as you can see here on the right. And the with-profit capital position remains strong at the end of the year, 2013, and inherited estate was GBP 8 billion. Now moving onto retail annuities. Of course, a lot of attention has been devoted to annuities in the run-up through a thematic review published by VFC [ph] last month. We were, of course, as you would imagine, closely involved in the review work and we support fully the SCA's efforts improve the functioning of the annuities markets. This is a key and important and core product for our pension system and for our economy. No doubt about it. Prudential's annuity product position, actually, we believe, is strong. The chart on this slide shows you some data. The speed of a retail annuity APE in 2013, by type of annuity provided to our customers, just like to make a few points here. First, 37% of our annuity APE comes from the external market. In other words, from customers, who have shopped around and decided to buy an annuity from for Prudential because of the competitiveness of our offering. Second, our enhanced annuity proposition and probably we haven't talked about it enough, is doing well and has grown by 12% in 2013. Good growth. So again, I'm not saying that there's no growth in the U.K., there are issues, there are signals, but if you want, you can grow and profit. And third, of the remaining 60%, okay, if you have 37 and 6, anyway, the remaining 60% of those policies of annuity APE that comes from our existing pension customers, a majority of these, so that's 60%, internal, 80% either have variable guarantees, buy our market-leading with-profit annuities, which have the Income Choice Annuity, which gives them a choice to either take some cash, or take an annuity. Qualify for enhanced annuities or have pension puts less than GBP 30,000 where our rates are quite competitive, and we were quite competitive there because these are people we know well and we feel very comfortable pricing their longevity. When we get outside business, we're always worried about the entire selection and we're just more causes in pricing. And would be great if you can move the debate, probably debate away from pricing because of there are many, many other criteria in buying an annuity. And I'm sure, we've talked about it. But the business runs on numbers, if you look at the value of the embedded guarantee, that guarantees the options, in the old Man from the Pru, followed the people but it's very significant. In the examples I've seen, that the -- valuing that option, they're getting 18% to 50% more value than the average external market price. That's the untold story. Okay? So the 60% of the people are investing internally, we can absolutely demonstrate that 80% are getting a better deal internally than would get from the marketplace. We have all the data, very confident taking that challenge. So on average, our internal customers -- sorry, are not stupid. They shop around, about 80% of them do. They're very aware of the open market option. They make a rational, conscious decision, which, actually, we believe is the right decision, because we have data to support it. They take the best deal for them. This, after 20 years with the Pru, stay with the Pru. And we, actually, give our internal customers annuity rates that are higher than those are available externally. That's the position of this company. So we welcome the FCA thematic review and we're working closely with the regulator and other stakeholders to deliver the best outcome for our customers. Clearly, there are issues there, for instance, we're below 10,000 puts. Yes, there is something to be done there, probably so ABI [ph] made a statement, Monday, about that. There are things that need to be improved. We're not sitting -- standing here, saying, oh, everything's perfect, no. But we're just saying, we need to keep the firm in proportion, and this business has been run very responsibly.\r\nNow like every part of the group, we remain focused on cash generation and the U.K. has done well in that respect in the challenging, again, environment, continuing to deliver tangible value to shareholders as you can see here. In 2013, the U.K. remitted GBP 355 million of cash, it's nothing to sneeze at, achieving its objective of the delivering GBP 350 million by 2013, as we had announced at the investor conference in December. You will remember that Jackie shared with you, in December, again, her early thoughts on the business. She is reporting to the board in the second quarter on the conclusions of her review and we will share any relevant conclusions with you in due course, but to be clear, what you should expect is evolution, not revolution, as Jackie made clear in December in her presentation.\r\nMoving onto M&G, which is where we've seen more growth in the U.K. M&G has grown from its roots as a U.K.-only asset manager to building a large diversified business over the last decade. You can see the results of this strategy on this slide. M&G has not only continued to grow in its home market with retail FUM, funds under management, in the U.K. more than trebling in the last 5 years, but it has also been able to diversify successfully into Europe, where funds under management have grown by almost 8x, 7.60x. This has led to total external retail assets under management growing by 3.5x with higher-margin external assets currently accounting for more than half of the total funds under management, a rare position for an insurance company. This geographic diversification has gone hand-in-hand with diversification, both by asset class and by type of client. As you can see here on the right, the external funds under management is roughly split equally between retail, shown at the top, and institutional, shown at the bottom, with good diversification between equities and fixed income and other asset classes. This lends resilience to the business and positions M&G well, we believe, to perform across economic and market cycles. Underpinning this success is, of course, strong investment performance. And by December '13, 69% of retail funds under management were above median, over a 3-year period, which we believe is an appropriate period to judge performance. And 100% of the institutional segregated fixed income funds were above their respective benchmarks. The successful execution of M&G strategy has resulted in IFRS profits growing by 1.7x over the last 5 years. So here, almost doubling over 5 years. So if I daresay so, Michael and his team have generated Asia-like performance in the European context.\r\nIn 2014, M&G's IFRS operating profit grew by 23%, driven primarily by a 22% increase in external retail funds under management. I will just stop here and say a few words. I know, I'm in the U.K. section but I just to say a few words about the Eastspring and asset management in Asia. Eastspring is also making good progress in delivered IFRS profits, which are 9% higher, in constant currency terms, over -- year-over-year. We are focused on building organically a world-class pan-Asian asset management and we remain a leader in our industry in that respect. Our entry for asset management into newer markets where we already have significant life business expertise, such as Indonesia, augurs well for our future growth in asset management across the region. Let me now turn -- in the final section to the operating performance of our 4 business units and how it has translated, over time, into returns, into growth and cash for shareholders.\r\nOver the last 6 years, and you're familiar with this slide, free surplus generation, our key measure of cash, as you know, kind of looks like -- a key measure of cash, as you know, has more than doubled, and dividend payments have more than tripled. And today's up for dividend re-base is the direct result of a strong operating and financial performance of the group. Now I do not want you, please, to read too much into a sequential upwards re-basis of our dividend over the last 2 years. This reflects the strong financial performance of the group in that period. Our dividend policy remains unchanged. We aim to pay a progressive dividend and of the board will consider a periodic re-base, if and only if, and when we can demonstrate a capital and cash headroom following our internal and stringent stress test and those really cover a range of criteria. So we're actually very stringent and not -- do not just look at one metric.\r\nSo with that, let me now hand over to Nic who will take you through our 2013 results in more detail.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Tidjane. And good morning, everyone. Just about, good morning. In my presentation. I will provide you with a detailed look at the drivers of our performance in 2013, with a particular focus on IFRS profit and free surplus generation, the 2 measures that underpin our new 2017 financial objectives. I will also give you an update on our balance sheet and take you through the new economic capital information.\r\nStarting with the financial headlines. We have delivered a strong performance in 2013, building on the positive momentum of 2012 and accelerating through the second half of the year. Our disciplined execution has enabled us to report double-digit increases in all of the profitability metrics shown on this slide. So as you can see, in 2013, new business profit increased by 16%. IFRS operating profit was up by 17%, with all geographic regions delivering over GBP 1 billion for the first time. Embedded value operating profit rose by 29% and free surplus generation was also higher by 18%.\r\nThe growth that we have enjoyed over the last few years in Asia and the U.S. means that the proportion of the 2013 results transacted in sterling, ranges between 10% and 40% of each total, depending on the metric. Sterling appreciated markedly in the second half of 2013, but the use of average exchange rates means that the translational effect on our reported results is relatively muted at between 0 and minus 2%. And I will come back to this shortly. Working in the other direction, though, our operating results of benefited from rises in both equity markets and long-term yields. We saw this effect come through the half year numbers and this tailwind persisted through the rest of 2013. Now I will point out the areas where this is most pronounced, as I step through the presentation.\r\nLooking at the contribution to each financial metric from our 4 businesses, you can see that the 2013 improvement has been broad-based. In presenting this slide, I remove the currency distortions in order to give you a clean underlying business performance. Asia has delivered a strong double-digit growth across all measures, highlighting, again, the benefit of our focus on regular premium business with a strong bias towards health and protection, which is less prone to market movements and is underpinned by the favorable long-term structural trends that Tidjane has already outlined. Our U.S. business has delivered another excellent trading performance reflecting the more positive investment markets and economic conditions. These improved results were achieved while managing both the size and mix of VA new business sales, reflecting our approach to balancing value, volume, risk and capital generation at this point in the economic cycle. In a year of considerable market disruption, our focus in the U.K. on value and cash generation over volume has seen us sustain our IFRS profits and grow free surplus generation.\r\nFinally, M&G continues its strong track record of attracting flows and this has driven increases in funds under management, earnings and cash. Our overall performance in 2013 demonstrates the quality of our new business franchise, the resilience of our in-force book and our ability to deliver growth in both earnings and cash. I want to deal with the currency translation effect early in my presentation, as I know this is front of mind for many of you. I mentioned earlier, that we use average exchange rates to translate our local currency results into sterling and that this convention has only had a muted effect in 2013. The full impact of the currency falls that we experienced in 2013 will progressively come through the reported 2014 sterling results. It is difficult to predict what the actual impact will be, as we will only know this as we move through 2014. So what I have illustrated on this slide is the effect that using year-end spot rates would have on our 2013 IFRS and free surplus results, which would have been 6% and 5%, respectively. As the pie charts illustrate, the group's overall reported results are mostly exposed to U.S. dollar currency movements. This is also true of Asia results, where the largest contribution comes from countries whose currencies are either directly pegged or managed by reference to U.S. dollars. Please bear in mind that our exposure to foreign currency is purely translational, reporting the fact that we report our results in sterling. We are appropriately focused on earning local currency businesses in each of our markets and we do not take any transactional cross-currency exposure. As Tidjane has already said, we believe that in the long term, our exposure to currencies in high GDP growth countries will be a source of future value for our business. With that covered, I will now move to our 2013 results, starting with IFRS.\r\nOur IFRS operating profit from Asia has exceeded the GBP 1 billion level for the first time, excluding the one-off gain flagged last year from the sale in our stake in China Life of Taiwan. Asia's reported IFRS life profit was up 17% or 20% on a constant exchange rates. Life profits have benefited from strong contributions by the faster growing markets in Southeast Asia. Taken together, our 4 largest businesses in Indonesia, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, delivered double-digit growth, producing GBP 748 million of IFRS profit, exceeding the contribution from our U.K. life business for the first time.\r\nOur smaller fast-growing businesses in Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam have also made encouraging progress during 2013. On a combined basis, they accounted for over half of the increase in Asia's life profits, contributing 12% of the total, up from 6% the previous year. We continue to grow the scale of our life book in Asia, which we measure by reference to policyholder liabilities, as shown on the chart in the top right in your books.\r\nDuring 2013, the addition of another sizable cohort of regular premium policies, combined with a lower exit rate from in-force, has generated net life inflows of GBP 2.3 billion equivalent to 12% of opening reserves. This is a new high and it is the first time since the crisis that we have seen net inflows above the GBP 2 billion level. What this shows is that in a year where many commentators have expressed fears about the economic outlook for emerging markets, customer behavior on the ground has not been impacted. If anything, retention improved in 2013, as illustrated in the slides charting the surrender and partial withdrawal rates, that are included in the appendix. Invested market and other movements have been net positive contributing further to the growth of our book. While in local currency terms, the stock of the liabilities is not impacted, you can see at the chart the effect of translating this back into sterling. So the dynamic that I have referred to before, of focusing our sales effort on new regular premium business, with a sizable health and protection content, sold to a very sticky customer base is evident, once again.\r\nTurning to the chart in the bottom right. Life income has grown by 14% at constant exchange rates reflecting both the larger scale and the high return nature of Asia's business. Costs have also grown, but at slower rate of 11%. If we now look at Asia's life business performance in more detail, the sources of earnings analysis shown here, confirms most of the key messages from our previous slide. Technical and other margin, shown in the middle, remains a dominant feature of Asia's life income. Within this category, insurance margin grew by 15% to GBP 679 million, reflecting strong growth in health and protection business and a contribution of positive claims experience. Marginal revenue is also higher at GBP 1,562 million. I would remind you that deferral and amortization of acquisition costs is not a significant feature of our Asia results, which means that our accounting earnings are very close to cash earnings.\r\nTurning to the U.S., IFRS operating profit was strongly up at GBP 1.3 billion, driven by a 29% increase in the life result. The 2013 results include a full year contribution from REALIC of GBP 128 million, which compares to GBP 67 million in the previous year. Excluding REALIC, the improvement in the result is primarily due to higher fee income, which has benefited from strong growth in variable annuity account balances. The growth in the scale of Jackson's business is illustrated, again, on the chart in the top right in your books. Policyholders' liabilities have increased to GBP 107.4 billion as net life inflows contributed GBP 9.6 billion. This is the fifth year in a row that life net inflows, in other words, the component that we control, have added more than 10 percentage points of growth to the stock of opening reserves. The strong S&P 500 rally in 2013 contributed a further GBP 8.2 billion. As was the case for Asia, the currency translation effect is only relevant to sterling reporting purposes. As well as being best-in-class from a service perspective, Jackson's operating platform is both scalable and efficient. The benefit of this is evident on the chart in the bottom right, where the positive JAWS [ph] effect is clear with revenues -- revenue continuing to grow at a faster rate than expenses. Turning to the detailed sources of earnings analysis for the U.S., I would like to draw your attention to 3 areas: Firstly, fee income, which has grown by 34% to GBP 1,172 million, in line with the 35% growth in average separate  account balances. Fees are marginally lower due to the increased proportion of Elite Access, which has a lower M&E fee. Secondly, insurance margin, which has grown to GBP 588 million reflecting the extra contribution from REALIC's term insurance business, which is delivering the objective of both growing and diversifying Jackson's earnings. Thirdly, spread profits, which are marginally higher at GBP 730 million, as we maintain their overall spread margin through crediting rate actions. We continue to anticipate that spreads will tend towards the 200 basis point level in the near term.  We are pleased with the evolution of the shape of Jackson's sources of income, which is delivering improvements in both the quality and the resilience of its earnings.\r\nMoving to the U.K., IFRS operating profit was in line with the previous year at GBP 735 million. The chart, on the left, analyzes the results between what I would call the underlying retail life result in red, the contribution from bulks, the general insurance commission and the one-off profit from the longevity swap we executed earlier in the year. The overall result continues to be driven by our focus on with-profits and annuities. The main change between the 2 years is the lower shareholder transfer from with-profits reflecting the reduction in bonuses. In 2013, life inflows for our shareholder backed business remain negative and have been mitigated but positive investment market movements. The with-profits picture, if I had put that one up would be similar, and both are consistent with the transfers we have observed for the number of years in the U.K. life sector that Tidjane has already illustrated. Now despite these trends, as you can see in the bottom right, we have defended our overall level -- our overall life income levels by focusing on those parts of the market where returns are most attractive and by being disciplined about our new business economics. Expenses, as you can see, were 4% lower.\r\nAs I have said before, genuinely attractive investment opportunities are more limited in the U.K. life sector relative to other parts of the business, and this will continue to place downward pressure on our earnings prospects. We remain comfortable with this as it does not detract from the important role that the U.K. plays in our group.\r\nTurning to M&G, IFRS operating profit was 23% higher at GBP 395 million. This strong performance reflects the growth and the scale of the retail business, which is our most profitable segment.\r\nFor M&G, the key driver of earnings is the growth in external funds under management. As you can see in this chart, external funds under management are up 13%, reflecting net inflows totaling GBP 9.5 billion and the positive effect of investment market movements, which have added a further GBP 4.6 billion.\r\nTotal external funds under management of GBP 126 billion at the end of 2013 represent a new high and our testament to M&G's track record of positive net inflows for the 11th year in a row.\r\nThe growth in funds under management has been achieved principally in the retail segment where fee income is highest. As Tidjane has already explained, retail funds under management were 22% higher in 2013, underpinned by a strong sales performance in Europe. The success in retail has driven an 18% increase in underlying fee revenues, which you can see on the chart in the bottom right.\r\nAs I indicated this time last year, we're making additional investments in 2013 and 2014 in scaling up the infrastructure of M&G's business. Reflecting this investment, M&G's total costs are higher, but the effect has been absorbed by the increase in revenue, leaving the total cost income ratio unchanged at 59% year-on-year.\r\nI will now move to free surplus, the measure that we use to track cash generation in our business. Starting with the table on the left, our life in-force profit and asset management businesses have generated GBP 3,099 million of free surplus in 2013, representing a 15% increase over 2012.\r\nNow this figure was around GBP 1 billion in 2005. It reached GBP 2 billion in 2009 and has now exceeded GBP 3 billion.\r\nIn other words, we have added GBP 1 billion every 4 years. It is our ability to grow free surplus through writing high return, fast payback new business that distinguishes Prudential's business model from that of others.\r\nWe continue to take actions to optimize capital consumption and have invested GBP 637 million in 2013 to write new business. This is 3% higher than 2012, reflecting the combination of pricing actions, changes in business mix and the favorable impact of the rising yields through the year. On the right, we analyze the contribution of each business. And as you can see, all 4 businesses are making significant and growing contributions to the total.\r\nMy next slide shows how this cash generation has impacted the stock of free surplus and central cash.\r\nStarting on the left, the net free surplus generated in 2013 helps absorb the negative GBP 807 million impact of market movements, including a negative GBP 200 million currency effect and funded cash remittances to group, totaling GBP 1,341 million, representing an increase of 12%. This leaves some GBP 4 billion of free surplus stock, which we can either deploy to finance future growth or can act as a buffer against future economic shocks. As we said in December, over the last few years, we have managed our internal remittance ratio within a corridor. We believe that it is appropriate to retain the flexibility that a range affords, leaving scope to manage the group for fluctuations in economic cycle and to pursue business opportunities. You can see how these remittances have impacted central cash on the right, which, after deducting several costs and external dividends and adding the net proceeds from hybrid insurances, meant that we closed 2013 at GBP 2.2 billion, which is a healthy position.\r\nBefore leaving this topic, I wanted to reemphasize the reliability of future free surplus generation by updating you on the undiscounted monetization profile of our life operations.\r\nBy now, you will be familiar with these charts. The dark blue bars in the top chart represent the end 2012 life in-force monetization profile as we reported a year ago. The light blue bars represent the updated profile of the end 2012 block of business one year later. These bars are now higher than before, reflecting the positive impact of rises in yields between the 2 periods, which have compensated for the negative currency translation effect.\r\nNow when we add the cash flows from the 2013 new business cohort shown in red, we have an overall profile that is higher than the one we started with, evidence of the powerful capital dynamics of our business model.\r\nI will now cover briefly the EEV basis results before turning to capital. On this basis, life operating profit was up 27% to 5,639 million. As you can see in the chart on the left, the improvement is broad based and is equivalent to a return on opening embedded value of 19%. We estimate that the rise in long-term yields experienced in 2013 has contributed some GBP 450 million to this total.\r\nThe chart on the right summarizes the contribution from new and in-force business. New business profit was up 16%, and I will come back to this shortly. In-force profit was 42% higher at nearly GBP 2.8 billion. As shown in the breakout box, the increase reflects a combination of growth in the book, favorable variances and the beneficial effect of higher long-term interest rates. The latter point is evident in the numbers labeled unwind. Approximately, GBP 250 million of the increase in 2013 relates to the positive gearing from the rise in long-term yields.\r\nIn 2011 and 2012, when interest rates were falling, I flagged that the unwind had been negatively impacted by GBP 200 million and GBP 83 million, respectively. Therefore, while interest rates are not yet back to 2010 levels, we have recouped most of the drag that we experienced in the unwind on the way down. The drivers of the positive experience variances and assumption changes are summarized on this slide.\r\nIn Asia, all factors including persistency, mortality, morbidity, have remained in positive territory, in line with recent trends. This provides yet more evidence that customer behavior has not been impacted by the macroeconomic concerns.\r\nIn the U.S, we have seen a continuation of positive -- of the positive contribution from spread, reflecting the success of the actions taken by management to mitigate the low interest rate risk. Other items include favorable persistency of GBP 134 million, which reinforces our prudent approach to assumption setting and to pricing.\r\nIn the U.K, both years benefited from the effect of the reductions in U.K. corporation tax rates. The contribution from other is distorted by one-off items, but the underlying position is positive in both years.\r\nPositive experience has been a regular feature of our results since the crisis, a period characterized by significant global macroeconomic uncertainty and market volatility.  Our strong performance here confirms both the quality and the resilience of our franchise.\r\nNew business profits, shown on this next slide, grew by 16% to GBP 2,843 million. The table on the right analyzes the drivers of this growth, with volume, pricing and mix contributing 9 percentage points of the increase; and higher long-term yields, a further 8 points.\r\nAll 3 regions continued to write new business at internal rates of return of more than 20% with short payback periods. In Asia, new business profit was 15% higher at GBP 1,460 million. At constant exchange rates, the increase was 19%, with both agency and bank channels growing NBP at similar pace.\r\nThe improved profitability reflects the growth in our 7 sweet spot markets where NBP was 21% higher, driven by health and protection. The rise in yields had a small positive overall effect on NBP, reflect -- benefiting Hong Kong due to its bias towards savings products and dampening Indonesia due its focus on protection, which attracts a lower EEV valuation at higher interest rates even though the profit signature is unaffected.\r\nIn the U.S., NBP increased by 24% to GBP 1,086 million. Within this number, the contribution from variable annuities increased from GBP 809 million to GBP 1,023 million. This is despite the 7% decline in sales of VAs with guarantees, the negative effect of which was counted by the positive effect of product and pricing actions; the contribution from elite access; and the beneficial impact of the 130 basis points increase in treasury yields, which added GBP 150 million to the U.S. NBP.\r\nU.K. retail NBP was 3% lower. This is despite the 12% reduction in retail sales, the effect of which was mostly compensated by pricing and product actions and improvements in mix. The economics of the business sold in the U.K. are extremely attractive when you consider that this NBP was delivered by investing GBP 29 million of capital.\r\nMoving now to the rest of the profit and loss account for both IFRS and EEV. In my interim results presentation, I walked you through the mechanics of the IFRS accounting mismatch that is generated from Jackson's hedges when equity markets rise. I will not repeat the explanation beyond reminding you that this arises because hedges are fully mark-to-market and liabilities are mostly marked to cost. Equity markets rallied further since June, so the negative effect of accounting mismatch reoccurred in the second half of the year, although the impact was more subdued. We remain committed to our approach of hedging on an economic basis and are happy to accept the volatility in the accounting results that ensues. In addition, the further rises in interest rates in the second half generated some more negative value movements on our holdings of fixed income securities. Under IFRS, this come through investment variances and unrealized losses on AFS securities. And as you can see, the impact compared to the first half was also much reduced.\r\nThe most significant effect in the second half was the negative GBP 0.4 billion arising from translating our U.S. and Asia IFRS net assets at the year-end exchange rates.\r\nOverall, the strength of our operating performance in the second half has been sufficient to absorb all these factors. So after deducting the interim dividend, our IFRS shareholders' equity is slightly higher at GBP 9.7 billion compared to June 2013.\r\nOn EEV, investment variances are positive in both halves, reflecting our ability to recognize on this basis the full economic benefit of the improved market returns. Profits for the period, therefore, accelerated in the second half and were only partially offset by the negative currency translation effect of GBP 1.8 billion.\r\nNonetheless, the strength of our operating performance was such that retained earnings boosted our shareholders' funds by 93p over the course of 2013 to 971p per share.\r\nI have provided you on this slide the usual update on the balance sheet. In short, the overall picture is unchanged. We remain well capitalized and defensively positioned. All of our key underlying solvency metrics have improved. The with-profits estate stood at GBP 8 billion at the end of 2013.\r\nAt the start of 2014, following the completion of our domestication product, some GBP 1.2 billion of the estate was transferred to the newly created Hong Kong life entity, leaving both funds well capitalized. The U.S. RBC ratio has improved to 450%, which attests to Jackson's disciplined approach to managing its capital base. Our stance on hedging our U.S. variable annuity exposures is unchanged, and the $1.3 billion fees that we will levy for providing guarantees in 2014 provides an ample budget to hedge.\r\nWe have updated the information relating to Jackson's capital formation, capital sensitivities to shocks and customer behavior and have included these in the appendix to your slides.\r\nIn my remaining slides, I set out a summary of the group's economic capital position based on our current Solvency II internal model.\r\nWe're still 2 years away from having to adopt Solvency II and, notwithstanding the Omnibus II breakthrough, further clarity is needed in a number of areas, which will be provided when the level 2 and level 3 guidance is finalized. Furthermore, the PRA has not reviewed and approved our internal model, and this is a further source of uncertainty. All this to say that these results should be viewed as highly indicative and subject to change but provide you with a first view of Prudential's solvency position on a risk-sensitive basis.\r\nThe key assumptions underpinning the calculations are shown on this slide and are set out in more detail in your -- in a new section that we've created in your packs. The results assume U.S. equivalent, incorporating Jackson's surplus over the 250% RBC level, consistent with our approach to free surplus reporting. The 250% level is informed by the results of our internal multi-year economic capital model, which we believe provides a good proxy for the risk capital that we need to carry in this business. Furthermore, the results do not reflect the matching adjusting -- adjustment concept for U.K. annuities, pending further development of the calibration at European level and a decision on whether certain types of securities will be excluded.\r\nAs you can see, the economic capital surplus at the end of 2013 is GBP 11.3 billion, equivalent to a cover of 257%. The level of required capital of GBP 7.2 billion, shown in blue, represents the risk capital needed to withstand a 1 in 200-year event over a 1-year time horizon.\r\nAvailable capital of GBP 18.5 billion, shown in red, represents a more economic view of our group's resources, removing unnecessary prudence from our Solvency I basis technical provisions and disapplying asset valuation restrictions.\r\nThe top chart on this next slide provides you with analysis of the risk profile of our business under this new basis. Around half of the group's undiversified risk capital requirement relates to market risk, shown in the red segments in the pie, and the other half to non-market risks, shown in the blue and green segments. The group's most material market risk exposures are to credit risk, principally from the U.K. and Jackson fixed annuity portfolios; and to equity markets mainly from with-profit shareholder transfers in the U.K. and the fund-related charges in Asia. The group's most material non-market risk exposure is to lapse mortality and morbidity risk in Asia and to longevity risk on U.K. annuities.\r\nAs you can see, our overall profile is not highly concentrated to any particular risk type. Our modeling shows that some 54% of risks diversify away. And in line with the Solvency II guidance on U.S. equivalent, no credit has been taken for the diversification of benefits between our U.S. business and the rest of the group.\r\nThe chart at the bottom of the slide shows the sensitivity to the end 2013 economic capital position to a variety of market shocks. The key message here is that the balance of our risks is such that the impact of these shocks is manageable. So the resilience of the business model, now something that we have commented on in the past by reference to other metrics, is also evident through this risk-sensitive measure.\r\nMy final slide on the topic analyzes the movement in the estimated surplus during 2013. I will let you study this analysis at your leisure, but the key takeaways are: one, that the group's operations generated 31 percentage points of solvency cover in 2013; that higher equity markets and rises in long-term yields have contributed a further 12 points of cover; and that all the other effects have broadly netted out.  The fact that at an operating level flow is positive should not be a surprise to you.\r\nWe write low-strain, high-return, fast-payback business, so the capital generation dynamics should be positive irrespective of the accounting or solvency lens that you may choose to use to assess this. The fact that the stock kick is high should also not be a surprise as a large component of our book in Asia is health and protection, which is Solvency II-friendly.\r\nIn addition, the stock includes the shareholders' interest in future with-profit transfers, which is sizable, reflecting the scale of the business. I want to emphasize that economic capital is one of a number of financial metrics that we use to run our business and that it is no more or no less important than other metrics. While this information is new for the market, it is not new for us, and I have been -- and we have been using aspects of economic capital alongside other financial measures to inform our day-to-day decisions.\r\nTherefore, what you should take from this is the fact that it reaffirms what we have always said about the positive cash and capital dynamics of our business.\r\nSo by way of concluding remarks, I would like to iterate: one, that the strength of our overall performance in 2013 -- to highlight the strength of our overall performance, which demonstrates the quality of the new business franchise and the resilience of our in-force book and also our ability to continue to deliver to grow -- to deliver growth both in earnings and cash; and two, the improvement in  our capital buffers, reflecting both the strong operational performance and the investment market tailwinds.\r\nWith that, I will now hand you back to Tidjane.\n\n---\n\nThank you. Thank you, Nic. So to summarize on 2013, the group has delivered a strong performance with double-digit increases in all our key metrics, as Nic just showed you, and has been able to achieve all our 2013 growth and cash objectives.\r\nOur performance during the 2008 to 2013 period, which culminated in the delivery of our 2013 objectives, has allowed us to transform the financial characteristics of the group, which has now a high-quality and growing earnings base, with all 4 business units contributing materially to cash. This newly acquired diversity of cash and earnings is a key source of strength for the group. This is what has allowed the board, led by the Chairman here this morning, to declare a 15% upwards rebate of our 2014 full year dividend.\r\nOur dividend policy remains unchanged, and we aim to provide a growing dividend to shareholders in a sustainable and prudent manner. Asia remains core to the group's future prospects, but tailwinds of favorable long-term structural trends, a leading business platform and best-in-class execution position us well to deliver an enduring value for both customers and shareholders. Now this is all good news, but I want to reiterate that we are not complacent.\r\nActually, paranoia and competitiveness are very well shared features in this group, and I don't think Jackie has changed that profile. He just joined us.\r\nSo we have embarked on a new set of objectives after delivering the equally challenging 2013 objectives. The group has tremendous growth opportunities. We have the platform, the ability and the discipline to deliver on these opportunities and to create value for both our customers and our shareholders. We are in the right markets, so in the right place, at the right time. And if you allow me a bad joke here, a lot of people talk about being in the right place at the right time. A lot of people will be in Brazil this summer. So they'll be in the right place at the right time. It doesn't mean they'll win the World Cup. So you can only do that if you have the right people, which is why I will finish. We're in the right place at the right time, but we also have the right people. And that's the whole difference.\r\nSo I am confident that we will continue to deliver a unique combination of growth and cash over the long term. I thank you, and we are ready to take your questions.\r\nSo for the first time, I can say, lady and gentlemen, if you can join us on the podium, we'll start the Q&A session, please.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nGood morning, and welcome to our full year 2013 results presentation. Prudential has delivered a strong performance in 2013 with double-digit growth across all our key performance metrics. We are pleased to announce that we have achieved all 6 of our 2013 'Growth and Cash' objectives. As you know, we've been early in talking about cash, and we have been focusing on that metric since 2008. From a situation of great dependency on the U.K. in terms of cash and earnings in 2007, we are now in a position where each of our 4 businesses is materially cash generative. We have also been able in parallel to generate I believe more growth than any other large-cap insurance company. So we have not only talked about 'Growth and Cash', we have been able to deliver on that promise. And in the end, it is this delivery only that matters. People sometimes are kind enough to refer to the quality of our strategy. I actually think that what is really unique about this company and its team is our focus on execution and our ability to deliver consistently. A few weeks ago at investor seminar, the motto was more of the same. This remains our motto with a little twist this morning, which is more of the same, just better. The renewal announced this morning of our strategic bancassurance agreement with Standard Chartered Bank is a good example of that, more of the same, just better. The previous agreement was already a good one. In the past 15 years, our sales from this partnership have grown by 160x. The new agreement is a clear improvement on the previous one. It is longer, it is deeper and it is broader than the previous agreement. It is longer, this new agreement will run for 15 years -- where's Greg. So Greg, we don't have -- to have this banter, when does it end anymore. 15 years, I can finally take that question with a smile. 2029 it's been going on for a long -- and thank you for your patience, Greg. You've been really -- he has been really good.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nThis is the point, of course.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nI know. I'm trying to buy some goodwill here. I know my time will come. It's very transparent. So it's a longer agreement. It's broader. It gives us access to 11 markets in Asia, and it secures exclusive rights to discuss bancassurance agreements in 7 additional markets in the near future. It's also deeper because in a number of markets, we are strengthening our existing relationship as we move to either exclusive or preferred terms. And last but not least, as part of the agreement, we will work with SCB to explore some of the huge opportunities available to us in Africa. Our teams know and respect each other. They work very well together as evidenced by the growth of our business over the last 15 years, I've said 160x. That is why we are confident that this new agreement giving us unfettered access to one of the best banking franchises in Asia, about 800 branches in the new agreement, is a milestone in our development. With that, I will follow today my usual format. I will start with the highlight of our full year results and then, we'll comment on a few key aspects of our strategy. As usual, there will be a focus on Asia, but we will also cover Jackson and our businesses in the U.K., the life businesses and M&G. I will then hand over then to Nic, who'll cover our financial performance in more detail. And I will come back at the end to talk about the outlook for rest of the year and beyond, and we will then take your questions. As always, the executive team from across the group are here and they will do their best to answer any questions you may have. And I'm sure we'll have opportunities to intervene.\r\nSo back to 2013. IFRS operating profit grew 17% to GBP 2.954 million (sic) [GBP 2.954 billion], we wanted to reach GBP 3 billion, but we stopped a bit short of that, but GBP 2.954 billion. We've often talked about doubling in 4 years for Asia, well we have actually been able to double the entire group in 4 years. We've gone from GBP 1.4 billion in '09 to close to GBP 3 billion in '13. New business profits grew by 16% to over GBP 2.8 billion, and we win that Asia has achieved the last remaining 2013 objective, you've heard me many times saying it was the most challenging. I believe it was. So it's been the last one in time to be achieved. And we're pleased it was achieved with doubling the NBP to GBP 1.46 billion in spite of significant effects of headwinds, so it's good performance. Now importantly, these earnings have been converted into cash and our key measure of cash generation, free surplus generation, is up by 18% to almost GBP 2.5 billion with, again, material contributions for more business units, and I'll come back to that. Our capital position remains strong. And as we promised, that's another long running debate between us. We have today published for the first time our recurring capital ratio, which is 257% for 2013. Nic will give you much more detail on this in his presentation. And our IGD solvency 1 surplus capital remains unchanged, GBP 5.1 billion. It is this continuing strong operating and financial performance and robust capital position of the group that have enabled the board to re-base our dividend upwards by 15% to 33.57 pence. So in a nutshell, these results demonstrate that the group has been able to deliver on its promise of generating both growth and cash.\r\nBack to the objective we have achieved now all 6 of our objectives. In that process, the financial characteristics of the group have been transformed, and all businesses are now remitting significant amounts of cash and PCA Asia delivered over GBP 1 billion of IFRS operating profit. You'll all familiar with this slide by now. We viewed this many times, but it shows you also the change of scale that has been achieved in that period. Asia has more than doubled in the top there, both NBP and IFRS in 4 years. Asia's cash remittance has increased 10x. Jackson's net remittance has increased more than 7x. And the U.K. has continued to generate large amounts of cash in a challenging contest. So we tried to capture on 1 page then, some of the key developments of 2013. So as always, we'll start by talking about our customers. Our progress in Asia has allowed us to acquire 1.9 million new customers in 2013. I was in Hong Kong last week with Barry, and we did the calculation in our idle time. And we came down, if you take a 24/7 basis to 1 policy every 10 seconds in Asia. Assuming we work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. So I've given the new challenge to Barry, which is to beat Usain Bolt and break the 10-second barrier. We need to go to 1 every 8 seconds or something like that, even better. We have extended -- thank you. Our distribution reach in Asia, we have a new agreement with Standard Chartered, I've just described. We have conducted the integration of Thanachart in very fast times. Sold our first policy in May, the first day after receiving regulatory approval. And our new Thai business as you'll see later is already making a material contribution to our profits. Across our  bancassurance relationships to give you number, NBP in our sweet spot markets grew by 23% in the year, a pleasing result. We have also achieved the long running ambition of the group by domesticating our REITs profits business in Hong Kong, separating the U.K. REIT profit from the Hong Kong REIT profit from. We have entered new markets in Asia. We have launched in Cambodia in February, or January? February?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nJanuary.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nJanuary 2013. And we've opened now a representative office in Myanmar. Moving from Asia to the U.S., we have continued to innovate as demonstrated by the success of Elite Access, which generated $4 billion of premiums in 2013, triple the level achieved 1 year before. The REALIC acquisition we announced in May 2012 has been successfully integrated, and you can see its contribution to its numbers. It's been delivering above the expected benefits and has contributed to enhancing and diversifying our revenue stream in the U.S. In asset management, we've continued to expand M&G's presence in Europe, driving European retail funds under management up 64% to GBP 24 billion. And in addition to our well-known portfolio, PCA, Jackson, U.K. Life, M&G, we have entered Africa for a small acquisition in Ghana. We also played an integral part in reaching an agreement with regulators and politicians in November last year on Omnibus II, directive of Solvency II. This agreement provides more clarity, we believe, to you our investors on the capital indications of the new regime. And also ensures that we insurers can continue to play our role in financing the long-term capital needs of the economy. Now this chart for us is just the translation in financial terms of all these actions we have conducted since 2008. And I think every year has been at least as busy as 2013, when you list everything that's been done. 2013 adds 1 more year to our track record built now over several years. And refers to bars on the left, we've let them on this chart because they're interesting. They're empty because we only started measuring our sources of earnings in 2008, and those of you who were in this presentation at the time so at the half year of '08, these results being presented for the first time. And what gets measured, gets managed. We all know that. So since then, our focus on driving growth and fee income and insurance margin has delivered growing scale with improved quality with 31 CAGR for almost 2 categories together, over 5 years. And they've moved from 38% of our earnings from 63% in the total, but itself has more than doubled. So it's been really a very important part of the strategy. In more simplistic terms, just looking at cash, cash straightforward from being highly dependent on the U.K. in '08, which you can see here and even more in '09, the U.K. in '08 was contributing 40% of the group's remittances. We are now better balanced, well diversified group with material contributions from all our 4 business units, something we told you we wanted to achieve. It is hard to overstate the importance of this transformation from a group. Probably, we are able to run it. For our options in terms of profitable growth and investments, I mean those Standard Chartered deal based on internal resources, as well as for cash rewards over time for shareholders. Now achieving the 2017 objectives, of course, represents an important milestone for the company. However, you know us, we never want to be complacent and it is a luxury, sadly, that we cannot afford. I wish we could. As announced, at the investor conference in December, we have set ourselves new and challenging objectives that underline the scale of our continued ambition for this group. We are essentially looking to double Asia from this already larger and higher base is while also aiming to generate cash equivalent to 1/3 of the current market capital of the group. Now of course, we have not given you the balance for '14, '15, '16 because we do not want to forecast the shape of our trajectory. But these will be 4 additional years of hard work, and we are confident that we will get there by 2017, above GBP 1 billion of free surplus generation in Asia, set between GBP 900 million and GBP 1.1 billion. GBP 1.8 billion of IFRS profit and GBP 10 billion of cumulative group free surplus generation over 4 years after funding significant growth.\r\nNow of course, a key consideration when we're looking ahead towards 2017, is the macroeconomic context. We actually believe that the macroeconomic environment today has become more supportive for our group. And actually, largely validates our geographic focus. With the stream of positive economic news that we have recently received in the U.S. and U.K. are good news for our businesses there. Today I was reading, this morning WACD is now at 3.3 for the U.K. So it's all positive. And put simply, if you think about financial risks at Prudential, it is mostly sitting in Jackson and in U.K., and as the U.S. and the U.K. economies continue to recover and as long-term interest rates rise, accordingly, there will be a strong beneficial impact on both the profits of our businesses and their capital strength in the U.S. and in the U.K.\r\nNow moving onto Asia. Of course, some of the currency weakness that we have seen in a few select Asian countries following the Federal Reserve's tapering of quantitative easing will impact our reported financial in 2014, and Nic will provide you a sense of that impact looking at 2013 on spot rates. We'll give you the sensitivities. But looking through here, this ultimate is very small number of high-level comment, which I believe are important. In each country, we must keep in mind that we are fundamentally in local currency. And we have, so to speak, no cross-currency exposure in the business model. When we face the market, we're not a car manufacturer -- manufacturing from a high base country, high-cost country, having to sell into the Indonesian market. We do not import any raw materials. All our inputs and our outputs are local. Our assets and liabilities are matched in local currency. So clearly, the only and the main FX exposure, as we'll know is non-economic. It is purely a translation exposure. The Vietnamese dong, those rupiahs we're collecting, they're sitting there in our coffers. Okay? The only thing that changes is how many pounds that represents. And what matter as in the long-term business that covers is actually the rupiahs and the dongs that we're collecting and the economic fundamentals in those countries. And we believe these are sound in our sweet spot countries, and we have evidence to support that. In effect, growth has proven resilient in our sweet spot countries and on the ground businesses in all these countries are doing well. As a result on a local currency basis, we continue to grow strongly. And all of you remains that over the medium to long-term, currency values are highly correlated with GDP growth. So we are happy to be predominantly in a part of the world that grows faster than the rest of the world. That is the long-term positive of this stuff. Because clearly, Asia continues to be the main driver of global growth. It's, of course, the long-running debate around whether China will grow at 6.5%, 7% 7.5%. A bit marginal difference in China is GDP growth will not matter too much for Prudential, and we have much more data to show you why. And the relatively negative sentiment vis-à-vis Asia that prevails in financial markets today seems to us to be somewhat disconnected from the drivers of the real economies that we see locally via our businesses. Now within this context, what really matters the most to us and to our story is actually what happens to the Asian middle class. It has been at the heart of our strategy for a few years. One of the most visible manifestations of the economic success of our sweet spot countries, sweet spots is Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, has been the emergence of a vast and growing insist on both vast and growing middle class with high savings, low levels of household indebtedness and significant needs for production. Frankly, that is an ideal combination for savings and protection company like Prudential. So here, what we have is a simple way of -- I believe capturing the scale and sustainability of the opportunity. I'll ask our team to track the contribution of the middle class for GDP in our sweet spot markets over a long period of time. We have 32 years. As you can see, the Asian middle class's contribution has proven not only extremely resilient over this period in the face of several successive periods of quite significant macroeconomic challenges and upheaval. And we have named a few here. The Asian crisis in '97, '98, the Lehman collapse. What you see is flattening, so you lose all 2 years and then, it starts and comes back again. So please keep that mental image in mind because a little of what I'm going to say further refers to that slide. Our sales across Asia is focused on meeting the needs for protection of that middle class. That straight line over 32 years. The demand for the insurance coverage that we provide to people, protection against illness and accidents in their lives is highly correlated to health care and medical services spending. So we've looked at the behavior of that. What you see here is that it's a nondiscretionary item. It is a good classification from the IMF you have necessities, semi-necessities and discretionary. Health care sittings, the nondiscretionary and semi-necessities, so it's actually quite robust across the economic cycle, and we see that several times this morning. Over the 20 years period told here 1990, 2010, it stays stable. 6% to 7%. That's not a huge movement, but the more interesting thing about Asia is always to look at the absolute numbers that 6% was GBP 28 billion 1990, '10 it's now GBP 92 billion. Okay? It's grown 3.3x, and that is really for us the central theme of the Asian story. And looking forward, they're some really solid projections that it's going to go in the next 20 years to GBP 250 billion. So you've got a triple again. So typical of Asia, it would have gone from GBP 28 billion to GBP 250 billion in that space of time. Now and you've seen the next chart several times. We've used it probably at our '08 Investor Day, if my memory serves me right in Hong Kong but then Barry, the truth will be how to look at expenses. We've been using it time and time again but it's says an important thing. There are large number of customers facing an accident or illness risk for which they may be substantially out of pocket or in other words, a protection gap. And these are great opportunity for insurance companies. It's a great opportunity for an insurance company to come in and offer coverage that will benefit not only those who buy it, but also society at large, whilst generating good return for shareholders. So to summarize, there's a huge and growing unmet demand from protection in Asia. Penetration remains low in a market that itself is going to continue to grow very strongly. So we're starting from a low base in something that itself grows very strongly. So this pie will continue to grow faster than our ability to eat it. The expression I borrowed from Barry, but I think it's very accurate in describing what we face. And I think Barry has a perfect -- he's developing a pin. I saw a draft of it and said, I like pie. It's a red pin. Thank you. I want the first one. So with vast opportunity, of course, has not gone unnoticed. We don't believe that we're the only ones who know this. Anybody who has access to macroeconomic data can run those numbers. And a lot of companies have woken up to the Asian opportunity and are trying to capture it. Indeed, there are more than 200 insurance companies present in Asia today, and the market is constantly seeing a stream of new entrants. So why do we believe that we will continue to be a winner? If I had to give you a one-word answer, I would say, distribution. Having quality and scale in distribution is an absolutely necessary condition, not sufficient, but certainly necessary. For our success in capturing the huge opportunity created by the emergent of this vast middle class. And our philosophy when it comes to distribution it's pretty straightforward and simple. We actually only have one model, it's face-to-face. We believe in face-to-face, needs-based selling and this can be done through 2 different channels: By our agents, or by our financial service consultants in partner bank branches. But fundamentally, it's the same commercial transaction taking place. So starting with agency. This channel, as you see here, is going from strength to strength. We now have over 280,000 agents in our sweet spot markets, and over a 5-year period from '08 to '13, we have tripled the number of agents in this market, while improving their productivity as measured by sales by Asia, by 31%.\r\nTriple agents, 31% more productive. This is why we believe that our agency force is a very significant competitive advantage in and by itself for us. And this is only the beginning. Very significant potential for a long-term sustainable growth of agency distribution in Asia. The education systems of the countries where we operate continue to produce vast numbers of motivated young graduates significantly in excess of our needs. And over the years to come, the multiplier effect of higher headcounts and constantly rising individual productivity will continue to drive higher levels of profitable growth for us allowing us to strengthen and deepen our competitive advantage in our well-established leader position.\r\nMoving away from agency, we remain very optimistic about the growth for our network of bank partners and policy. Banks are essential, at least to our strategy. But because of their long-term nature, they're an art, not a science. So we take a cautious approach. We have been getting lot of questions why don't you do more enough partners well, we take a cautious approach to choosing our partners because we know what it takes for such partnerships to be a truly successful. And we broadly follow 3 principles. The first one is that our partners must have a long-term commitment to our markets and be willing to invest to grow their franchise for good times and bad times just as we do, as that is the recipe for long-term success in Asia. We told you a number of times we're meeting with Asian officials and they tell us, well of course, you Prudential, you're different because in '97, '98, you didn't -- you stayed with us. That means a lot in the context where we operate. We do not want to go with people who will be flavor of the month push emerging markets when you're in another following year. That doesn't interest us. And that shrinks our universe. Second, our partners might be focused on building a successful business in the long term. That's really important. They are banks that understand that the value of a partnership is in building a large growing successful profitable business and in the revenue stream, but over time, this will generate. However, been trying to extract the largest up fund fee possible. These are really interesting fund fees, we'll have a later discussion on that fund fee. We look at the economics of it, it's a small fraction of the economics of the deal. There are banks that understand that and there's -- did you succeed or not. If I knew how long you have been able to build out your proper displays that's where income and revenue stream over 15 years, just for our 15 years versus an initial payment. Okay, so we're only interested in people who understand that because that's what we want we want to build a successful and sizable and material business together. And we believe that if I may dare get an analogy, a partnership is a bit like marriage and auctions are not a great way to choose a spouse. Our partners are banks that share our focus on performance and on the bottom line. But cultural alignment ensures that they will not ask us to do things that do not make sense such as selling products that are unprofitable for us. And frankly, to be candid, we had a few of those situations and we try to get out of it because it just doesn't make sense. You're constantly asked to give money away. That's not what our shareholders pay us for. Okay, and we don't like partners who say \"it will be great if you provided our customer with a product that has a minus 20% margin\", of course, I'm sure the customers will love it. But that's not what we do as a core business. And it's just a very unproductive setup, which just doesn't work in the long term. So these are the 3 principles we look at, and we apply these consistently and they guide us in selecting our partners. So you've seen UOB in 2010, Thanachart in 2012. These more recent partnerships are performing well. Sales at UOB have quadrupled, sales in inception in 2010. And when we used to talk to [indiscernible] the owner and leader, he would say what I love this life business and I'm convinced there is a huge potential there. I want you Prudential to come in and transform this business. Now that's music to our ears, okay? He never told how to check in, and he didn't care and he's really happy in here. I saw him in Singapore 2 months ago, really happy because the business has quadrupled. Trust me he makes much more money from that than from the initial check. Okay, Thanachart, I will come back later. Now our partnership with SCB is we believe the best example of why these principals matter. It has delivered significant growth since inception. Over the last decade, EPS grew by 19% CAGR and has been multiplied by 6x. And the most important fact about SCB is that in spite of all these growth, our penetration of the SCB customer base is 3%. So that is why we are happy to renew our agreement for another 15 years. The new deal we are announcing today provides huge headwind from growth. In a partnership with a proven track record these are not unproven or a startup between 2 new partners. That we've been working successfully with them for 15 years. So we know what we're buying. And here again, with 3% penetration, this pie will continue to grow faster than our ability to eat it. So we said distribution. The strength of our disruption, the quality of our product design allow us to deliver to customers our product at a very affordable cost. In this slide that you also saw in December, we show you the example of Indonesia to illustrate that we're able to provide health insurance coverage at an affordable cost, 5% of income here. So we've been able to grow strongly over a long period of time due to a combination of factor. I've talked about the strong and growing demand for savings and protection plans, so covered that just now. The unparalleled distribution power that we have in just over on that we'll right put it and a fourth factor, we knew which is our geographic diversification. And the resilience of these sales in '08, '09, when many predicted they would collapse. As well as our group since then are visible in this Slide.\r\nAnd before I leave the story, just to leave you with one statistic. You have seen in Q4 of '13, we did GBP 602 million of APE. In the all of 2005, we did GBP 568 million. So and that's not such a long time ago. So we did in Q4 of '13, more business than in the whole of 2005. So that's the kind of performance we've achieved at a regional level. So let me now use a few country examples. And I will talk about Indonesia, Hong Kong and Thailand. I am a little bit unfair to all of our territories where people are doing great things. But I'm sure you intend to have lunch, so I've only taken 3 countries. So let's start with Indonesia. Our Indonesian business is in great shape. We have a leading market position with over 197,000 agents. And it's always feel a bit dizzy after I say that. 197,000 agents in the country and access to greater and actually meant for those of you have been to -- who went to Jakarta, Rinaldi -- we also have Rinaldi in Indonesia. It's absolutely an amazing asset team in itself. An access to greater than 700 bank branches. In 2013, we continue to grow sales further. We have extended our reach across the country, and we showed you the maps outside Jakarta. We believe we're offering the right products, at the right time, to the right channels. And at this stage of the development, of that economy in that country demand for savings and protection products is actually very, very strong. And that is why we have achieved such high rider attachments to our policies, our savings and investment products. And as I showed you earlier, product is affordable, costing 5% of the customers income. So not only our products good value, we also provide high levels of customer service, our unique pool hospital friend, concierge service. Much appreciated by customers is now available at 3x more hospitals than in 2012. And we do that profitably in 2013 IFRS profit in Indonesia grew by 22% on a local currency basis. Demonstrating the strength of the fundamentals that are driving our business 25% on the local currency basis. Now that is all fine, but that is the past. And I know something about results for you, mostly interested in the future. So just to say a word about that. By 2013, the middle class in Indonesia, which is now 45 million. Okay, so we have a 1.9 million, 2 million customers out of 45 million is expected to grow to 135 million. So we are not at risk of running out of growth anytime soon in this market. And we will continue to focus on delivering quality products and services to a rapidly expanding customer base. Here, again, the pie will continue to grow faster than our ability to eat it. But not only are we growing in markets with low insurance penetration. We're also making strong progress in so-called and I insist on so-called, because that's not how we call them, mature markets as Hong Kong. Well, over the last 4 years, in these so-called mature markets, we have more than doubled IFRS operating profits in our life business by growing the scale of the business, acquiring new customers and at the same time, retaining existing customers. In 2013, our APE grew by 23% again in these so called mature market driven by increasing demand for our products, the increasing cases sold by agents as well as higher case sizes. It's one reason Standard Chartered Bank are currently so pleasing because it's very strong in Hong Kong and Hong Kong is a great place to be, quite frankly. The strength of our product and service proposition in Hong Kong allows us to achieve customer retention rates in the high 90s. It is directed to profitability. And it's a great place to be where we do very well. Moving on from Indonesia to Hong Kong to Thailand now, which is the second largest economy in Southeast Asia after Indonesia by GDP. Indonesia is about 300, Thailand is about 380. I told you in the past that we were frustrated that we didn't have a material business in Thailand. And that had been a gap in our original strategy. We're very pleased to say that we are now well on the way to achieving this. Our strategy in this market has been to improve our historically underweight position by strengthening our presence and that was deliberate in the fast-growing bancassurance channel as we knew that the agency channel was challenged and the statistic we see every month confirm that. Our partnership with Thanachart, which launched in May last year has simply transformed the scale of our business in a very short period. From integration, to execution, the local team has delivered the plan flawlessly, and we're very pleased that every single employee of Thanachart decided to join us. It was a great compliment. And the retail preparation to conduct it prior to the official close enabled us to sell our first policy on the first day of launch. As can be seen here, this has transformed the business. And we visit to all those countries, and I guess there always has to be the last one, but being to Thailand was always a bit challenging, because Thailand was simply 11th out of 11 countries. So you go there and try to motivate them. But they've jumped in one go from 11th to 6th, it's now a 6th largest country by profit in Asia in 1-year, and that is with only 8 months of contribution from Thanachart. So we'd like to get the business to compete once against the others so we see off Thailand is now it's more status in the PCA meeting. And at the rate it's growing, we're telling the top 4 with respect because great distribution with Thanachart. They're the fifth largest branch network in the country and it's great position to be. So we're very optimistic about the longer-term prospects in Thailand, despite -- and this is all despite the political turbulence that you have all seen in other countries in 2013. Now I've talked about the commercial success that we are enjoying in each of our countries. But the significant part of our story in Asia is also about the growing profit momentum in Asia, and that is growth is increasingly profit and cash rich. From this slide, you can see 2 distinct phase and I'm going to talk about the first phase first. '05 '07, from '05 '07 we are showing you in gray APE and in black, profit. APE grew by a lot, 86%. While unfortunately, IFRS profits over this period grew only by 2%. So it was a lot of growth, but without much profit or without much cash. And they will come to this point later. I'm sure we'll talk about the dividend, but it's very relevant. From 2008 to 2013, APE sales grew by 81% and IFRS profits quadruple. Now this change in the profit signature is the result of all the work being done by Barry, by his teams in each of our local businesses and our focus on delivering growth and caption. This does not exist before. And you can see the progress we have made in recent years, very clearly on this slide. In 2007, most of our businesses in the region, this shows you by profit born if you watch the countries, okay? Below GBP 50 million, GBP 50 million to GBP 200 million, above GBP 200 million of contribution in IFRS profit. In 2007, most of our businesses in the region were in the lower divisions. There were not generating material profits, and only one business, Singapore, generated more than GBP 50 million of earnings. That is not a long time ago. That's 2007, that's yesterday. 3 of our established businesses at the time, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, the old established businesses in the region, that then contributed 97% of PCA's earnings. So the risk did not exist in terms of profitability. 97% of the profit came from 3 countries.\r\nWe've made some progress since then. Our younger businesses is a completely transformed picture. Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines have together grown their profit 6x since 2007. Yes, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, aggregated, have grown their profit 6x since 2007. In the same period, profits from our more established businesses, the historic 3, I mentioned earlier, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, have actually trebled. So really we haven't done badly at all. We may have trebled, however, thanks to the growth of the rest of the portfolio, they now contribute less than half of our earnings. So when we talk about the diversification, that's what we mean. 3 businesses that used to constitute 97% of our profits, now constitute less than 50%, of a much higher total, because the total profits are also increased in that period. So this is our fundamental answer to those who sometimes are dismissive of the so-called smaller businesses. We have a proven track record of converting the so-called smaller businesses into material contributors over time. Now interestingly, 4 of PCA's local business units, take the top 4 there, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. If they were listed at U.K. life insurance P multiples, maybe a bit harsh, would be FTSE 100 contenders. But I believe with better profitable growth prospects than many life companies in the U.K. So just hold onto that first.\r\nWe are encouraged by many of our newer markets. It is, again, easy to be dismissive of the potential in markets like Myanmar or Cambodia. But we believe that, in time, they will follow on the same trajectory as the likes of Malaysia and Indonesia. Our tried and tested model is replicable and has been proven to work across Asia, and we've been able to transfer it again and again and again.\r\nNow in the next 2 slides that I've used before, but sorry, we making an important one, I just want to reuse it then, please bear with us. They illustrate a fundamental point, the resilience of our sales and the importance of our regulatory end product to our strategy, which is also directly linked to the quality of our distribution. You can only sell regular premium if you have a good sales force. First, single premiums. We know they are volatile across the economic cycle. They dominate in Western insurance markets making the sales of Western life companies are volatile and Asia is no exception. And you can see it on this chart, our single premium sales have been volatile. But the central point we want to make is that the regular premium product have tracked, in red here, have tracked over 2 decades since 1995, very much the middle class aggregate that I showed you earlier, that straight line. These regular premiums contribute, again, 90% of our sales. Regular premium contracts are an ideal vehicle for long-term savings and they remain a product of choice for Asian savers. They address perfectly their growing demand for savings and protection. And have them to make small, but regular contributions, to protect and save for themselves and their families, and Nic will have a few charts showing the flows in our business and you will see the contribution and the strength of that regular premium business to our numbers. And this largely explains why our sales have been resilient across so many economic cycles. But again, in spite of all this growth, the potential for further growth remains very significant as the penetration of these products for which demand is strong, is still low. So this pie will continue to grow faster than our ability to eat it.\r\nNow we often talk about our financial numbers and performance and emphasize it, but financials are only a convenient representation of reality, of what we do, which is to capture a historic opportunity through disciplined execution. We believe that the trajectories shown on these charts can continue long into the future. We have the right team to deliver sustainable long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. Now let me illustrate this point by giving you an insight into how we think internally about our newer markets' long-term prospects.\r\nNow this slide shows you some of the key outputs of one of our internal business plans for one of our smaller markets. Really small. When I say small, you can see here 1,100 agents, 6,000 customers -- sorry for nothing, more than 15,000 policies and APE of GBP 1 million. Now we believe that over the next 15 years, in this market, we will multiply our agency sales force by 100 -- 150x to 200x, grow our customer base by 300x to 400x and issue more than 150x to 200x of policies today in the process, of course, growing this market's APE by 400x to 500x. Now it's still early in the morning, but I know many of you, at this point, are you thinking that this looks crazy. And that you're looking at a slightly deranged financial team.\r\nWell, now, here's a fact. I'm afraid I misled you slightly involuntarily. This slide is not about the future, but about the past. It's not a projection, it's a natural result. We have delivered this performance and the market where we have done this, as you know, is Indonesia. You go 15 years from today, 1998, you realized the amazing transformation that this business has undergone. And this has been repeated by us in other markets in Asia, time and time again. So my apologies for the teasing, but really, this is making an important point. Because we face that disbelief, that skepticism, time and time again when we talk about those exponential curves and the power of compounding. All the mathematicians in the world know the power of compounding. But the human mind can't convert the 0.40 CAGR in 160x. It's just an operation we don't do very well. So that's what we want to illustrate here. We believe we have a proven formula for driving profitable growth. We believe we can replicate our historic success in new markets, while continuing to drive our existing operations to new heights. So why don't we have fun here in this slide. It's a picture of Indonesia at 2 points in time, 14 years apart. Central point, 1998 and then, 2012. You can see here, life insurance premiums have gone up 4x, GBP 2.6 billion to GBP 10.2 billion. But the life insurance penetration is still quite low. After this phenomenal growth that I've showed you, whoa, you're going to run out room, you got to slow down, blah, blah, blah. We have a lot more to go for here. Penetration is barely above 1%. So the pie is growing faster than our ability to eat it. I'll 'repeat it 10x today. That's all you need to understand about the Asian business, the pie is growing faster than our ability to eat it. So stop worrying about how much we're going to eat. Our problem is not to get an indigestion. There's so much pie, that, really, the issue is not, is there enough pie? It's stay disciplined, don't go to fast, that's my firm, this gentleman over there. Say, we go twice faster. It's really about maintaining the quality of the growth and the quality of the distribution. So that we build, not on sand, but we build on solid foundations and we have a profitable sustainable business going into the future.\r\nSo the big 3 examples. We can replicate this in Thailand, I've showed you, we're nowhere, we're #9 the small market share. In the Philippines, we have -- we have a number of chances with 8,000 agents now? Yes? 8,460, something like that, the number changes everyday. And in Myanmar, where we don't even have a business. We can replicate this success and just note, that these 3 countries, when there are worries for potential for growth in Asia, have the same population as Indonesia, all right? So we believe that the long-term potential in these markets, in terms of absolute size, is often underestimated. Each of these countries in 10 years from now will be very material for us, whoever is standing here and giving this presentation, take the commitment.\r\nOur 2017 objectives, which we are absolutely focused on delivering, our milestone on this journey. However, the journey will not end in 2017. We aim to deliver that same profitable growth trajectory for well beyond the period that most observers habitually forecast. So to summarize and conclude in Asia, there's 2 messages. One, It's obvious that there are a few short-term challenges for a number of the economies, but we believe, that the fundamental drivers we talked about this morning are intact and that this pie will continue to grow faster in our ability to eat it and for a long time. Two, we are in the unique position to take advantage of a significant opportunity, thanks to the growing scale and quality of our distribution, our main competitive advantage. And thanks to our focus, more importantly, on the execution and delivery and to the quality of our teams. So much for Asia.\r\nLet me now move to the U.S.. Jackson continues to be one of the strongest players in the U.S. life insurance industry. And has delivered high returns on equity while maintaining a conservative balance sheet. The success that we have enjoyed in the VA industry results from the discipline with which we have implemented our strategy and from our focus on writing only value creating business at every point in the cycle. And that has led us, over time, to very interesting discussions at these presentations and that's the central point, writing only value creating business at every point in the cycle. One way to demonstrate the quality of Jackson's in-force book of policies is to look at the vintages based on the equity market levels, as levered by the S&P 500, at which your business was written. As you can see here, over 2/3 of our book was written at levels below 1,400 of the S&P. So 25% lower than current levels. Importantly, our customers are happy. They have seen their account values grow. In 2013 alone, their average account value grew by 23%, and it is a good rule of thumb, in insurance, that delivering value to customers avoids adverse policyholder behavior. Jackson continues to innovate and the growth of Elite Access to over GBP 4 billion of premiums in 2013, has pushed the contribution of nonliving benefit VAs, in red here, to over 30% of total VA sales. The combination of the pricing changes we've done almost every quarter and also in 2013, the rise in long-term interest rates at the end of the year, have pushed our new business margins higher. As shown on the slide, overall margins on VA are at 76%. However, just keep in mind that these margins here from one year to another on this chart, are not entirely comparable because the  product mix has evolved significantly in the period due to the rapid growth of Elite Access in the last couple of years. Within the 76%, margins on our guaranteed variable annuity products are at an all-time high. Which is why we are very comfortable writing this business today, in volume. The long term consistent approach that Jackson has taken to the annuity industry in the U.S. means that it is now generating sustainable and significant cash remittances for shareholders which is our ultimate yardstick across the group and across [indiscernible].  So undeniably a good performance from Jackson and thank you, Mike.\r\nSo let's now move to the U.K. And there, we'll talk about U.K. Life, and then, M&G. As we showed at the investor conference in December, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid from now on, I'm going to have to use this chart every time I talk about the U.K. life sector. The industry has been generating significant net outflows for the last 5 years. And Nic will come back to that in his chart, regarding our assets, equivalent to almost 14% of industry's assets under management. These assets have largely been flowing to the asset management industry, which has provided simple transparent                                           savings product that meets customer demand. Our strategy, therefore, in shrinking market is to focus on a few products for us for profitable where we have a clear competitive advantage and can deliver genuine value to customers and shareholders. As the left-hand-side chart on this slide shows with-profit product has delivered strong returns over the last 10 years, outperforming its benchmark quite significantly by 49%. This out-performance has translated into good returns for our policyholders with cumulative policies paid over the last 10 years of over GBP 22 billion, as you can see here on the right. And the with-profit capital position remains strong at the end of the year, 2013, and inherited estate was GBP 8 billion. Now moving onto retail annuities. Of course, a lot of attention has been devoted to annuities in the run-up through a thematic review published by VFC [ph] last month. We were, of course, as you would imagine, closely involved in the review work and we support fully the SCA's efforts improve the functioning of the annuities markets. This is a key and important and core product for our pension system and for our economy. No doubt about it. Prudential's annuity product position, actually, we believe, is strong. The chart on this slide shows you some data. The speed of a retail annuity APE in 2013, by type of annuity provided to our customers, just like to make a few points here. First, 37% of our annuity APE comes from the external market. In other words, from customers, who have shopped around and decided to buy an annuity from for Prudential because of the competitiveness of our offering. Second, our enhanced annuity proposition and probably we haven't talked about it enough, is doing well and has grown by 12% in 2013. Good growth. So again, I'm not saying that there's no growth in the U.K., there are issues, there are signals, but if you want, you can grow and profit. And third, of the remaining 60%, okay, if you have 37 and 6, anyway, the remaining 60% of those policies of annuity APE that comes from our existing pension customers, a majority of these, so that's 60%, internal, 80% either have variable guarantees, buy our market-leading with-profit annuities, which have the Income Choice Annuity, which gives them a choice to either take some cash, or take an annuity. Qualify for enhanced annuities or have pension puts less than GBP 30,000 where our rates are quite competitive, and we were quite competitive there because these are people we know well and we feel very comfortable pricing their longevity. When we get outside business, we're always worried about the entire selection and we're just more causes in pricing. And would be great if you can move the debate, probably debate away from pricing because of there are many, many other criteria in buying an annuity. And I'm sure, we've talked about it. But the business runs on numbers, if you look at the value of the embedded guarantee, that guarantees the options, in the old Man from the Pru, followed the people but it's very significant. In the examples I've seen, that the -- valuing that option, they're getting 18% to 50% more value than the average external market price. That's the untold story. Okay? So the 60% of the people are investing internally, we can absolutely demonstrate that 80% are getting a better deal internally than would get from the marketplace. We have all the data, very confident taking that challenge. So on average, our internal customers -- sorry, are not stupid. They shop around, about 80% of them do. They're very aware of the open market option. They make a rational, conscious decision, which, actually, we believe is the right decision, because we have data to support it. They take the best deal for them. This, after 20 years with the Pru, stay with the Pru. And we, actually, give our internal customers annuity rates that are higher than those are available externally. That's the position of this company. So we welcome the FCA thematic review and we're working closely with the regulator and other stakeholders to deliver the best outcome for our customers. Clearly, there are issues there, for instance, we're below 10,000 puts. Yes, there is something to be done there, probably so ABI [ph] made a statement, Monday, about that. There are things that need to be improved. We're not sitting -- standing here, saying, oh, everything's perfect, no. But we're just saying, we need to keep the firm in proportion, and this business has been run very responsibly.\r\nNow like every part of the group, we remain focused on cash generation and the U.K. has done well in that respect in the challenging, again, environment, continuing to deliver tangible value to shareholders as you can see here. In 2013, the U.K. remitted GBP 355 million of cash, it's nothing to sneeze at, achieving its objective of the delivering GBP 350 million by 2013, as we had announced at the investor conference in December. You will remember that Jackie shared with you, in December, again, her early thoughts on the business. She is reporting to the board in the second quarter on the conclusions of her review and we will share any relevant conclusions with you in due course, but to be clear, what you should expect is evolution, not revolution, as Jackie made clear in December in her presentation.\r\nMoving onto M&G, which is where we've seen more growth in the U.K. M&G has grown from its roots as a U.K.-only asset manager to building a large diversified business over the last decade. You can see the results of this strategy on this slide. M&G has not only continued to grow in its home market with retail FUM, funds under management, in the U.K. more than trebling in the last 5 years, but it has also been able to diversify successfully into Europe, where funds under management have grown by almost 8x, 7.60x. This has led to total external retail assets under management growing by 3.5x with higher-margin external assets currently accounting for more than half of the total funds under management, a rare position for an insurance company. This geographic diversification has gone hand-in-hand with diversification, both by asset class and by type of client. As you can see here on the right, the external funds under management is roughly split equally between retail, shown at the top, and institutional, shown at the bottom, with good diversification between equities and fixed income and other asset classes. This lends resilience to the business and positions M&G well, we believe, to perform across economic and market cycles. Underpinning this success is, of course, strong investment performance. And by December '13, 69% of retail funds under management were above median, over a 3-year period, which we believe is an appropriate period to judge performance. And 100% of the institutional segregated fixed income funds were above their respective benchmarks. The successful execution of M&G strategy has resulted in IFRS profits growing by 1.7x over the last 5 years. So here, almost doubling over 5 years. So if I daresay so, Michael and his team have generated Asia-like performance in the European context.\r\nIn 2014, M&G's IFRS operating profit grew by 23%, driven primarily by a 22% increase in external retail funds under management. I will just stop here and say a few words. I know, I'm in the U.K. section but I just to say a few words about the Eastspring and asset management in Asia. Eastspring is also making good progress in delivered IFRS profits, which are 9% higher, in constant currency terms, over -- year-over-year. We are focused on building organically a world-class pan-Asian asset management and we remain a leader in our industry in that respect. Our entry for asset management into newer markets where we already have significant life business expertise, such as Indonesia, augurs well for our future growth in asset management across the region. Let me now turn -- in the final section to the operating performance of our 4 business units and how it has translated, over time, into returns, into growth and cash for shareholders.\r\nOver the last 6 years, and you're familiar with this slide, free surplus generation, our key measure of cash, as you know, kind of looks like -- a key measure of cash, as you know, has more than doubled, and dividend payments have more than tripled. And today's up for dividend re-base is the direct result of a strong operating and financial performance of the group. Now I do not want you, please, to read too much into a sequential upwards re-basis of our dividend over the last 2 years. This reflects the strong financial performance of the group in that period. Our dividend policy remains unchanged. We aim to pay a progressive dividend and of the board will consider a periodic re-base, if and only if, and when we can demonstrate a capital and cash headroom following our internal and stringent stress test and those really cover a range of criteria. So we're actually very stringent and not -- do not just look at one metric.\r\nSo with that, let me now hand over to Nic who will take you through our 2013 results in more detail.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Nicolaos Nicandrou (Executives)】\nThank you, Tidjane. And good morning, everyone. Just about, good morning. In my presentation. I will provide you with a detailed look at the drivers of our performance in 2013, with a particular focus on IFRS profit and free surplus generation, the 2 measures that underpin our new 2017 financial objectives. I will also give you an update on our balance sheet and take you through the new economic capital information.\r\nStarting with the financial headlines. We have delivered a strong performance in 2013, building on the positive momentum of 2012 and accelerating through the second half of the year. Our disciplined execution has enabled us to report double-digit increases in all of the profitability metrics shown on this slide. So as you can see, in 2013, new business profit increased by 16%. IFRS operating profit was up by 17%, with all geographic regions delivering over GBP 1 billion for the first time. Embedded value operating profit rose by 29% and free surplus generation was also higher by 18%.\r\nThe growth that we have enjoyed over the last few years in Asia and the U.S. means that the proportion of the 2013 results transacted in sterling, ranges between 10% and 40% of each total, depending on the metric. Sterling appreciated markedly in the second half of 2013, but the use of average exchange rates means that the translational effect on our reported results is relatively muted at between 0 and minus 2%. And I will come back to this shortly. Working in the other direction, though, our operating results of benefited from rises in both equity markets and long-term yields. We saw this effect come through the half year numbers and this tailwind persisted through the rest of 2013. Now I will point out the areas where this is most pronounced, as I step through the presentation.\r\nLooking at the contribution to each financial metric from our 4 businesses, you can see that the 2013 improvement has been broad-based. In presenting this slide, I remove the currency distortions in order to give you a clean underlying business performance. Asia has delivered a strong double-digit growth across all measures, highlighting, again, the benefit of our focus on regular premium business with a strong bias towards health and protection, which is less prone to market movements and is underpinned by the favorable long-term structural trends that Tidjane has already outlined. Our U.S. business has delivered another excellent trading performance reflecting the more positive investment markets and economic conditions. These improved results were achieved while managing both the size and mix of VA new business sales, reflecting our approach to balancing value, volume, risk and capital generation at this point in the economic cycle. In a year of considerable market disruption, our focus in the U.K. on value and cash generation over volume has seen us sustain our IFRS profits and grow free surplus generation.\r\nFinally, M&G continues its strong track record of attracting flows and this has driven increases in funds under management, earnings and cash. Our overall performance in 2013 demonstrates the quality of our new business franchise, the resilience of our in-force book and our ability to deliver growth in both earnings and cash. I want to deal with the currency translation effect early in my presentation, as I know this is front of mind for many of you. I mentioned earlier, that we use average exchange rates to translate our local currency results into sterling and that this convention has only had a muted effect in 2013. The full impact of the currency falls that we experienced in 2013 will progressively come through the reported 2014 sterling results. It is difficult to predict what the actual impact will be, as we will only know this as we move through 2014. So what I have illustrated on this slide is the effect that using year-end spot rates would have on our 2013 IFRS and free surplus results, which would have been 6% and 5%, respectively. As the pie charts illustrate, the group's overall reported results are mostly exposed to U.S. dollar currency movements. This is also true of Asia results, where the largest contribution comes from countries whose currencies are either directly pegged or managed by reference to U.S. dollars. Please bear in mind that our exposure to foreign currency is purely translational, reporting the fact that we report our results in sterling. We are appropriately focused on earning local currency businesses in each of our markets and we do not take any transactional cross-currency exposure. As Tidjane has already said, we believe that in the long term, our exposure to currencies in high GDP growth countries will be a source of future value for our business. With that covered, I will now move to our 2013 results, starting with IFRS.\r\nOur IFRS operating profit from Asia has exceeded the GBP 1 billion level for the first time, excluding the one-off gain flagged last year from the sale in our stake in China Life of Taiwan. Asia's reported IFRS life profit was up 17% or 20% on a constant exchange rates. Life profits have benefited from strong contributions by the faster growing markets in Southeast Asia. Taken together, our 4 largest businesses in Indonesia, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, delivered double-digit growth, producing GBP 748 million of IFRS profit, exceeding the contribution from our U.K. life business for the first time.\r\nOur smaller fast-growing businesses in Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam have also made encouraging progress during 2013. On a combined basis, they accounted for over half of the increase in Asia's life profits, contributing 12% of the total, up from 6% the previous year. We continue to grow the scale of our life book in Asia, which we measure by reference to policyholder liabilities, as shown on the chart in the top right in your books.\r\nDuring 2013, the addition of another sizable cohort of regular premium policies, combined with a lower exit rate from in-force, has generated net life inflows of GBP 2.3 billion equivalent to 12% of opening reserves. This is a new high and it is the first time since the crisis that we have seen net inflows above the GBP 2 billion level. What this shows is that in a year where many commentators have expressed fears about the economic outlook for emerging markets, customer behavior on the ground has not been impacted. If anything, retention improved in 2013, as illustrated in the slides charting the surrender and partial withdrawal rates, that are included in the appendix. Invested market and other movements have been net positive contributing further to the growth of our book. While in local currency terms, the stock of the liabilities is not impacted, you can see at the chart the effect of translating this back into sterling. So the dynamic that I have referred to before, of focusing our sales effort on new regular premium business, with a sizable health and protection content, sold to a very sticky customer base is evident, once again.\r\nTurning to the chart in the bottom right. Life income has grown by 14% at constant exchange rates reflecting both the larger scale and the high return nature of Asia's business. Costs have also grown, but at slower rate of 11%. If we now look at Asia's life business performance in more detail, the sources of earnings analysis shown here, confirms most of the key messages from our previous slide. Technical and other margin, shown in the middle, remains a dominant feature of Asia's life income. Within this category, insurance margin grew by 15% to GBP 679 million, reflecting strong growth in health and protection business and a contribution of positive claims experience. Marginal revenue is also higher at GBP 1,562 million. I would remind you that deferral and amortization of acquisition costs is not a significant feature of our Asia results, which means that our accounting earnings are very close to cash earnings.\r\nTurning to the U.S., IFRS operating profit was strongly up at GBP 1.3 billion, driven by a 29% increase in the life result. The 2013 results include a full year contribution from REALIC of GBP 128 million, which compares to GBP 67 million in the previous year. Excluding REALIC, the improvement in the result is primarily due to higher fee income, which has benefited from strong growth in variable annuity account balances. The growth in the scale of Jackson's business is illustrated, again, on the chart in the top right in your books. Policyholders' liabilities have increased to GBP 107.4 billion as net life inflows contributed GBP 9.6 billion. This is the fifth year in a row that life net inflows, in other words, the component that we control, have added more than 10 percentage points of growth to the stock of opening reserves. The strong S&P 500 rally in 2013 contributed a further GBP 8.2 billion. As was the case for Asia, the currency translation effect is only relevant to sterling reporting purposes. As well as being best-in-class from a service perspective, Jackson's operating platform is both scalable and efficient. The benefit of this is evident on the chart in the bottom right, where the positive JAWS [ph] effect is clear with revenues -- revenue continuing to grow at a faster rate than expenses. Turning to the detailed sources of earnings analysis for the U.S., I would like to draw your attention to 3 areas: Firstly, fee income, which has grown by 34% to GBP 1,172 million, in line with the 35% growth in average separate  account balances. Fees are marginally lower due to the increased proportion of Elite Access, which has a lower M&E fee. Secondly, insurance margin, which has grown to GBP 588 million reflecting the extra contribution from REALIC's term insurance business, which is delivering the objective of both growing and diversifying Jackson's earnings. Thirdly, spread profits, which are marginally higher at GBP 730 million, as we maintain their overall spread margin through crediting rate actions. We continue to anticipate that spreads will tend towards the 200 basis point level in the near term.  We are pleased with the evolution of the shape of Jackson's sources of income, which is delivering improvements in both the quality and the resilience of its earnings.\r\nMoving to the U.K., IFRS operating profit was in line with the previous year at GBP 735 million. The chart, on the left, analyzes the results between what I would call the underlying retail life result in red, the contribution from bulks, the general insurance commission and the one-off profit from the longevity swap we executed earlier in the year. The overall result continues to be driven by our focus on with-profits and annuities. The main change between the 2 years is the lower shareholder transfer from with-profits reflecting the reduction in bonuses. In 2013, life inflows for our shareholder backed business remain negative and have been mitigated but positive investment market movements. The with-profits picture, if I had put that one up would be similar, and both are consistent with the transfers we have observed for the number of years in the U.K. life sector that Tidjane has already illustrated. Now despite these trends, as you can see in the bottom right, we have defended our overall level -- our overall life income levels by focusing on those parts of the market where returns are most attractive and by being disciplined about our new business economics. Expenses, as you can see, were 4% lower.\r\nAs I have said before, genuinely attractive investment opportunities are more limited in the U.K. life sector relative to other parts of the business, and this will continue to place downward pressure on our earnings prospects. We remain comfortable with this as it does not detract from the important role that the U.K. plays in our group.\r\nTurning to M&G, IFRS operating profit was 23% higher at GBP 395 million. This strong performance reflects the growth and the scale of the retail business, which is our most profitable segment.\r\nFor M&G, the key driver of earnings is the growth in external funds under management. As you can see in this chart, external funds under management are up 13%, reflecting net inflows totaling GBP 9.5 billion and the positive effect of investment market movements, which have added a further GBP 4.6 billion.\r\nTotal external funds under management of GBP 126 billion at the end of 2013 represent a new high and our testament to M&G's track record of positive net inflows for the 11th year in a row.\r\nThe growth in funds under management has been achieved principally in the retail segment where fee income is highest. As Tidjane has already explained, retail funds under management were 22% higher in 2013, underpinned by a strong sales performance in Europe. The success in retail has driven an 18% increase in underlying fee revenues, which you can see on the chart in the bottom right.\r\nAs I indicated this time last year, we're making additional investments in 2013 and 2014 in scaling up the infrastructure of M&G's business. Reflecting this investment, M&G's total costs are higher, but the effect has been absorbed by the increase in revenue, leaving the total cost income ratio unchanged at 59% year-on-year.\r\nI will now move to free surplus, the measure that we use to track cash generation in our business. Starting with the table on the left, our life in-force profit and asset management businesses have generated GBP 3,099 million of free surplus in 2013, representing a 15% increase over 2012.\r\nNow this figure was around GBP 1 billion in 2005. It reached GBP 2 billion in 2009 and has now exceeded GBP 3 billion.\r\nIn other words, we have added GBP 1 billion every 4 years. It is our ability to grow free surplus through writing high return, fast payback new business that distinguishes Prudential's business model from that of others.\r\nWe continue to take actions to optimize capital consumption and have invested GBP 637 million in 2013 to write new business. This is 3% higher than 2012, reflecting the combination of pricing actions, changes in business mix and the favorable impact of the rising yields through the year. On the right, we analyze the contribution of each business. And as you can see, all 4 businesses are making significant and growing contributions to the total.\r\nMy next slide shows how this cash generation has impacted the stock of free surplus and central cash.\r\nStarting on the left, the net free surplus generated in 2013 helps absorb the negative GBP 807 million impact of market movements, including a negative GBP 200 million currency effect and funded cash remittances to group, totaling GBP 1,341 million, representing an increase of 12%. This leaves some GBP 4 billion of free surplus stock, which we can either deploy to finance future growth or can act as a buffer against future economic shocks. As we said in December, over the last few years, we have managed our internal remittance ratio within a corridor. We believe that it is appropriate to retain the flexibility that a range affords, leaving scope to manage the group for fluctuations in economic cycle and to pursue business opportunities. You can see how these remittances have impacted central cash on the right, which, after deducting several costs and external dividends and adding the net proceeds from hybrid insurances, meant that we closed 2013 at GBP 2.2 billion, which is a healthy position.\r\nBefore leaving this topic, I wanted to reemphasize the reliability of future free surplus generation by updating you on the undiscounted monetization profile of our life operations.\r\nBy now, you will be familiar with these charts. The dark blue bars in the top chart represent the end 2012 life in-force monetization profile as we reported a year ago. The light blue bars represent the updated profile of the end 2012 block of business one year later. These bars are now higher than before, reflecting the positive impact of rises in yields between the 2 periods, which have compensated for the negative currency translation effect.\r\nNow when we add the cash flows from the 2013 new business cohort shown in red, we have an overall profile that is higher than the one we started with, evidence of the powerful capital dynamics of our business model.\r\nI will now cover briefly the EEV basis results before turning to capital. On this basis, life operating profit was up 27% to 5,639 million. As you can see in the chart on the left, the improvement is broad based and is equivalent to a return on opening embedded value of 19%. We estimate that the rise in long-term yields experienced in 2013 has contributed some GBP 450 million to this total.\r\nThe chart on the right summarizes the contribution from new and in-force business. New business profit was up 16%, and I will come back to this shortly. In-force profit was 42% higher at nearly GBP 2.8 billion. As shown in the breakout box, the increase reflects a combination of growth in the book, favorable variances and the beneficial effect of higher long-term interest rates. The latter point is evident in the numbers labeled unwind. Approximately, GBP 250 million of the increase in 2013 relates to the positive gearing from the rise in long-term yields.\r\nIn 2011 and 2012, when interest rates were falling, I flagged that the unwind had been negatively impacted by GBP 200 million and GBP 83 million, respectively. Therefore, while interest rates are not yet back to 2010 levels, we have recouped most of the drag that we experienced in the unwind on the way down. The drivers of the positive experience variances and assumption changes are summarized on this slide.\r\nIn Asia, all factors including persistency, mortality, morbidity, have remained in positive territory, in line with recent trends. This provides yet more evidence that customer behavior has not been impacted by the macroeconomic concerns.\r\nIn the U.S, we have seen a continuation of positive -- of the positive contribution from spread, reflecting the success of the actions taken by management to mitigate the low interest rate risk. Other items include favorable persistency of GBP 134 million, which reinforces our prudent approach to assumption setting and to pricing.\r\nIn the U.K, both years benefited from the effect of the reductions in U.K. corporation tax rates. The contribution from other is distorted by one-off items, but the underlying position is positive in both years.\r\nPositive experience has been a regular feature of our results since the crisis, a period characterized by significant global macroeconomic uncertainty and market volatility.  Our strong performance here confirms both the quality and the resilience of our franchise.\r\nNew business profits, shown on this next slide, grew by 16% to GBP 2,843 million. The table on the right analyzes the drivers of this growth, with volume, pricing and mix contributing 9 percentage points of the increase; and higher long-term yields, a further 8 points.\r\nAll 3 regions continued to write new business at internal rates of return of more than 20% with short payback periods. In Asia, new business profit was 15% higher at GBP 1,460 million. At constant exchange rates, the increase was 19%, with both agency and bank channels growing NBP at similar pace.\r\nThe improved profitability reflects the growth in our 7 sweet spot markets where NBP was 21% higher, driven by health and protection. The rise in yields had a small positive overall effect on NBP, reflect -- benefiting Hong Kong due to its bias towards savings products and dampening Indonesia due its focus on protection, which attracts a lower EEV valuation at higher interest rates even though the profit signature is unaffected.\r\nIn the U.S., NBP increased by 24% to GBP 1,086 million. Within this number, the contribution from variable annuities increased from GBP 809 million to GBP 1,023 million. This is despite the 7% decline in sales of VAs with guarantees, the negative effect of which was counted by the positive effect of product and pricing actions; the contribution from elite access; and the beneficial impact of the 130 basis points increase in treasury yields, which added GBP 150 million to the U.S. NBP.\r\nU.K. retail NBP was 3% lower. This is despite the 12% reduction in retail sales, the effect of which was mostly compensated by pricing and product actions and improvements in mix. The economics of the business sold in the U.K. are extremely attractive when you consider that this NBP was delivered by investing GBP 29 million of capital.\r\nMoving now to the rest of the profit and loss account for both IFRS and EEV. In my interim results presentation, I walked you through the mechanics of the IFRS accounting mismatch that is generated from Jackson's hedges when equity markets rise. I will not repeat the explanation beyond reminding you that this arises because hedges are fully mark-to-market and liabilities are mostly marked to cost. Equity markets rallied further since June, so the negative effect of accounting mismatch reoccurred in the second half of the year, although the impact was more subdued. We remain committed to our approach of hedging on an economic basis and are happy to accept the volatility in the accounting results that ensues. In addition, the further rises in interest rates in the second half generated some more negative value movements on our holdings of fixed income securities. Under IFRS, this come through investment variances and unrealized losses on AFS securities. And as you can see, the impact compared to the first half was also much reduced.\r\nThe most significant effect in the second half was the negative GBP 0.4 billion arising from translating our U.S. and Asia IFRS net assets at the year-end exchange rates.\r\nOverall, the strength of our operating performance in the second half has been sufficient to absorb all these factors. So after deducting the interim dividend, our IFRS shareholders' equity is slightly higher at GBP 9.7 billion compared to June 2013.\r\nOn EEV, investment variances are positive in both halves, reflecting our ability to recognize on this basis the full economic benefit of the improved market returns. Profits for the period, therefore, accelerated in the second half and were only partially offset by the negative currency translation effect of GBP 1.8 billion.\r\nNonetheless, the strength of our operating performance was such that retained earnings boosted our shareholders' funds by 93p over the course of 2013 to 971p per share.\r\nI have provided you on this slide the usual update on the balance sheet. In short, the overall picture is unchanged. We remain well capitalized and defensively positioned. All of our key underlying solvency metrics have improved. The with-profits estate stood at GBP 8 billion at the end of 2013.\r\nAt the start of 2014, following the completion of our domestication product, some GBP 1.2 billion of the estate was transferred to the newly created Hong Kong life entity, leaving both funds well capitalized. The U.S. RBC ratio has improved to 450%, which attests to Jackson's disciplined approach to managing its capital base. Our stance on hedging our U.S. variable annuity exposures is unchanged, and the $1.3 billion fees that we will levy for providing guarantees in 2014 provides an ample budget to hedge.\r\nWe have updated the information relating to Jackson's capital formation, capital sensitivities to shocks and customer behavior and have included these in the appendix to your slides.\r\nIn my remaining slides, I set out a summary of the group's economic capital position based on our current Solvency II internal model.\r\nWe're still 2 years away from having to adopt Solvency II and, notwithstanding the Omnibus II breakthrough, further clarity is needed in a number of areas, which will be provided when the level 2 and level 3 guidance is finalized. Furthermore, the PRA has not reviewed and approved our internal model, and this is a further source of uncertainty. All this to say that these results should be viewed as highly indicative and subject to change but provide you with a first view of Prudential's solvency position on a risk-sensitive basis.\r\nThe key assumptions underpinning the calculations are shown on this slide and are set out in more detail in your -- in a new section that we've created in your packs. The results assume U.S. equivalent, incorporating Jackson's surplus over the 250% RBC level, consistent with our approach to free surplus reporting. The 250% level is informed by the results of our internal multi-year economic capital model, which we believe provides a good proxy for the risk capital that we need to carry in this business. Furthermore, the results do not reflect the matching adjusting -- adjustment concept for U.K. annuities, pending further development of the calibration at European level and a decision on whether certain types of securities will be excluded.\r\nAs you can see, the economic capital surplus at the end of 2013 is GBP 11.3 billion, equivalent to a cover of 257%. The level of required capital of GBP 7.2 billion, shown in blue, represents the risk capital needed to withstand a 1 in 200-year event over a 1-year time horizon.\r\nAvailable capital of GBP 18.5 billion, shown in red, represents a more economic view of our group's resources, removing unnecessary prudence from our Solvency I basis technical provisions and disapplying asset valuation restrictions.\r\nThe top chart on this next slide provides you with analysis of the risk profile of our business under this new basis. Around half of the group's undiversified risk capital requirement relates to market risk, shown in the red segments in the pie, and the other half to non-market risks, shown in the blue and green segments. The group's most material market risk exposures are to credit risk, principally from the U.K. and Jackson fixed annuity portfolios; and to equity markets mainly from with-profit shareholder transfers in the U.K. and the fund-related charges in Asia. The group's most material non-market risk exposure is to lapse mortality and morbidity risk in Asia and to longevity risk on U.K. annuities.\r\nAs you can see, our overall profile is not highly concentrated to any particular risk type. Our modeling shows that some 54% of risks diversify away. And in line with the Solvency II guidance on U.S. equivalent, no credit has been taken for the diversification of benefits between our U.S. business and the rest of the group.\r\nThe chart at the bottom of the slide shows the sensitivity to the end 2013 economic capital position to a variety of market shocks. The key message here is that the balance of our risks is such that the impact of these shocks is manageable. So the resilience of the business model, now something that we have commented on in the past by reference to other metrics, is also evident through this risk-sensitive measure.\r\nMy final slide on the topic analyzes the movement in the estimated surplus during 2013. I will let you study this analysis at your leisure, but the key takeaways are: one, that the group's operations generated 31 percentage points of solvency cover in 2013; that higher equity markets and rises in long-term yields have contributed a further 12 points of cover; and that all the other effects have broadly netted out.  The fact that at an operating level flow is positive should not be a surprise to you.\r\nWe write low-strain, high-return, fast-payback business, so the capital generation dynamics should be positive irrespective of the accounting or solvency lens that you may choose to use to assess this. The fact that the stock kick is high should also not be a surprise as a large component of our book in Asia is health and protection, which is Solvency II-friendly.\r\nIn addition, the stock includes the shareholders' interest in future with-profit transfers, which is sizable, reflecting the scale of the business. I want to emphasize that economic capital is one of a number of financial metrics that we use to run our business and that it is no more or no less important than other metrics. While this information is new for the market, it is not new for us, and I have been -- and we have been using aspects of economic capital alongside other financial measures to inform our day-to-day decisions.\r\nTherefore, what you should take from this is the fact that it reaffirms what we have always said about the positive cash and capital dynamics of our business.\r\nSo by way of concluding remarks, I would like to iterate: one, that the strength of our overall performance in 2013 -- to highlight the strength of our overall performance, which demonstrates the quality of the new business franchise and the resilience of our in-force book and also our ability to continue to deliver to grow -- to deliver growth both in earnings and cash; and two, the improvement in  our capital buffers, reflecting both the strong operational performance and the investment market tailwinds.\r\nWith that, I will now hand you back to Tidjane.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nThank you. Thank you, Nic. So to summarize on 2013, the group has delivered a strong performance with double-digit increases in all our key metrics, as Nic just showed you, and has been able to achieve all our 2013 growth and cash objectives.\r\nOur performance during the 2008 to 2013 period, which culminated in the delivery of our 2013 objectives, has allowed us to transform the financial characteristics of the group, which has now a high-quality and growing earnings base, with all 4 business units contributing materially to cash. This newly acquired diversity of cash and earnings is a key source of strength for the group. This is what has allowed the board, led by the Chairman here this morning, to declare a 15% upwards rebate of our 2014 full year dividend.\r\nOur dividend policy remains unchanged, and we aim to provide a growing dividend to shareholders in a sustainable and prudent manner. Asia remains core to the group's future prospects, but tailwinds of favorable long-term structural trends, a leading business platform and best-in-class execution position us well to deliver an enduring value for both customers and shareholders. Now this is all good news, but I want to reiterate that we are not complacent.\r\nActually, paranoia and competitiveness are very well shared features in this group, and I don't think Jackie has changed that profile. He just joined us.\r\nSo we have embarked on a new set of objectives after delivering the equally challenging 2013 objectives. The group has tremendous growth opportunities. We have the platform, the ability and the discipline to deliver on these opportunities and to create value for both our customers and our shareholders. We are in the right markets, so in the right place, at the right time. And if you allow me a bad joke here, a lot of people talk about being in the right place at the right time. A lot of people will be in Brazil this summer. So they'll be in the right place at the right time. It doesn't mean they'll win the World Cup. So you can only do that if you have the right people, which is why I will finish. We're in the right place at the right time, but we also have the right people. And that's the whole difference.\r\nSo I am confident that we will continue to deliver a unique combination of growth and cash over the long term. I thank you, and we are ready to take your questions.\r\nSo for the first time, I can say, lady and gentlemen, if you can join us on the podium, we'll start the Q&A session, please.",
      "transcript_text3": "So for your question, please raise your hand, state your name and your firm's name, and then we'll take your questions. So we'll just let everyone settle.\r\nAll right, why don't we start with Andrew.\n\n---\n\nIt's Andrew Crean with Autonomous. Can I ask 3 questions, actually? Firstly, on your cash target of GBP 10 billion over the next 4 years, you're already at run rate. In 2013, you did GBP 2.5 billion. You're projecting that the Asian business will go up by GBP 400 million. So basically, the first question is, is other parts likely to go down? Or is the GBP 10 billion too conservative?  Secondly, thank you for the economic capital coverage. It's gone up considerably. How should we judge when you get into a situation of having excess capital, which may not be able to be reinvested and should be returned? And then thirdly, now that you've bidded the REALIC acquisition down, do you have a further appetite for acquisitions in the States?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you, Andrew. On the target, I'll let Nic answer. I'll come back on the economic capital coverage, and Mike will take REALIC. So Nic, do you want to say that GBP 10 billion was too conservative or not?\n\n---\n\nI don't think the GBP 10 billion is too conservative. The -- 2 things I would say. Of course, that GBP 10 billion is after recycling -- is after the investment that we have to make, and you've seen in the presentation today an analysis indeed, quite a lot of detail on the opportunities that exist. So it is after effectively the drag of 4 years worth of growth across all of our markets. As for the 2013 result, it is flattered to a degree by positive experience variances. I mean, we'll work hard to deliver them, Andrew. The team is committed to doing that, but we don't take that for granted. We don't necessarily plan for those. There's been, in the course of 2013, a number of items that are one-off in nature, and that flattered that particular contribution. If you go back 5 years, we've typically been running experience variances of around GBP 200 million, and that's a more realistic level as we move forward. So in short, don't extrapolate from 2013 because of these effects. And also, please bear in mind that the GBP 10 billion is after deducting considerable investment in new business.\n\n---\n\nA really, really important point, and it's a change in the way the group functions. A few years back, there  used to be a lot of bias embedded in the plan. Certainly, when we started looking at things closely, so people would assume in the plan that interest rates would go this way or that way. So when very big changes has been to say, look, spot is the big predictor of our future, good planning, financial planning discipline is you just take the spot back. You don't build into your plan any headwind or tailwind, period. So that GBP 10 billion is a clean number. It's proper operational performance. No -- so when we get help, the tailwind that we've had this year, well, it's a plus and that's very nice. But there is nothing in these numbers that assumes any type of help from the markets. And these are very thin targets.  Again, as Nic said, it's after funding a lot of growth. The economic coverage, yes. It has gone up for me, and I'll let Nic -- because he's done really all the heavy lifting on this. But I'll just give you maybe a high-level concept while he is preparing his answer. My experience of the group is about -- is actually in a very strong position. And I like it when a measure is consistent with my intuition of the business. How do I think about the group? Where do we profit from? So GBP 8 billion at the end of 2013. You heard us during the crisis say constantly, \"There is no way we can burn through that.\" You can build any financial scenario. You just can't, and that's where in the U.K. you take equity risks. So we're protected in it. The other big risk we carry is the annuity book. We built the credit reserve, which we've discussed many times in the past, it's a complete buffer against credit risks. So we're in a pretty strong position. In Asia, we had a bit of  equity exposure. We sold it in '09. There's basically, so to speak, no financial risk. The sovereign is domestic debt, labor in domestic currency. And another bad joke, but -- as a lot of printing machine works, we won't be able to service domestic debt. This is not foreign debt. So we don't feel that we have the biggest exposure there. We move into the U.S. M&G. Sorry, Michael, but we respect -- not worth mentioning, in terms of capital, capital efficiency, capital-light model, there's no big issues there. So you leverage Jackson. And in Jackson, we believe that we're well hedged. So that was the intuitive view of the group. So I'm not disturbed if we answer -- after we run the economic capital model comes back as well. We're in a strong position. In itself, it doesn't feel odd to me. But do you want to...\n\n---\n\nI guess in response to your question, Andrew, I would probably reiterate 2 points that I made in the presentation. One, it's early days. Before, we can embed this in a very formal way. We need the dust so settle. There is still some way to go, as I said earlier, a lot of work that needs to be done. A lot more guidance that needs to be provided. And ultimately, while this is our judgment, it ultimately needs to accord with the judgment of our lead regulators. So let's wait until the dust settles, until we're working with firmer numbers. And at that point, yes. Then we will come up with a range that we want to operate it within. But the second point I would make, again, reiterate from my presentation, is the fact that it is no more or no less important than any other metric. We run our business -- actually, one of the key aspects of our success is that we haven't run our business in one metric. We used a balanced set of metrics. And what you find when you're making decisions under different scenarios, something different bites every time. So it's like trying to assess -- something has to be -- it's like a Rubik's cube trying to look at different lenses and dimension, whether it's rating capital, whether -- at the moment, we have the IGD framework that is still relevant over the next 2 years, whether it's free surplus. Who knows? Whether it's pure cash -- and it's managing that matrix, and different things will bite depending on the decision. So we are -- and that's what we do day in, day out as we come to each decision. So I don't think this will the determinant, if you like, the bright light, when it comes to informing decision AOB 2016 or beyond when it comes in. We'll continue to run the business by reference to a balanced set of metrics, because we think that is the sensible and the disciplined thing to do.\n\n---\n\nThe best advise we can give to anybody who are new in the insurance company, don't run it on one metric. It's just such a funny complex animal that you can really always do really, really stupid things going after maximization or optimization of one of those and get yourself in a lot of trouble. So it's almost a religious belief in us that we always look at every possible lens: IFRS, EEV, cash, rating agencies, economic capital. I was very wary of people who say, \"Well, we now have the metric by which you need to run the group.\" That's a recipe for trouble. REALIC further appetite? Yes. Short answer is yes. We like the deal very much. We've talked about both enhancing the earnings and diversifying them. We always have a night to rebalance between fee income and -- which is really driven by the VFA group. The spread income from VFAs, historic low really in a cycle, and the kind of technical income from risk business. But it's Mike who's at the forefront [Audio Gap] of that. You want to update a little bit on...\n\n---\n\nThe market has changed a bit on the buy side. I mean, you've seen some very clever private equity, one transaction in particular plays. It had a lot of synergies, and I think the regulators have sort of shut that door for what I would say are sort of non-natural owners in the space. The reasons to sell are very similar to what we've always seen. Sometimes, they're technical, the IT doesn't support the -- a back book at a strong competitor, and they want to get rid of it, that sort of thing. I would say, Andrew, the biggest challenge now in those discussions is when you look at the available spread and the rates we have to use in the assumptions. What that does to the pricing discussion early is challenging because we're going to do these the way we've done all of them. Since we've known each other, I think we've done 2 life companies, 2 broker-dealers and a bank, and I think we have done well for shareholders and all of them. But you -- I think we have to do them when they're available at a price we like, not on a schedule -- for example, we don't put them in our business plans. We just assume they're opportunistic, and that doesn't mean we don't have a lot of resources pursuing them.\n\n---\n\nJon Hocking, Morgan Stanley. I've got 3 questions, please. Firstly, on the U.S., that seemed churlish on the operating leverage. The expenses grew 18%. But on the life slide, I think it was 57%. When you break down the drivers, the life expenses are down 5%. I wonder if you could sort of square that circle, please, and just give us an idea of how quickly you expect the expense base to grow relative to revenues going forward. That's the first question. Second question, SCB in terms of penetration, your 3% sounds quite low. Do you have pockets in that deal where the penetration rate is much higher? So can you give us some idea where the distribution or penetration rates are by branch or by territory? And the third question, the economic capital. Just on a few sort of assumptions questions. You say you're not using diversification for the U.S. position, but are you assuming the surplus over 250% RBC can be used as capital elsewhere in the group? Secondly, on that, I think you -- in November, at the investor day, when you gave the basis, the calculation, you said you're going to use quiz 5 in the U.K. funded. It looks like you did something different. And then finally, you're using 10 basis points for the credit risk adjustment. I think that's still 35% in the rules. Do you want to go through these things?\n\n---\n\nWell, thank you, Jon. Operating leverage in the U.S. so it's between Nic and Mike. But Mike, do you want to go...\n\n---\n\nYou've seen some technical moves, Jon, and some of the guarantees we've pulled down, and I think you'll see there. But as far as the actual acquisition cost, cost to administer a policy, normal operations everything is within pricing, everything continues to come down. We're by far the lowest in the industry. So yes, there isn't a -- having from here or something, but we have a number of initiatives that are driving down costs from here that are continuing to work and we have some things that are sort of a little further out there I think a bit more creative that -- as well. But as far as the year-over-year numbers, you're seeing reduction in expenses per policy on admin. You're seeing reduction acquisition costs all within pricing, none of it materially different than our pricing.\n\n---\n\nI'm not sure -- Sorry, let me just try and answer that. The 5% that you show, you need to go back in the detail in the packs which then breaks that out between acquisition and administration. We just haven't done it because there's a lot of detail on the slide, but the information is in the pack. What you'll then do once you have the 2 components separated out, you will see that acquisition costs are flat to negative. Why is that? Two reasons: one is we're seeing more and more distributors opting for trail commission rather than the upfront commission where you're rewarding them. And that's been an effect that's been coming through for a number of years a lot but is continuing. And the other thing it goes down to what Mike was just saying. When you're taking product actions and when you're making decisions about which products to pull, stop or promote, not promote, we tend to go after the ones that are either highest strain, lowest profitability. And inevitably, high acquisition costs also have higher strain. So that's -- those are the dynamics that you see coming through the acquisition cost line. If you take the maintenance or the recurring cost line, that has grown much more in line with the growth of the business, but there are still some jaws coming through that as you'd expect to see. And I hope that answers your question.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you, Nic. Barry, do you want to -- the way we run the relationship, we have a steering committee on which Barry sits and they meet very regularly and go over the business. Do you want to give some color on the penetration?\n\n---\n\nSure. The reality is it's been a long relationship, 15 years, the first half of that relationship even though it technically exclude -- included other markets, it was in reality mostly a Hong Kong business and so Hong Kong has always been the main driver and is the -- is where we enjoyed the highest level of penetration. Taiwan is very strong as well. Singapore was kind of a late starter. It actually kicked in with much more efficiency and better results when we renewed it last time back in 2008. So Singapore has come on quite strongly as well. Malaysia is doing much better. We've made progress there. And Thailand, even though the bank is small, less than 30 branches, they've -- we've actually made a lot of progress there over the last 5 years. So Taiwan is pretty good as well. But under the new scenario, obviously, the opportunity to do a lot better where we already are, plus tack on some things like India, like China...\n\n---\n\nIndia, China, Philippines, Indonesia...\n\n---\n\nPhilippines. Philippines bank is very small but you've got to start somewhere.\n\n---\n\nYes. And then we had 4 questions on the economic capital. Diversification -- will you take diversification? 250% RBC, do we take credit for elsewhere for what's above that? Would you use QIS5 and 10 basis points, is that enough for credit? Or should we be -- Nic that's yours.\n\n---\n\nSo we haven't brought in diversification for the U.S. business even though we do believe economically it exists because the rules just say you can't do that. If you're going to use deduction and aggregation, in other words, bring in the U.S. using a different basis, then you can't take credit for the diversification, and that's not included. Why 250%? We used it because that is the output. We have a lot of models. We run them off. We run the business off. We include in those one-off models past experience about credit default losses as opposed to -- based on experience, we factor into those models information around realized equity volatility and when we run that off, it comes out of 250%. To give you some sensitivity, ultimately, for every 50 points of RBC, we could have -- it will come down to a discussion ultimately, what -- should you bring it in at 250%? Or should you use 150%? Should you use 300%? But every 50 points cost around 10 points on the cover. So every 50 RBC points is 10 points on the cover. On credit allowance, yes, we are basing it on QIS5. But we've used a variety of parameters to inform that position. QIS5 is one. We've used our own assessment in terms of what we're including for Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 in the existing ICA, and we've modeled, we've created our own model on our view as spreads widen how much of that we should bring in as the liquidity or as opposed to credit. And so we've modeled that and we brought that in. The outcome is included in your packs. So in the base position, we've taken effectively a liquidity premium equivalent to 46% of the spread at the end of 2013. And we've increased that to 51% in a 1 in 200 scenario. So you can get a sense of how much is brought in. In relation to the 10 basis points, what is this just for the benefit of others who may not be close to the debate. This is effectively an allowance for the credit risk on the risk-free rate. The regulators are saying, the risk-free rate is not credit free and you need to make an allowance. 10 basis points is what was used for QIS5. You're absolutely right, there is debate on that. There are different -- we don't believe it's necessarily. We just don't believe it's necessary. I think -- we think it is inappropriate to calibrate actively, using short-term instruments, what this should be when you have a business that will run off for the next 30, 40 years. And we just think philosophically that is flawed in this context, and we will continue to make those -- the case as we move on to level 2 and level 3. But it is another source of uncertainty.\n\n---\n\nYes, you probably saw Sergio Bardino's letter page [ph] yesterday mentioning that, and we're now on the page [ph] and we'll continue to lobby. Not everything is resolved. That's why we caveat this communication. It gives you our view. We're not saying this is going to be the outcome of Solvency II. It's one of the areas where we may give [indiscernible]. Yes?\n\n---\n\nI'm Greig Paterson, KBW. I just want to concentrate on the standard. It's one of deal. I wonder if you could give us a cost. We can obviously work it out end of year when we look at the other intangibles? I just wonder if you can give us a cost? The treatment of the upfront costs on Standard Chartered in terms of IGD and eco-capital, do you raise an intangible then? Can you take credit for it? And just in terms of financing that, I wonder if you could just sort of give us an idea, are you going to raise some debt? Or to what extent can Hong Kong estate finance a portion of the costs?\n\n---\n\nOkay. On the financing, for instance, we -- it's funded with our own resources and there's no really direct contribution from the Hong Kong with-profits fund. It's quite different from the previous deal. But we are in a much different and much stronger position for [indiscernible]. We have GBP 2.2 billion of cash centrally. So we're very comfortable. On the cost, look, to be completely transparent, you know how the situations are. We were all negotiating very late. You saw that the RNS came out after our results, so that should give you an indication of the discussion that have been going on. Of course, in due course, you'll see in our disclosures some of those numbers come true. And you can then make up your mind. But a big point I'll make about that is the one I made during my main presentation that really please consider the upfront payment is a fraction of a financial flows on a deal like this, really a fraction; not even a material fraction. All the value is in the subsequent payments, which frankly you only pay when they sell. These are commissions. So actually, it's quite a bit of derisking in there and big incentive for them to perform, so we get their money with every sale. It's constructed like that. So that's what we have said on the cost. Impact on IGD is going to come through. Nic, do you want to...\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, we will follow the same treatment as we have done for UOB, Thanachart, the distribution fee will not be capitalized in either IGD or in the economic capital markets.\n\n---\n\nJust to follow up, just in terms of the Philippines, we're thinking for a while, I mean that's a big market. You never really talk about it. One of your competitors makes a lot of money out of there. I'm just wondering what your plans are or to sort of try and turbocharge the Philippines?\n\n---\n\nBarry and I are going to fight to jump and answer first. If you remember in December, we actually talked about it. I have a slide on it that showed that profits have been multiplied by 5. We've been growing the agency very, very strongly. I'm saying that because we're both strong believer in the country. It's one of a few countries on the planet that has been upgraded. The sovereign debt of the Philippines has been upgraded, better and better managed, 95 million people. And actually, Barry's too modest to say, that we are #1 in new business in the Philippines, and we don't talk about it enough. So it's not a market we neglect, and we are building there exactly the identical business to Indonesia. We follow the same general agency model. So Barry, can you...\n\n---\n\nWell, I only disagree really with one thing that Tidjane said which is that I'm too modest to say we're #1. Because I'm actually not.\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible] this guy is so modest...\n\n---\n\nQuite happy. They know better than that. Quite happy to shout from the rooftops that we're #1 there. And it's the result of a lot of hard work from Jumbing and the team there. Tidjane's point about the country's balance sheet, family balance sheet is really important. This is increasingly looking like Indonesia some years ago. And geographically, when you think about the logistics of trying to build out a business in the Philippines, it is, again, it's thousands of islands. It's an archipelago just like Indonesia is. So there's complexity in that. And that's why we have lifted many of the ideas that have proven to be so successful in Indonesia, dropped them into the Philippines, localized obviously, as you always have to do. But many of these same principles are now being executed against very well by the team there in the Philippines, and so we've gone from -- we've never had more than about 1,500 agents historically. We're over 8,000 now and moving fast. So a lot of the things that you saw in Indonesia several years ago, you're starting to see in the Philippines. So I would suggest that you should be very optimistic about it.\n\n---\n\nBack to my [indiscernible] and energy, and we also have a great CEO...\n\n---\n\nYes, Jumbing is great...\n\n---\n\nHe's really, really a star. Absolute star. Can I go? Chris?\n\n---\n\nChris Esson from Crédit Suisse. Just 2 quick questions, please. Firstly on Thailand. My impression from Thailand is that unit-linked is a product that doesn't have a huge amount of support, and yet it looks like you're IFRS payback has just -- is very fast and certainly the result from Thailand was surprisingly strong. I just wondered if you could provide an explanation for that? And secondly, a market that we haven't really heard about for some time, India, remains a bit of a sleeping giant and I just wonder if you could provide an update on that? And what potentially could happen that would make it a sweet spot market in the future?\n\n---\n\nOkay, thank you, Chris. Thailand, just a word about Thanachart. They are, I think, #1 in auto credit in Thailand?\n\n---\n\nThat's it.\n\n---\n\nSo when you see Barry nodding, that's what we're selling. We're selling insurance on those [indiscernible], it's very profitable. Good IFRS, good thing...\n\n---\n\nYes, that's exactly. They are, by far, the #1 auto financed business in the market that operates not just in Bangkok, but all throughout the country as well. So it's a very strong part of their franchise. We have very high penetration rates, attaching the product to that. So that's why you're seeing the economics you're seeing.\n\n---\n\nAnd that's a start...\n\n---\n\nYes, absolutely...\n\n---\n\nSo we'll do IFRS [ph]...\n\n---\n\nTidjane alluded to the fast start we got in '02, but I mean -- I think it bears dwelling on a little bit because when we were getting ready to launch this deal, our partners candidly said, well, you changed some products on and so forth. So you need to expect that the sales levels will come down a little bit, but give us 6 months and the team will rally around and then it will start moving back up and we'll get back to where we were and then we'll go forward and it will be a really good deal but you have to be patient, it will take time. And what, in fact, happened was, as Tidjane said, we started selling the first day. We were almost immediately selling in almost 100% of the branches and the trajectory has not kind of dipped and then gone like this. It's actually just gone like this. So even the partner candidly is surprised at how much efficiency we've been able to bring to that deal. It's a very good outcome.\n\n---\n\nIt's another great CEO and a great team...\n\n---\n\nAnother great CEO...\n\n---\n\nHe's done a phenomenal job...\n\n---\n\nA nice, terrific guy...\n\n---\n\nReally remarkable. The Integration, everything. We've been there many times together and it's just a -- it takes more case.\n\n---\n\nNo. It's a great team.\n\n---\n\nIndia. You want to say a few words? India?\n\n---\n\nOh, about?\n\n---\n\nProspects.\n\n---\n\nYes, well, it's a complicated environment. There's not much we can do about the environment. We can only respond to the environment. So we've seen some political volatility,  if you will, effectively that translates into the difficulty in terms of getting some fundamental changes made. We've seen regulatory volatility we call a few years ago. Talk about some significant tax changes that would've been really punitive. So there's always drama but again, we can't control the drama. We can only control how we respond to it. I think we've responded to it brilliantly. The team there, again, we keep talking about the teams but that's our 2 raw materials in this business are capital and people. And we've got plenty of capital and we've got absolutely best-in-class people. So Sandeep Bakshi [ph] who runs that business came out of ICICI is running their retail bank before he came to work with us. He's just been a steady hand, done a great job. What you -- as a result seen from that business is gains in market share in a very volatile environment. So while most of the foreign sector, if you will, has been very disrupted. We've continued to just inch our way up the league tables and gain share, the profit from this business is now very good. May I remind you that we were the first business to generate the profit. We were the first business to pay a dividend as well. We've been taking dividends out of this business over 2 years, about 2.5 years now. And this year we actually got a special dividend now because of the strong financial performance of the business. So these guys are just doing a great job. If the environment improves, does that improve -- then you'd get more investor confidence in the market. I mean there, obviously, be a lot of positive effects of that. I'm not in a position to promise that. What I am in a position to promise is that whatever the environment is, we'll run a best-in-class business.\n\n---\n\nThis is actually really, really important point about how we run the portfolio. You've got kind of the ideal positions, that's the sweet spot, famous sweet spot. For various reasons, we're in a really good position, with just right business and grow Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam. Those are the no-brainers, it just happens. Then you've got the slightly more complicated places. And when it's a difficult environment, what we will not do for our shareholders is allow people to destroy value. So something like India that used to be significantly negative, IFRS negative. We've turned into a positive. Another story that Barry is telling us. So it pays a dividend. The same is true of Korea, a very difficult market, but we have really shrunk the business and got it into a place where it does not really actually destroy the value.\n\n---\n\nIt makes money.\n\n---\n\nIt makes money and then you get kind of long-term options like China. Actually, we haven't talked about it but China is up 41% in 2013. And then back to my compounding argument, 41% on top of 30%, on top of 40% and it's becoming material. It's moving up the ranks every year [indiscernible], but it's actually doing well.\n\n---\n\nYes. If you think about it in the context of market, I mean, if we're honest, none of the foreign companies are competing with the [indiscernible] or the China Life's, but remember the numbers that you see for our business are half the business. So you double those numbers and then look at that against the rest of our businesses in PCA and you realized this has actually getting to be a pretty big business. So this is another one why you should watch the space.\n\n---\n\nStarting to march up. Farooq?\n\n---\n\nIt's Farooq Hanif from Citi. I've got 3 questions on the U.S. business, actually. I want to go back to your kind of guidance on remittance. I know you got this range, but it just seems to me when you look at the U.S. business, the statutory profits are up, the book is derisking and your RBC ratio is upper end. What's stopping you from raising your remittance ratio? That's question one. Question two, related to that is you had a cash flow operating variance, which is positive, which is ALM-related, spread related. Can you just talk about how that GBP 200 million to GBP 300 million how that could develop going forward? And the last point is going back to Jon's question on the jaws. Is the trend in trail commissions net expense positive. So do we see that actually contributing to jaws going forward?\n\n---\n\nWell, we're really happy to get 3 questions on the U.S. and don't mention hedging. Shows you how the world changes. We're really pleased. Look, anyway, do you want to -- and really, yes, that profit going up, derisking RBC ratio good, this is all actually nice problems to have. Mike, do you want to talk about the...\n\n---\n\nSo we showed you in December, our percentage of remittance versus percentage of book, including comparing that to U.S. companies and share buybacks, and I think we're at the high-end of anybody's ratios there. If I put my Prudential Board hat on, the general view is there's not a need to put excess capital in the center beyond the levels we need. There is some friction in moving it there. Okay? So the idea is leave it in the business units for resilience, for M&A and things like that. There is a -- in the last 2 years, we've been above or actually 3 years we've gotten an approval from the regulator for a special dividend, that being an excess of the policy rules. And they're pretty reasonable people when the businesses are doing well, and they're growing the way we are and have the earnings and they look close out our hedges and other dynamics. So it's a discussion we have every year and we wouldn't want to give you any guidance on that number going up or down, but we have -- yes, there's -- the capital is more fungible in a pure regulatory measurement, but then there is also tactical issues at the group level to consider on top of that.\n\n---\n\nJust to be clear you're paying below potential regulatory policy level. You're paying...\n\n---\n\nAbove.\n\n---\n\nAbove. That's why we said 3 years, we got 3 times permission to go above. That's what he just said.\n\n---\n\nAnd again, that's just strength of the business, growth of capital, growth of cash flow. I mean if you look at last year, funding the sales, funding the dividend, closing REALIC and still growing net capital. That's a strong discussion with the regulator on the health of the business.\n\n---\n\nSo thanks for allowing us to make that point because really that's what sensitivity Mike is alluding to. In the post crisis world, we really have quite advanced discussions with regulators around dividend and rightly so -- absolutely, I have no issue with that but because we tend to be above that threshold, we're not going to start giving you numbers or targets, I think, implicitly force the hand of the regulator. We have to be very mindful of the relationship there. And -- so think about what we tell you as something that takes into account that contract because we've been lately above that.\n\n---\n\nCan I just make one point, just to reiterate something that I said in December, that when it comes to Jackson, using the pure operational free surplus isn't the right reference point. You need to factor the below the line there. And I illustrated back in December that, that is a very good proxy of mimicking what's happening in the underlying total adjusted capital development on the local RBC. And generally, we've paid around the mid-60s, which is not a bad ratio for a business that is growing so phenomenally, has spent the last few years trying to repair the balance sheet to a degree from the earlier crisis and, of course, absorb the acquisition of REALIC. So all that is working well.\n\n---\n\nAnd the below the line is the hedging question which I didn't asked, basically.\n\n---\n\nCorrect. I mean, that is -- that has a -- it is certainly on the stat basis, the hedges will also come through but the reserves, given the cleanliness, if you like, although the clean position of the -- of the book, the reserves are flawed. So you're getting a mismatch coming through that particular ratio, which will sort itself out because the higher fee base will give me you more operating performance going forward.\n\n---\n\nIn page 102 in the supplements has the normal realignment to economic capital. We want to make sure we're consistent with the presentation. You asked a question on the impact of that allocation of trail commissions versus the front end commissions. It's coming from a couple of different things. It's coming from distributors. Different firms have different structures and so as the business is a little less independent channel. So you get a more firms that prefer and push towards, not necessarily levelized commission, but at least they'll be in some of the C share products. There is -- so that's just mix of who were selling through. That's in our pricing, so I wouldn't look for that to be an event, either way. The other element you get with that is point in the cycle. And so you tend to have age of advisors and how well the markets doing and how well they're doing they tend -- if the business is going well for retail advisor, they can to be thinking about deferring revenue and growing the value of their book. If it's a difficult time, you tend to see more A share in smaller practice, okay? So those are both factors, but again it's in our pricing. You had a third question, I'm sorry, I missed it.\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nYou're right. So we have some additional experience contribution to free surplus this year compared to last. In part, that's coming through our spread profits. The same effect that you've seen on IFRS and on EEV is coming through that one. The second one is to do with one-off type tax credits that we've received over and above what we were counting and expecting at this point in the cycle. So that's what's driving, if you like, the slight blip. And this is why, when I was answering Andrew's question earlier, I said there are some elements in there that are one-off in nature in that result across our businesses, not just the U.S. Okay? We'll take 2 more because we're well into the lunch hour now and you know where to find us anyway.\n\n---\n\nBefore we go, Andy and then Gordon.\n\n---\n\nI have 3 questions, if I could. The first one is in the U.S. spread profits. And I think you're still making well over 220 basis points profit on the spread book and certainly that's going to come down to 200 in the short term. Where is the credit rate right now? Where is the reinvestment rate on the U.S. spread book? Just to tell me how far that's going to come down because it doesn't stabilize the 200 basis points. And second question was about the kind of tangible -- movement in tangible NAV of the group and obviously GBP 1.3 billion of net profit but if you look at the Page 57 at the back and goodwill segment, that kind of increased by GBP 1 billion. And so should we ignore kind of tangible metrics on the balance sheet? And the third question was about the kind of SCB transaction and obviously, could you give us some sort of cash flow payback period on that, even if you aren't prepared to disclose it or IRR that will be very helpful.\n\n---\n\nOkay, thank you. Another 3 good questions. We have that, I mean, the numbers on the crediting and the...\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean crediting rates are running around the 320 basis points level. We are -- I don't have the figure in terms of the reinvestment yield that we get on the maturing bonds. It will be [indiscernible]. 4.25, 4.5.\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nSo that's part of the pressure that we see bringing the number down.\n\n---\n\nSo it should drop to 1% over time, that spread margin?\n\n---\n\nWell, it depends on mix. Remember, if you make the assumption that we've got our estimates of how long people will keep their money with us wrong, then it should do that. But remember people are saving for a purpose. They're saving because they're in their 60s and there comes a point where they want to de-accumulate. So I don't think the scenario would arise. That's the first point. The second point is that all the new monies coming in is coming in at either 1.5% on the fixed annuity or at 1% if you go fixed annuity option on VAs. So all of these things are working in a way that will -- we've done detailed complex calculation for you and we've translated into a very simple guidance of 200 basis points.\n\n---\n\nMike, do you want to comment?\n\n---\n\nNic, the key point -- the products being sold, Andy, at this point of cycle, have a 1% floor, okay? So you're at a very different guarantee than you saw pre-crisis. You still have 23 to 25 basis points between our current crediting rates and the floor is on the entire book, so there's still plenty of room to move. And as we've told you we're high in quality, low in duration of the portfolio. Our ability to reinvest or just hold the duration on those positions, I think, is about as good as anybody in the industry. And in the scenario where the compressing -- if spreads never widen, our new sales would affect the equation you're throwing out there as well because you have different math on those.\n\n---\n\nAll right, and there was then tangible net asset value, that goodwill, Nic, do you want to...\n\n---\n\nI think we've rehearsed this many, many time. The reality is there aspects of value which generates profits, IFRS profits that are not captured by shareholders equity. We gave the example earlier of the with-profit transfers. That's not -- Accounting convention today prevents us from recognizing that aspect in our results. A lot of what we write in Asia is health and protection. That's like writing GI business. We don't need a lot of tangible net assets to deliver a high return on a GI business. So I think -- so those are some of the dynamics that are coming through which is why you end up with an IFRS basis, equity basis, which is not representative of the income generation power of this organization.\n\n---\n\nOn SCB, this is actually an interesting point because there used to be a strategy discussion in the group. The old view in Asia book was that bancassurance was less profitable than agency, so margins were lower. And that actually it wasn't a very desirable business. Well, in the way, we look at finance, good business is business that is written above its cost of capital. We don't run the group on margin. Actually, a lot of companies with high margins cannot grow because they fall into that trap of saying, well, if I do this, is going to dilute my margin and this is something that I fight with a passion because it's just wrong thinking. We are in the business of creating the maximum amount of value for our shareholders. And sometimes that involves going into a business with optically lower margins but you've seen that we've actually de-emphasized margins in all our communications to kind of root out that mentality. If we write the business above the cost of capital, we should absolutely do it. That creates value for our shareholder. So that's really how we approach it. So what I can tell you about the contract, that's been all negotiations. We are very confident that the return on capital will be comfortably -- and we've given the Board this comfort and it's been seen by everybody and the advisor. We'll be comfortably above the cost of capital. So it's going to be significantly value-enhancing for our shareholders. But frankly, there is no mileage -- again, think about shareholder value, not management comfort, in opening the hood of that, given what's going on in that region and the commercial dynamics, absolutely no upside. So it's not as, you know, I hope that we have been very transparent as a management team. Just have to look at thickness of the pack over the years, even more and more we opened -- we want you to understand how the group works and how we make money but from time to time, some of that disclosure can just be completely counterproductive. So in the current environment, you will be able to track our progress. You will see some of it flowing from the IGD as in all the disclosures that are coming later in the year, but we just -- we think we really have a -- how can I say this, a competitive advantage where, in our understanding of those transactions and structuring the payments. And as much as we'd like to answer your questions, we don't want to make that available to the competition. I spent enough time myself reading all their presentation of all the peers, so that they do the same thing. You can easily slip a lot of very valuable commercial information doing that. So that's what limit to the transparency. We're not being difficult because we don't want to discuss things that are going to be played back against us later. One last question?  You go three. You go by sets of three. So another three questions, for arithmetic. Okay, Gordon go ahead.\n\n---\n\nJust two, Tidjane. Gordon Aitken from RBC. So first question is on the holding company cash. It's gone up to GBP 2.2 billion, it's a big jump from GBP 1.4 billion and as you raise the GBP 700 million of hybrid debt in December. And you've shown today that you don't need the cash to grow the balance sheet is strong. I'm just wondering what that cash will be used for? And second question on the U.K. I mean this week you've announced the GBP 100 million buy-in with the Church of England scheme. I mean the bulk market there's a very good demand. There's really lack of supply and you presumably expect margins to remain very positive in that market. Just what sort of appetite do you have in the bulk market going forward?\n\n---\n\nAll right, thank you, Gordon for only 2 questions. Do you want to say a word about the cash balance at the center?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, we touched on that in December. I mean candidly, the one good thing about the low-interest rate environment is that you can raise a very high-quality debt. We've been able to raise very long debt at very attractive prices so we took that opportunity, that opportunity is not going to be available forever. We've locked that in and that gives us, I guess, also all sorts of flexibility as we move forward to either pay some of the debt that we carry or to deploy in other areas.\n\n---\n\nYes, and just transactions like SCB, which I know you have a lot of interest in the cash payment but we want to have that flexibility and believe me, it's comfortable to be able to go into most types of conversations with no real cash, no real cash  constraint. That's very comfortable. Jackie, do you want to talk about the bulks and the recent buying?\n\n---\n\nSo Gordon you're absolutely right. I think a recent deal has been publicly announced by a counterparty. In terms of the market itself, I would see it very similarly to how you set it out. I think there's a great deal of demand or opportunity. I think supply has become relatively constrained until we do see some interesting deals coming to the market back end of last year and certainly in the first quarter of this year. I talked into December about the opportunity we had to put this bit more fully. We've got some key competencies, we've got a great brand that's really important to our counterparties and they deal with the business that has a good reputation. We tend to deal at the top end, so above GBP 100 million. That sort of range in large part. These are more complex deals and we have the capabilities to perhaps participate in deals that some others may not. So we see it as an attractive opportunity. We are very disciplined about how we actually use our capacity, obviously, these do bring with them longevity risks and other types of risks that we do want to make sure we get a proper return against. So you should expect to see us participating more aggressively, but within the constraints of very strict capital return hurdles. We certainly won't let go of that particular discipline.\n\n---\n\nWell, Jackie has a very balanced portfolio because she is also in charge of Africa. She's got 2 very different jobs. So thank you, thank you very much for your patience. In this team, many of us have seen GBP 2. I remember seeing GBP 1.95. So to close above GBP 14 is a good day but please keep in mind as we hope we showed you with plenty of potential and upside here. So I leave you with that thought and thank you very much. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text4": "【回答: James Matthews (Executives)】\nSo for your question, please raise your hand, state your name and your firm's name, and then we'll take your questions. So we'll just let everyone settle.\r\nAll right, why don't we start with Andrew.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Crean (Analysts)】\nIt's Andrew Crean with Autonomous. Can I ask 3 questions, actually? Firstly, on your cash target of GBP 10 billion over the next 4 years, you're already at run rate. In 2013, you did GBP 2.5 billion. You're projecting that the Asian business will go up by GBP 400 million. So basically, the first question is, is other parts likely to go down? Or is the GBP 10 billion too conservative?  Secondly, thank you for the economic capital coverage. It's gone up considerably. How should we judge when you get into a situation of having excess capital, which may not be able to be reinvested and should be returned? And then thirdly, now that you've bidded the REALIC acquisition down, do you have a further appetite for acquisitions in the States?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you, Andrew. On the target, I'll let Nic answer. I'll come back on the economic capital coverage, and Mike will take REALIC. So Nic, do you want to say that GBP 10 billion was too conservative or not?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicolaos Nicandrou (Executives)】\nI don't think the GBP 10 billion is too conservative. The -- 2 things I would say. Of course, that GBP 10 billion is after recycling -- is after the investment that we have to make, and you've seen in the presentation today an analysis indeed, quite a lot of detail on the opportunities that exist. So it is after effectively the drag of 4 years worth of growth across all of our markets. As for the 2013 result, it is flattered to a degree by positive experience variances. I mean, we'll work hard to deliver them, Andrew. The team is committed to doing that, but we don't take that for granted. We don't necessarily plan for those. There's been, in the course of 2013, a number of items that are one-off in nature, and that flattered that particular contribution. If you go back 5 years, we've typically been running experience variances of around GBP 200 million, and that's a more realistic level as we move forward. So in short, don't extrapolate from 2013 because of these effects. And also, please bear in mind that the GBP 10 billion is after deducting considerable investment in new business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nA really, really important point, and it's a change in the way the group functions. A few years back, there  used to be a lot of bias embedded in the plan. Certainly, when we started looking at things closely, so people would assume in the plan that interest rates would go this way or that way. So when very big changes has been to say, look, spot is the big predictor of our future, good planning, financial planning discipline is you just take the spot back. You don't build into your plan any headwind or tailwind, period. So that GBP 10 billion is a clean number. It's proper operational performance. No -- so when we get help, the tailwind that we've had this year, well, it's a plus and that's very nice. But there is nothing in these numbers that assumes any type of help from the markets. And these are very thin targets.  Again, as Nic said, it's after funding a lot of growth. The economic coverage, yes. It has gone up for me, and I'll let Nic -- because he's done really all the heavy lifting on this. But I'll just give you maybe a high-level concept while he is preparing his answer. My experience of the group is about -- is actually in a very strong position. And I like it when a measure is consistent with my intuition of the business. How do I think about the group? Where do we profit from? So GBP 8 billion at the end of 2013. You heard us during the crisis say constantly, \"There is no way we can burn through that.\" You can build any financial scenario. You just can't, and that's where in the U.K. you take equity risks. So we're protected in it. The other big risk we carry is the annuity book. We built the credit reserve, which we've discussed many times in the past, it's a complete buffer against credit risks. So we're in a pretty strong position. In Asia, we had a bit of  equity exposure. We sold it in '09. There's basically, so to speak, no financial risk. The sovereign is domestic debt, labor in domestic currency. And another bad joke, but -- as a lot of printing machine works, we won't be able to service domestic debt. This is not foreign debt. So we don't feel that we have the biggest exposure there. We move into the U.S. M&G. Sorry, Michael, but we respect -- not worth mentioning, in terms of capital, capital efficiency, capital-light model, there's no big issues there. So you leverage Jackson. And in Jackson, we believe that we're well hedged. So that was the intuitive view of the group. So I'm not disturbed if we answer -- after we run the economic capital model comes back as well. We're in a strong position. In itself, it doesn't feel odd to me. But do you want to...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicolaos Nicandrou (Executives)】\nI guess in response to your question, Andrew, I would probably reiterate 2 points that I made in the presentation. One, it's early days. Before, we can embed this in a very formal way. We need the dust so settle. There is still some way to go, as I said earlier, a lot of work that needs to be done. A lot more guidance that needs to be provided. And ultimately, while this is our judgment, it ultimately needs to accord with the judgment of our lead regulators. So let's wait until the dust settles, until we're working with firmer numbers. And at that point, yes. Then we will come up with a range that we want to operate it within. But the second point I would make, again, reiterate from my presentation, is the fact that it is no more or no less important than any other metric. We run our business -- actually, one of the key aspects of our success is that we haven't run our business in one metric. We used a balanced set of metrics. And what you find when you're making decisions under different scenarios, something different bites every time. So it's like trying to assess -- something has to be -- it's like a Rubik's cube trying to look at different lenses and dimension, whether it's rating capital, whether -- at the moment, we have the IGD framework that is still relevant over the next 2 years, whether it's free surplus. Who knows? Whether it's pure cash -- and it's managing that matrix, and different things will bite depending on the decision. So we are -- and that's what we do day in, day out as we come to each decision. So I don't think this will the determinant, if you like, the bright light, when it comes to informing decision AOB 2016 or beyond when it comes in. We'll continue to run the business by reference to a balanced set of metrics, because we think that is the sensible and the disciplined thing to do.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nThe best advise we can give to anybody who are new in the insurance company, don't run it on one metric. It's just such a funny complex animal that you can really always do really, really stupid things going after maximization or optimization of one of those and get yourself in a lot of trouble. So it's almost a religious belief in us that we always look at every possible lens: IFRS, EEV, cash, rating agencies, economic capital. I was very wary of people who say, \"Well, we now have the metric by which you need to run the group.\" That's a recipe for trouble. REALIC further appetite? Yes. Short answer is yes. We like the deal very much. We've talked about both enhancing the earnings and diversifying them. We always have a night to rebalance between fee income and -- which is really driven by the VFA group. The spread income from VFAs, historic low really in a cycle, and the kind of technical income from risk business. But it's Mike who's at the forefront [Audio Gap] of that. You want to update a little bit on...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael McLintock (Executives)】\nThe market has changed a bit on the buy side. I mean, you've seen some very clever private equity, one transaction in particular plays. It had a lot of synergies, and I think the regulators have sort of shut that door for what I would say are sort of non-natural owners in the space. The reasons to sell are very similar to what we've always seen. Sometimes, they're technical, the IT doesn't support the -- a back book at a strong competitor, and they want to get rid of it, that sort of thing. I would say, Andrew, the biggest challenge now in those discussions is when you look at the available spread and the rates we have to use in the assumptions. What that does to the pricing discussion early is challenging because we're going to do these the way we've done all of them. Since we've known each other, I think we've done 2 life companies, 2 broker-dealers and a bank, and I think we have done well for shareholders and all of them. But you -- I think we have to do them when they're available at a price we like, not on a schedule -- for example, we don't put them in our business plans. We just assume they're opportunistic, and that doesn't mean we don't have a lot of resources pursuing them.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jon Hocking (Analysts)】\nJon Hocking, Morgan Stanley. I've got 3 questions, please. Firstly, on the U.S., that seemed churlish on the operating leverage. The expenses grew 18%. But on the life slide, I think it was 57%. When you break down the drivers, the life expenses are down 5%. I wonder if you could sort of square that circle, please, and just give us an idea of how quickly you expect the expense base to grow relative to revenues going forward. That's the first question. Second question, SCB in terms of penetration, your 3% sounds quite low. Do you have pockets in that deal where the penetration rate is much higher? So can you give us some idea where the distribution or penetration rates are by branch or by territory? And the third question, the economic capital. Just on a few sort of assumptions questions. You say you're not using diversification for the U.S. position, but are you assuming the surplus over 250% RBC can be used as capital elsewhere in the group? Secondly, on that, I think you -- in November, at the investor day, when you gave the basis, the calculation, you said you're going to use quiz 5 in the U.K. funded. It looks like you did something different. And then finally, you're using 10 basis points for the credit risk adjustment. I think that's still 35% in the rules. Do you want to go through these things?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nWell, thank you, Jon. Operating leverage in the U.S. so it's between Nic and Mike. But Mike, do you want to go...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael McLintock (Executives)】\nYou've seen some technical moves, Jon, and some of the guarantees we've pulled down, and I think you'll see there. But as far as the actual acquisition cost, cost to administer a policy, normal operations everything is within pricing, everything continues to come down. We're by far the lowest in the industry. So yes, there isn't a -- having from here or something, but we have a number of initiatives that are driving down costs from here that are continuing to work and we have some things that are sort of a little further out there I think a bit more creative that -- as well. But as far as the year-over-year numbers, you're seeing reduction in expenses per policy on admin. You're seeing reduction acquisition costs all within pricing, none of it materially different than our pricing.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicolaos Nicandrou (Executives)】\nI'm not sure -- Sorry, let me just try and answer that. The 5% that you show, you need to go back in the detail in the packs which then breaks that out between acquisition and administration. We just haven't done it because there's a lot of detail on the slide, but the information is in the pack. What you'll then do once you have the 2 components separated out, you will see that acquisition costs are flat to negative. Why is that? Two reasons: one is we're seeing more and more distributors opting for trail commission rather than the upfront commission where you're rewarding them. And that's been an effect that's been coming through for a number of years a lot but is continuing. And the other thing it goes down to what Mike was just saying. When you're taking product actions and when you're making decisions about which products to pull, stop or promote, not promote, we tend to go after the ones that are either highest strain, lowest profitability. And inevitably, high acquisition costs also have higher strain. So that's -- those are the dynamics that you see coming through the acquisition cost line. If you take the maintenance or the recurring cost line, that has grown much more in line with the growth of the business, but there are still some jaws coming through that as you'd expect to see. And I hope that answers your question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you, Nic. Barry, do you want to -- the way we run the relationship, we have a steering committee on which Barry sits and they meet very regularly and go over the business. Do you want to give some color on the penetration?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Barry Stowe (Executives)】\nSure. The reality is it's been a long relationship, 15 years, the first half of that relationship even though it technically exclude -- included other markets, it was in reality mostly a Hong Kong business and so Hong Kong has always been the main driver and is the -- is where we enjoyed the highest level of penetration. Taiwan is very strong as well. Singapore was kind of a late starter. It actually kicked in with much more efficiency and better results when we renewed it last time back in 2008. So Singapore has come on quite strongly as well. Malaysia is doing much better. We've made progress there. And Thailand, even though the bank is small, less than 30 branches, they've -- we've actually made a lot of progress there over the last 5 years. So Taiwan is pretty good as well. But under the new scenario, obviously, the opportunity to do a lot better where we already are, plus tack on some things like India, like China...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nIndia, China, Philippines, Indonesia...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Barry Stowe (Executives)】\nPhilippines. Philippines bank is very small but you've got to start somewhere.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nYes. And then we had 4 questions on the economic capital. Diversification -- will you take diversification? 250% RBC, do we take credit for elsewhere for what's above that? Would you use QIS5 and 10 basis points, is that enough for credit? Or should we be -- Nic that's yours.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicolaos Nicandrou (Executives)】\nSo we haven't brought in diversification for the U.S. business even though we do believe economically it exists because the rules just say you can't do that. If you're going to use deduction and aggregation, in other words, bring in the U.S. using a different basis, then you can't take credit for the diversification, and that's not included. Why 250%? We used it because that is the output. We have a lot of models. We run them off. We run the business off. We include in those one-off models past experience about credit default losses as opposed to -- based on experience, we factor into those models information around realized equity volatility and when we run that off, it comes out of 250%. To give you some sensitivity, ultimately, for every 50 points of RBC, we could have -- it will come down to a discussion ultimately, what -- should you bring it in at 250%? Or should you use 150%? Should you use 300%? But every 50 points cost around 10 points on the cover. So every 50 RBC points is 10 points on the cover. On credit allowance, yes, we are basing it on QIS5. But we've used a variety of parameters to inform that position. QIS5 is one. We've used our own assessment in terms of what we're including for Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 in the existing ICA, and we've modeled, we've created our own model on our view as spreads widen how much of that we should bring in as the liquidity or as opposed to credit. And so we've modeled that and we brought that in. The outcome is included in your packs. So in the base position, we've taken effectively a liquidity premium equivalent to 46% of the spread at the end of 2013. And we've increased that to 51% in a 1 in 200 scenario. So you can get a sense of how much is brought in. In relation to the 10 basis points, what is this just for the benefit of others who may not be close to the debate. This is effectively an allowance for the credit risk on the risk-free rate. The regulators are saying, the risk-free rate is not credit free and you need to make an allowance. 10 basis points is what was used for QIS5. You're absolutely right, there is debate on that. There are different -- we don't believe it's necessarily. We just don't believe it's necessary. I think -- we think it is inappropriate to calibrate actively, using short-term instruments, what this should be when you have a business that will run off for the next 30, 40 years. And we just think philosophically that is flawed in this context, and we will continue to make those -- the case as we move on to level 2 and level 3. But it is another source of uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nYes, you probably saw Sergio Bardino's letter page [ph] yesterday mentioning that, and we're now on the page [ph] and we'll continue to lobby. Not everything is resolved. That's why we caveat this communication. It gives you our view. We're not saying this is going to be the outcome of Solvency II. It's one of the areas where we may give [indiscernible]. Yes?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Greig Paterson (Analysts)】\nI'm Greig Paterson, KBW. I just want to concentrate on the standard. It's one of deal. I wonder if you could give us a cost. We can obviously work it out end of year when we look at the other intangibles? I just wonder if you can give us a cost? The treatment of the upfront costs on Standard Chartered in terms of IGD and eco-capital, do you raise an intangible then? Can you take credit for it? And just in terms of financing that, I wonder if you could just sort of give us an idea, are you going to raise some debt? Or to what extent can Hong Kong estate finance a portion of the costs?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nOkay. On the financing, for instance, we -- it's funded with our own resources and there's no really direct contribution from the Hong Kong with-profits fund. It's quite different from the previous deal. But we are in a much different and much stronger position for [indiscernible]. We have GBP 2.2 billion of cash centrally. So we're very comfortable. On the cost, look, to be completely transparent, you know how the situations are. We were all negotiating very late. You saw that the RNS came out after our results, so that should give you an indication of the discussion that have been going on. Of course, in due course, you'll see in our disclosures some of those numbers come true. And you can then make up your mind. But a big point I'll make about that is the one I made during my main presentation that really please consider the upfront payment is a fraction of a financial flows on a deal like this, really a fraction; not even a material fraction. All the value is in the subsequent payments, which frankly you only pay when they sell. These are commissions. So actually, it's quite a bit of derisking in there and big incentive for them to perform, so we get their money with every sale. It's constructed like that. So that's what we have said on the cost. Impact on IGD is going to come through. Nic, do you want to...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicolaos Nicandrou (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, we will follow the same treatment as we have done for UOB, Thanachart, the distribution fee will not be capitalized in either IGD or in the economic capital markets.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Greig Paterson (Analysts)】\nJust to follow up, just in terms of the Philippines, we're thinking for a while, I mean that's a big market. You never really talk about it. One of your competitors makes a lot of money out of there. I'm just wondering what your plans are or to sort of try and turbocharge the Philippines?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nBarry and I are going to fight to jump and answer first. If you remember in December, we actually talked about it. I have a slide on it that showed that profits have been multiplied by 5. We've been growing the agency very, very strongly. I'm saying that because we're both strong believer in the country. It's one of a few countries on the planet that has been upgraded. The sovereign debt of the Philippines has been upgraded, better and better managed, 95 million people. And actually, Barry's too modest to say, that we are #1 in new business in the Philippines, and we don't talk about it enough. So it's not a market we neglect, and we are building there exactly the identical business to Indonesia. We follow the same general agency model. So Barry, can you...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Barry Stowe (Executives)】\nWell, I only disagree really with one thing that Tidjane said which is that I'm too modest to say we're #1. Because I'm actually not.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\n[indiscernible] this guy is so modest...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Barry Stowe (Executives)】\nQuite happy. They know better than that. Quite happy to shout from the rooftops that we're #1 there. And it's the result of a lot of hard work from Jumbing and the team there. Tidjane's point about the country's balance sheet, family balance sheet is really important. This is increasingly looking like Indonesia some years ago. And geographically, when you think about the logistics of trying to build out a business in the Philippines, it is, again, it's thousands of islands. It's an archipelago just like Indonesia is. So there's complexity in that. And that's why we have lifted many of the ideas that have proven to be so successful in Indonesia, dropped them into the Philippines, localized obviously, as you always have to do. But many of these same principles are now being executed against very well by the team there in the Philippines, and so we've gone from -- we've never had more than about 1,500 agents historically. We're over 8,000 now and moving fast. So a lot of the things that you saw in Indonesia several years ago, you're starting to see in the Philippines. So I would suggest that you should be very optimistic about it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nBack to my [indiscernible] and energy, and we also have a great CEO...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Barry Stowe (Executives)】\nYes, Jumbing is great...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nHe's really, really a star. Absolute star. Can I go? Chris?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Esson (Analysts)】\nChris Esson from Crédit Suisse. Just 2 quick questions, please. Firstly on Thailand. My impression from Thailand is that unit-linked is a product that doesn't have a huge amount of support, and yet it looks like you're IFRS payback has just -- is very fast and certainly the result from Thailand was surprisingly strong. I just wondered if you could provide an explanation for that? And secondly, a market that we haven't really heard about for some time, India, remains a bit of a sleeping giant and I just wonder if you could provide an update on that? And what potentially could happen that would make it a sweet spot market in the future?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nOkay, thank you, Chris. Thailand, just a word about Thanachart. They are, I think, #1 in auto credit in Thailand?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Barry Stowe (Executives)】\nThat's it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nSo when you see Barry nodding, that's what we're selling. We're selling insurance on those [indiscernible], it's very profitable. Good IFRS, good thing...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Barry Stowe (Executives)】\nYes, that's exactly. They are, by far, the #1 auto financed business in the market that operates not just in Bangkok, but all throughout the country as well. So it's a very strong part of their franchise. We have very high penetration rates, attaching the product to that. So that's why you're seeing the economics you're seeing.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nAnd that's a start...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Barry Stowe (Executives)】\nYes, absolutely...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nSo we'll do IFRS [ph]...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Barry Stowe (Executives)】\nTidjane alluded to the fast start we got in '02, but I mean -- I think it bears dwelling on a little bit because when we were getting ready to launch this deal, our partners candidly said, well, you changed some products on and so forth. So you need to expect that the sales levels will come down a little bit, but give us 6 months and the team will rally around and then it will start moving back up and we'll get back to where we were and then we'll go forward and it will be a really good deal but you have to be patient, it will take time. And what, in fact, happened was, as Tidjane said, we started selling the first day. We were almost immediately selling in almost 100% of the branches and the trajectory has not kind of dipped and then gone like this. It's actually just gone like this. So even the partner candidly is surprised at how much efficiency we've been able to bring to that deal. It's a very good outcome.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nIt's another great CEO and a great team...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Barry Stowe (Executives)】\nAnother great CEO...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nHe's done a phenomenal job...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Barry Stowe (Executives)】\nA nice, terrific guy...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nReally remarkable. The Integration, everything. We've been there many times together and it's just a -- it takes more case.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Barry Stowe (Executives)】\nNo. It's a great team.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nIndia. You want to say a few words? India?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael McLintock (Executives)】\nOh, about?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nProspects.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael McLintock (Executives)】\nYes, well, it's a complicated environment. There's not much we can do about the environment. We can only respond to the environment. So we've seen some political volatility,  if you will, effectively that translates into the difficulty in terms of getting some fundamental changes made. We've seen regulatory volatility we call a few years ago. Talk about some significant tax changes that would've been really punitive. So there's always drama but again, we can't control the drama. We can only control how we respond to it. I think we've responded to it brilliantly. The team there, again, we keep talking about the teams but that's our 2 raw materials in this business are capital and people. And we've got plenty of capital and we've got absolutely best-in-class people. So Sandeep Bakshi [ph] who runs that business came out of ICICI is running their retail bank before he came to work with us. He's just been a steady hand, done a great job. What you -- as a result seen from that business is gains in market share in a very volatile environment. So while most of the foreign sector, if you will, has been very disrupted. We've continued to just inch our way up the league tables and gain share, the profit from this business is now very good. May I remind you that we were the first business to generate the profit. We were the first business to pay a dividend as well. We've been taking dividends out of this business over 2 years, about 2.5 years now. And this year we actually got a special dividend now because of the strong financial performance of the business. So these guys are just doing a great job. If the environment improves, does that improve -- then you'd get more investor confidence in the market. I mean there, obviously, be a lot of positive effects of that. I'm not in a position to promise that. What I am in a position to promise is that whatever the environment is, we'll run a best-in-class business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nThis is actually really, really important point about how we run the portfolio. You've got kind of the ideal positions, that's the sweet spot, famous sweet spot. For various reasons, we're in a really good position, with just right business and grow Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam. Those are the no-brainers, it just happens. Then you've got the slightly more complicated places. And when it's a difficult environment, what we will not do for our shareholders is allow people to destroy value. So something like India that used to be significantly negative, IFRS negative. We've turned into a positive. Another story that Barry is telling us. So it pays a dividend. The same is true of Korea, a very difficult market, but we have really shrunk the business and got it into a place where it does not really actually destroy the value.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael McLintock (Executives)】\nIt makes money.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nIt makes money and then you get kind of long-term options like China. Actually, we haven't talked about it but China is up 41% in 2013. And then back to my compounding argument, 41% on top of 30%, on top of 40% and it's becoming material. It's moving up the ranks every year [indiscernible], but it's actually doing well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael McLintock (Executives)】\nYes. If you think about it in the context of market, I mean, if we're honest, none of the foreign companies are competing with the [indiscernible] or the China Life's, but remember the numbers that you see for our business are half the business. So you double those numbers and then look at that against the rest of our businesses in PCA and you realized this has actually getting to be a pretty big business. So this is another one why you should watch the space.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nStarting to march up. Farooq?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Farooq Hanif (Analysts)】\nIt's Farooq Hanif from Citi. I've got 3 questions on the U.S. business, actually. I want to go back to your kind of guidance on remittance. I know you got this range, but it just seems to me when you look at the U.S. business, the statutory profits are up, the book is derisking and your RBC ratio is upper end. What's stopping you from raising your remittance ratio? That's question one. Question two, related to that is you had a cash flow operating variance, which is positive, which is ALM-related, spread related. Can you just talk about how that GBP 200 million to GBP 300 million how that could develop going forward? And the last point is going back to Jon's question on the jaws. Is the trend in trail commissions net expense positive. So do we see that actually contributing to jaws going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nWell, we're really happy to get 3 questions on the U.S. and don't mention hedging. Shows you how the world changes. We're really pleased. Look, anyway, do you want to -- and really, yes, that profit going up, derisking RBC ratio good, this is all actually nice problems to have. Mike, do you want to talk about the...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael McLintock (Executives)】\nSo we showed you in December, our percentage of remittance versus percentage of book, including comparing that to U.S. companies and share buybacks, and I think we're at the high-end of anybody's ratios there. If I put my Prudential Board hat on, the general view is there's not a need to put excess capital in the center beyond the levels we need. There is some friction in moving it there. Okay? So the idea is leave it in the business units for resilience, for M&A and things like that. There is a -- in the last 2 years, we've been above or actually 3 years we've gotten an approval from the regulator for a special dividend, that being an excess of the policy rules. And they're pretty reasonable people when the businesses are doing well, and they're growing the way we are and have the earnings and they look close out our hedges and other dynamics. So it's a discussion we have every year and we wouldn't want to give you any guidance on that number going up or down, but we have -- yes, there's -- the capital is more fungible in a pure regulatory measurement, but then there is also tactical issues at the group level to consider on top of that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Farooq Hanif (Analysts)】\nJust to be clear you're paying below potential regulatory policy level. You're paying...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael McLintock (Executives)】\nAbove.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nAbove. That's why we said 3 years, we got 3 times permission to go above. That's what he just said.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael McLintock (Executives)】\nAnd again, that's just strength of the business, growth of capital, growth of cash flow. I mean if you look at last year, funding the sales, funding the dividend, closing REALIC and still growing net capital. That's a strong discussion with the regulator on the health of the business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nSo thanks for allowing us to make that point because really that's what sensitivity Mike is alluding to. In the post crisis world, we really have quite advanced discussions with regulators around dividend and rightly so -- absolutely, I have no issue with that but because we tend to be above that threshold, we're not going to start giving you numbers or targets, I think, implicitly force the hand of the regulator. We have to be very mindful of the relationship there. And -- so think about what we tell you as something that takes into account that contract because we've been lately above that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicolaos Nicandrou (Executives)】\nCan I just make one point, just to reiterate something that I said in December, that when it comes to Jackson, using the pure operational free surplus isn't the right reference point. You need to factor the below the line there. And I illustrated back in December that, that is a very good proxy of mimicking what's happening in the underlying total adjusted capital development on the local RBC. And generally, we've paid around the mid-60s, which is not a bad ratio for a business that is growing so phenomenally, has spent the last few years trying to repair the balance sheet to a degree from the earlier crisis and, of course, absorb the acquisition of REALIC. So all that is working well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Farooq Hanif (Analysts)】\nAnd the below the line is the hedging question which I didn't asked, basically.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicolaos Nicandrou (Executives)】\nCorrect. I mean, that is -- that has a -- it is certainly on the stat basis, the hedges will also come through but the reserves, given the cleanliness, if you like, although the clean position of the -- of the book, the reserves are flawed. So you're getting a mismatch coming through that particular ratio, which will sort itself out because the higher fee base will give me you more operating performance going forward.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Barry Stowe (Executives)】\nIn page 102 in the supplements has the normal realignment to economic capital. We want to make sure we're consistent with the presentation. You asked a question on the impact of that allocation of trail commissions versus the front end commissions. It's coming from a couple of different things. It's coming from distributors. Different firms have different structures and so as the business is a little less independent channel. So you get a more firms that prefer and push towards, not necessarily levelized commission, but at least they'll be in some of the C share products. There is -- so that's just mix of who were selling through. That's in our pricing, so I wouldn't look for that to be an event, either way. The other element you get with that is point in the cycle. And so you tend to have age of advisors and how well the markets doing and how well they're doing they tend -- if the business is going well for retail advisor, they can to be thinking about deferring revenue and growing the value of their book. If it's a difficult time, you tend to see more A share in smaller practice, okay? So those are both factors, but again it's in our pricing. You had a third question, I'm sorry, I missed it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Farooq Hanif (Analysts)】\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nYou're right. So we have some additional experience contribution to free surplus this year compared to last. In part, that's coming through our spread profits. The same effect that you've seen on IFRS and on EEV is coming through that one. The second one is to do with one-off type tax credits that we've received over and above what we were counting and expecting at this point in the cycle. So that's what's driving, if you like, the slight blip. And this is why, when I was answering Andrew's question earlier, I said there are some elements in there that are one-off in nature in that result across our businesses, not just the U.S. Okay? We'll take 2 more because we're well into the lunch hour now and you know where to find us anyway.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nBefore we go, Andy and then Gordon.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Hughes (Analysts)】\nI have 3 questions, if I could. The first one is in the U.S. spread profits. And I think you're still making well over 220 basis points profit on the spread book and certainly that's going to come down to 200 in the short term. Where is the credit rate right now? Where is the reinvestment rate on the U.S. spread book? Just to tell me how far that's going to come down because it doesn't stabilize the 200 basis points. And second question was about the kind of tangible -- movement in tangible NAV of the group and obviously GBP 1.3 billion of net profit but if you look at the Page 57 at the back and goodwill segment, that kind of increased by GBP 1 billion. And so should we ignore kind of tangible metrics on the balance sheet? And the third question was about the kind of SCB transaction and obviously, could you give us some sort of cash flow payback period on that, even if you aren't prepared to disclose it or IRR that will be very helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nOkay, thank you. Another 3 good questions. We have that, I mean, the numbers on the crediting and the...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicolaos Nicandrou (Executives)】\nYes, I mean crediting rates are running around the 320 basis points level. We are -- I don't have the figure in terms of the reinvestment yield that we get on the maturing bonds. It will be [indiscernible]. 4.25, 4.5.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicolaos Nicandrou (Executives)】\nSo that's part of the pressure that we see bringing the number down.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Hughes (Analysts)】\nSo it should drop to 1% over time, that spread margin?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicolaos Nicandrou (Executives)】\nWell, it depends on mix. Remember, if you make the assumption that we've got our estimates of how long people will keep their money with us wrong, then it should do that. But remember people are saving for a purpose. They're saving because they're in their 60s and there comes a point where they want to de-accumulate. So I don't think the scenario would arise. That's the first point. The second point is that all the new monies coming in is coming in at either 1.5% on the fixed annuity or at 1% if you go fixed annuity option on VAs. So all of these things are working in a way that will -- we've done detailed complex calculation for you and we've translated into a very simple guidance of 200 basis points.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nMike, do you want to comment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael McLintock (Executives)】\nNic, the key point -- the products being sold, Andy, at this point of cycle, have a 1% floor, okay? So you're at a very different guarantee than you saw pre-crisis. You still have 23 to 25 basis points between our current crediting rates and the floor is on the entire book, so there's still plenty of room to move. And as we've told you we're high in quality, low in duration of the portfolio. Our ability to reinvest or just hold the duration on those positions, I think, is about as good as anybody in the industry. And in the scenario where the compressing -- if spreads never widen, our new sales would affect the equation you're throwing out there as well because you have different math on those.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nAll right, and there was then tangible net asset value, that goodwill, Nic, do you want to...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicolaos Nicandrou (Executives)】\nI think we've rehearsed this many, many time. The reality is there aspects of value which generates profits, IFRS profits that are not captured by shareholders equity. We gave the example earlier of the with-profit transfers. That's not -- Accounting convention today prevents us from recognizing that aspect in our results. A lot of what we write in Asia is health and protection. That's like writing GI business. We don't need a lot of tangible net assets to deliver a high return on a GI business. So I think -- so those are some of the dynamics that are coming through which is why you end up with an IFRS basis, equity basis, which is not representative of the income generation power of this organization.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nOn SCB, this is actually an interesting point because there used to be a strategy discussion in the group. The old view in Asia book was that bancassurance was less profitable than agency, so margins were lower. And that actually it wasn't a very desirable business. Well, in the way, we look at finance, good business is business that is written above its cost of capital. We don't run the group on margin. Actually, a lot of companies with high margins cannot grow because they fall into that trap of saying, well, if I do this, is going to dilute my margin and this is something that I fight with a passion because it's just wrong thinking. We are in the business of creating the maximum amount of value for our shareholders. And sometimes that involves going into a business with optically lower margins but you've seen that we've actually de-emphasized margins in all our communications to kind of root out that mentality. If we write the business above the cost of capital, we should absolutely do it. That creates value for our shareholder. So that's really how we approach it. So what I can tell you about the contract, that's been all negotiations. We are very confident that the return on capital will be comfortably -- and we've given the Board this comfort and it's been seen by everybody and the advisor. We'll be comfortably above the cost of capital. So it's going to be significantly value-enhancing for our shareholders. But frankly, there is no mileage -- again, think about shareholder value, not management comfort, in opening the hood of that, given what's going on in that region and the commercial dynamics, absolutely no upside. So it's not as, you know, I hope that we have been very transparent as a management team. Just have to look at thickness of the pack over the years, even more and more we opened -- we want you to understand how the group works and how we make money but from time to time, some of that disclosure can just be completely counterproductive. So in the current environment, you will be able to track our progress. You will see some of it flowing from the IGD as in all the disclosures that are coming later in the year, but we just -- we think we really have a -- how can I say this, a competitive advantage where, in our understanding of those transactions and structuring the payments. And as much as we'd like to answer your questions, we don't want to make that available to the competition. I spent enough time myself reading all their presentation of all the peers, so that they do the same thing. You can easily slip a lot of very valuable commercial information doing that. So that's what limit to the transparency. We're not being difficult because we don't want to discuss things that are going to be played back against us later. One last question?  You go three. You go by sets of three. So another three questions, for arithmetic. Okay, Gordon go ahead.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gordon Aitken (Analysts)】\nJust two, Tidjane. Gordon Aitken from RBC. So first question is on the holding company cash. It's gone up to GBP 2.2 billion, it's a big jump from GBP 1.4 billion and as you raise the GBP 700 million of hybrid debt in December. And you've shown today that you don't need the cash to grow the balance sheet is strong. I'm just wondering what that cash will be used for? And second question on the U.K. I mean this week you've announced the GBP 100 million buy-in with the Church of England scheme. I mean the bulk market there's a very good demand. There's really lack of supply and you presumably expect margins to remain very positive in that market. Just what sort of appetite do you have in the bulk market going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nAll right, thank you, Gordon for only 2 questions. Do you want to say a word about the cash balance at the center?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicolaos Nicandrou (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, we touched on that in December. I mean candidly, the one good thing about the low-interest rate environment is that you can raise a very high-quality debt. We've been able to raise very long debt at very attractive prices so we took that opportunity, that opportunity is not going to be available forever. We've locked that in and that gives us, I guess, also all sorts of flexibility as we move forward to either pay some of the debt that we carry or to deploy in other areas.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nYes, and just transactions like SCB, which I know you have a lot of interest in the cash payment but we want to have that flexibility and believe me, it's comfortable to be able to go into most types of conversations with no real cash, no real cash  constraint. That's very comfortable. Jackie, do you want to talk about the bulks and the recent buying?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jacqueline Hunt (Executives)】\nSo Gordon you're absolutely right. I think a recent deal has been publicly announced by a counterparty. In terms of the market itself, I would see it very similarly to how you set it out. I think there's a great deal of demand or opportunity. I think supply has become relatively constrained until we do see some interesting deals coming to the market back end of last year and certainly in the first quarter of this year. I talked into December about the opportunity we had to put this bit more fully. We've got some key competencies, we've got a great brand that's really important to our counterparties and they deal with the business that has a good reputation. We tend to deal at the top end, so above GBP 100 million. That sort of range in large part. These are more complex deals and we have the capabilities to perhaps participate in deals that some others may not. So we see it as an attractive opportunity. We are very disciplined about how we actually use our capacity, obviously, these do bring with them longevity risks and other types of risks that we do want to make sure we get a proper return against. So you should expect to see us participating more aggressively, but within the constraints of very strict capital return hurdles. We certainly won't let go of that particular discipline.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nWell, Jackie has a very balanced portfolio because she is also in charge of Africa. She's got 2 very different jobs. So thank you, thank you very much for your patience. In this team, many of us have seen GBP 2. I remember seeing GBP 1.95. So to close above GBP 14 is a good day but please keep in mind as we hope we showed you with plenty of potential and upside here. So I leave you with that thought and thank you very much.

      "transcript_text1": "Good morning, and welcome to our presentation of our 2014 interim results. As usual, Jonathan will take you through our financial performance, and I'll then provide an update of our businesses and the strategic progress we've made in the first half. After the formal presentation, we'll be available to take any questions.\r\nBefore I hand over to Jonathan, I'd first like to share with you the highlights of our performance in the first half of the year. The group continues to perform strongly. We delivered adjusted operating profit growth of 21%, GBP 97 million, in the period, with all 3 divisions contributing to the improved performance. As a result, adjusted earnings per share increased 19% to 50p.\r\nImportantly, we continued to deliver strong returns while maintaining our high-quality balance sheet and strong capital position. In the period, reporting for the first time under CRD IV, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio remained strong at 13.2%, while we improved the group's return on opening equity to 18%.\r\nFinally, I'm pleased to say that this morning, we've announced a 10% increase in the interim dividend to 16.5p. Overall, we remain well-positioned for growth, as I'll discuss later on.\r\nI'll now hand over to Jonathan.\n\n---\n\nGood morning, everyone, and I thank your presence. I'll now take you through our performance for the first half.\r\nAs you can see, we have delivered a strong result for the period. Overall, we have reported a 21% increase in adjusted operating profit to GBP 97 million. All 3 divisions increased their contribution to group profits. The bank is up 14% to GBP 90 million, driven by good loan book growth and lower bad debts. Securities profits increased by 58% to GBP 17 million. And Winterflood's profits grew by 81%, as trading conditions improved against the subdued first half in the prior year.\r\nAsset Management continued to make progress, with adjusted operating profit of GBP 3 million. Finally, net group expenses increased to GBP 12 million, but the prior period included one-off income of GBP 2 million.\r\nLooking now at the income statements in more detail. We've recorded a 14% rise in income, driven by good loan book growth in the bank, and improved investor risk appetite in securities. Expense income ratio has remained stable at 63%, as operating expenses increased by 14% to GBP 203 million. We've continued to invest in the bank to support further growth, and in securities, variable expenses increased as revenue improved.\r\nThe tax charge was GBP 22 million, corresponding to an effective tax rate of 23%. As a result, adjusted earnings per share increased by 19% to 50.4p. And we declared an interim dividend of 16.5p, an increase of 10% from last year, reflecting the strong earnings in the period.\r\nThe balance sheet continues to be simple and transparent, principally comprising assets and liabilities relating to lending activities in our banking division. The loan book and treasury assets account for over 80% of the group's total assets. The loan book grew by GBP 200 million or 5% to GBP 4.9 billion in the first half. The risk profile of the loan book has remained consistent, principally the short-term around 90% secured and with prudent loan-to-value ratios.\r\nTreasury assets decreased slightly to about GBP 900 million. They represent our holding of high-quality liquid assets, principally deposits with the Bank of England. Our liquidity position remains strong and comfortably ahead of regulatory requirements. The securities assets, which include short-term settlement balances and trading positions increased GBP 200 million to around GBP 800 million, reflecting increased trading activity immediately preceding the balance sheet date. These assets are largely offset by related liabilities, with the net position remaining broadly stable at around GBP 100 million. Overall total assets increased by 4% to GBP 7.1 billion in the first half.\r\nWe have maintained our strong funding position with its emphasis on diversity and prudence. In the first, total funding increased to GBP 6.4 billion, covering a sum of 132% of the loan book at the balance sheet date. This reflects continued growth in our cost of deposits which increased by GBP 135 million to GBP 4.1 billion. Our term funding over 1 year remains stable at GBP 3.4 billion, this remains a prudent level relative to the loan book, which was 71% covered by term funding at the balance sheet date. And the average maturity of the term funding of 23 months continues to comfortably exceed the loan book at 13 months.\r\nWe are reporting for the first time under CRD IV. The group's capital remains strong with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 13.2% and a leverage ratio at 9.3%, despite continuing growth in the loan book. The impact of CRD IV is broadly neutral. The group has taken the benefit of the discount for SME lending, but this has been offset by new deduction for foreseeable dividends. This arises from new regulations which apply to the whole banking industry.\r\nThe reduction in common equity Tier 1 capital to GBP 670 million is largely due to the new foreseeable dividend deduction. This is calculated by taking the group average payout ratio over a 3-year period, and applying it for the first half earnings. We remain focused on holding an appropriate level of capital and continue to monitor and manage capital resources carefully.\r\nThe banking division delivered a good performance in the first half, as the loan book continue to grow and bad debts improved. Income increased by 11% to GBP 218 million, principally due to a 10% increase in net interest and fees on the loan book. Cost increased by 15% to GBP 106 million, as we continue to invest in our business to support growth. This included additional volume-related costs, including increased head count in both the front and back office, to continue to support our customer proposition and infrastructure investments to ensure our technology remains robust and secure. Overall, the bank's expense income ratio increased slightly to 48%.\r\nThe strong credit performance across the portfolio has meant the bad debt charges on the loan book reduced by 12% to GBP 23 million. Overall, profit increased 14% to GBP 90 million, and the return on equity of the division, increased to 25%. This reflects our strong returns, but also improved balance sheet efficiency and lower tax rates.\r\nThe loan book has grown by 5% to GBP 4.9 billion in the first half, and by 11% over the last 12 months. The growth rates has remained good, with record levels of new business, although net growth have slightly moderated from the prior year as expected. The retail loan book increased 5% to GBP 2 billion, primarily driven by growth in major finance. We've continued to see good demand for second hand call finance, although this has been offset by an increase in competition.\r\nThe premium finance book also increased in the period, with growth across the book. Commercial grew by 3% to GBP 1.9 billion, driven by asset finance, with good growth in SME lending in particular. The invoice finance book reduced in the period, principally due to a seasonal decline in demand in January. Growth in the property loan book was 6% to GBP 1 billion as we continue to benefit from good demand and limited competition.\r\nOur distinctive model has continued to drive our consistently strong returns. The net interest margin has remained stable at 8.8%, as the mix of our business has remained broadly unchanged. The bad debt ratio has continued to fall, and is now 1%. The further reduction in the first half was principally driven by improved credit performance in property and asset finance. Overall, the return on net loan book increased to 3.8%, driven by the continued reduction in the bad debt ratio.\r\nNow turning to the Securities division, where adjusted operating profit increased 58% to GBP 17 million, reflecting improved market sentiment from retail investors. Winterflood has maintained its trading capacity throughout the difficult market conditions in the last 2 years. As a result, it has benefited from recovering risk appetite, and adjusted operating profit increased 81% to GBP 13 million in the period. Seydler's profits also improved to GBP 3 million. As a result, the division's return on equity improved to 25%, up from 16% in the prior period. \r\nWinterflood's performance improved in the first half as we saw better trading conditions, particularly, in AIM. Trading performance was again consistent with just 1 loss day in the period. Income increased by 39% to GBP 48 million, profit also increased by 28% to GBP 35 million, reflecting higher performance-related costs, which were driven by the improved trading. Average bargains per day increased to 52,000, up from 42,000 in the first half of 2013, but stable on the second half. The income per bargain improved to GBP 7.20 in the first half due to the change in mix towards higher margin sectors.\r\nNow turning to Asset Management, where we continue to make good progress. We recorded good income growth of 9%, principally, in investment management as we continue to grow assets under management. We've continued to control costs, which increased only modestly to GBP 37 million. Overall, adjusted operating profit increased to GBP 3 million.\r\nAuM increased by 2% to GBP 9.3 billion in the first half with positive net flows. We maintained good sales momentum as growth inflows amounted to GBP 590 million in the period. These inflows were partially offset by total outflows of GBP 400 million. This resulted in positive net flows of about GBP 190 million, equating to a growth rate of just over 4% on an annualized basis. In addition, we saw slightly positive market movements of about GBP 25 million.\r\nNow looking at the components of AuM in more detail, total managed assets increased by 5% to GBP 6.5 billion, reflecting good inflows and consistent good fund performance. Total advice assets were broadly stable at GBP 5 billion, as we saw modest outflows in the period. However managed and advised  assets increased by 3% to GBP 2.3 billion. This increase is important for our integrated proposition, as managed and advised assets generated twice investment management and the platform income. These assets now represents 45% of total advised AuM.\r\nThank you, and now I'll hand back to Preben.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Jonathan. Before I talk about our 3 divisions in greater detail, I wanted to highlight key aspects of our strategy, which reflect our modern merchant banking principles, and underpin Close Brothers' strong competitive positioning.\r\nThe group has maintained a strong financial position through the cycle, and we've always recognized the need to maintain a strong balance sheet and capital position. This approach has served us well in recent years, and we came through the financial crisis without needing to recapitalize or cut our dividend. As Jonathan said, we take a prudent approach to managing our balance sheet, and had been able to continue to invest and grow all of our businesses while maintaining our capital position and increasing our dividend.\r\nWe continue to benefit from applying a consistent strategy, and our clear business models have supported sustainable growth in all market conditions. We serve niche markets that require specialist's expert knowledge and an in-depth understanding of our client's needs. In particular, as a small but growing financial services group, we differentiate ourselves through our prudent approach, lending on a predominantly secured basis and through our focus on returns, not volume-driven growth.\r\nWhile we operate within an established model, and we will not change that model, we're always enhancing and optimizing our business processes, and we're continually improving our technology and customer service. In particular, we believe we remain able to implement change effectively across the group. We're large enough to have the resources to invest, but small enough for change and technological development to have a meaningful impact across the business.\r\nFor example, in Banking, we've consolidated and upgraded our IT infrastructure across the entire division. A project that will be expensive for many of our smaller peers and complex for many of our larger peers to undertake effectively. Similarly, in Winterflood, a significant proportion of our employees are focused on IT and in-house development, supporting our leading market-making position. In Asset Management, we've invested in our platform technology, and we're working with our financial advisors to increase their capacity to enhance our client offering.\r\nLastly, we continue to benefit from our customer proposition across the group, supported by emphasis on client service. Our specialist teams develop close relationships with their clients, helped by a local presence in many of our markets. While many other firms have moved to centralized models, our bank has maintained a decentralized model, and we continue to strengthen our distribution network.\r\nOur lenders operate out of nearly 50 locations, enabling us to build stronger, more focused relationships with our customers and intermediaries. Similarly, in Winterflood, our specialist proprietary technology, enables us to develop flexible, client-led trading solutions, while in Asset Management, our local model is supported by our national network of 10 regional offices. Overall, we retain the culture and characteristics of a focused local merchant banking group, and we believe that our financial principles and cultural values, that have served us well in the past, will continue to serve us well into the future.\r\nOur strong market position and consistent lending principles in banking have enabled us to deliver sustainable loan book growth in all market conditions. Of course, the rate at which we can grow continued to reflect developments in our lending market and our growth rate remains sensitive to changes in credit supply and demand. When we last updated you in September, we were seeing signs of competition returning as we expected.\r\nSticking to our lending model and not changing our strict lending criteria, resulted in our loan growth moderating from the very high rate we enjoyed during the financial crisis, when credit supply was very constricted. However, as we stand today, the market remains fragmented. There's still very few specialist lenders in our space. Many of the banks we used to compete with remained constrained and continue to have a reduced presence in our markets, while very few new entrants have the expertise and distribution in our niche areas.\r\nAs the graph shows, we've consistently grown our loan, but even during times of easy credit. Moreover, given changes to the regulatory landscape, we think it's unlikely growth in credit supply will reach the same levels we saw during those periods anytime soon. We've also not yet seen broad -- a broad-based increase in SME demand, but we remain well-positioned to benefit when this improves.\r\nOverall, we have a strong long-term market position. It's taken us nearly 30 years to grow our loan book to its current level of nearly GBP 5 billion, and our track record gives us confidence that future growth can be sustained. We lend to SMEs and individuals against a diverse range of assets, which provides us with wide-ranging opportunities across different markets.\r\nI've talked about growth, but our position in the U.K. banking market is very distinctive, not only because of our lending model, but also because of our continued strong performance and returns. I'm sure you're familiar with the model, but to summarize briefly, we're predominantly a secured lender, and we apply prudent loan-to-value ratios to our lending. Around 90% of our loan book is secured, and we keep our loans short-term and small in size.\r\nFurther, we provide our customers with a highly differentiated proposition, which supports our strong margins. We build long-term customer relationships and have demonstrated commitment to our customers through the cycle. Our specialist sales teams presents expert knowledge of our assets, markets and customers, and have local autonomy, enabling them to provide flexible lending solutions and make fast decisions.\r\nWe also continue to benefit from our credit control, based on strong underwriting disciplines, predictable stable arrears and effective recoveries. Overall, we've continued to improve our returns in the period. Our return on net loan book increased to 3.8%, and our return on opening equity improved to 25%. We have a clear model built over 30 years which is not easily replicated. This supports our strong market position, and we remain confident that we'll continue to grow.\r\nLet's turn to Winterflood. Market conditions improved in the first half, following difficult trading conditions over the last 2 years. The majority of our order flow comes through retail brokers and therefore, Winterflood's performance is strongly correlated to retail investor sentiment. A number of positive market changes over the last 6 months have contributed to a shift in sentiment, and encourage retail investors to increase their risk appetite. Improving primary market activity can be supportive of increased secondary market activity.\r\nAnd in 2013, the number of IPOs in the U.K. increased for the strong pipeline for the current year. In particular, new listings on the AIM market where Winterflood generates higher-margin trading, were at their highest level since 2007. In the same way, tax changes such as the evolution of stamp duty on AIM shares, as well as their inclusion within ISAs, may also have helped to increase risk appetite, by encouraging retail investors to trade less liquid small cap stocks. While none of these changes alone will have had a material impact on Winterflood's performance, they're all potential catalysts for more general improvement in retail investor sentiment.\r\nClearly, trading behavior and risk appetite remains susceptible to economic conditions and events. While average daily retail market volumes have improved as the chart shows, they continue to be lower than the levels we saw at the peak of the last cycle. Similarly, equity markets have rallied but remained volatile. Winterflood is a daily business, and while we see the immediate benefits from improving market conditions, sentiment and risk appetite can change quickly. The last 6 months have been a strong period for equity market, but as we all know, trading conditions remain susceptible to external events, such as last October when markets was subdued during the U.S. debt ceiling and budget debate.\r\nWinterflood is a cyclical business, and has responded as expected to better conditions with an improved first half performance. Despite periods of volatility, we reported just 1 loss day out of 128 trading days in the period, reflecting the skill of our market makers. In particular, we benefited from continuing to concentrate on our core market-making activities, and from maintaining our trading capacity in weaker markets\r\nWe've also continued to invest in our leading market proprietary technology to provide the best prices and execution for our clients. Technology plays a key part in the success of Winterflood, and we invest considerably in this area, with around 20% of our employees focused on technology and in-house development. Our fast and resilient electronic trading systems can be customized to the specific requirements of our clients, which include 300 retail and 150 institutional clients. \r\nOverall, we've maintained our market-leading position. Trading conditions are improving, although we're not yet near the levels of performance we saw in 2010 and 2011. However, while it remains difficult to predict future market behavior, Winterflood is clearly well-positioned to benefit if sentiment continues to improve.\r\nFinally, turning to Asset Management. We're seeing significant developments in the U.K. Wealth Management market. And I'd just like to highlight the strength of our core client proposition and describe our business model in more detail, to help demonstrate how we're well-positioned going forward. Our strategy is founded on our core belief that it's important for everyone to have a financial plan. The value of the financial plan lies in identifying the actions clients need to take today in order to secured the lifestyle they want in the future. The cost of not taking action early and losing the benefits of planning opportunities can be significant and can grow over time.\r\nTherefore, we've built our proposition to provide clients with everything they need to create, implement and review their financial plan at any stage of their life. We have developed a vertically integrated model, founded on our core capabilities of financial planning, advice, research, investment management and platform technology, all enabling clients to choose the services they require according to their personal preference. Our professional advisors assist clients in developing their financial plan. This is broad in scope, and covers forecasting lifetime earnings, expenditure and retirement income. We help clients establish a long-term investment strategy, and assist with tax and pension solutions, insurance to protect against key risks, as well as a estate planning for the next-generation.\r\nAlongside this, we provide global diversified investment management across all liquid asset classes to a range of investment vehicles. These include our own funds, model portfolios, and a fully bespoke service for our high-net-worth clients. Our platform technology provides clients with a consolidated picture of their wealth. We've designed these capabilities to work in tandem, and to deliver comprehensive and integrated approach for the clients.\r\nIn particular, we believe our range of capabilities and the flexibility of our proposition is differentiated and well-suited to the current environment. We develop strong credentials in our markets and are building scale in the business. We have over 120 financial advisors and 50 investment professionals, managing over GBP 9 billion of client assets. We remain focused on building, enduring long-term relationships with our clients, and we'll benefit as they increase their assets over time.\r\nUltimately, we earn revenue from several sources: Advice, investment management and our platform, which maximizes our profit potential per client, and provides significant scalability, particularly in investment management and through our platform.\r\nNow looking at the last 6 months, the division has continued to make progress towards our profitability target. We continue to build scale, growing assets under management in the period, and seeing solid demand for our products, reflecting the quality of our integrated proposition. We're benefiting from investment and distribution, and are seeing good growth, particularly in our managed AuM. Supported by the strong performance to our funds, we continue to see good demand for our close discretionary fund range, which provides a cost-effective way to access professional investment management for both our own and  third party advisors.\r\nImportantly, none of our distribution channels have reached maturity, and we expect continued growth across our proposition as we build scale. Lastly, we continue to make progress towards our medium-term profitability target, as well as benefiting from operating leverage as we build scale, we're also focused on improving the efficiency of our advice process for clients.\r\nThe revenue margin increased slightly in the period and we expect this to improve over time depending upon the business mix. We're confident we'll continue to increase our operating margin, and are on track to achieve our 15% target by 2015.\r\nSo to conclude, our business model, strong performance and financial position, ensure that we're well-placed going forward. We're confident in our strategy, seeing good opportunities for growth, and we'll continue to deliver strong returns for our shareholders. In Banking, we expect to continue to deliver good growth at attractive margins. Winterflood is well-positioned to continue to benefit from a stronger cyclical recovery. And in Asset Management, we continue to make progress as the business builds scale. Overall, we remain confident in the outlook for the year.\r\nWe now look forward to answering any questions you may have. As well as to Jonathan and myself, we have Stephen Hodges from Banking, Julian Palfreyman from Winterflood, and Martin Andrew from Asset Management, who will also be happy to take any questions. As usual, could you please state your name and company before asking a question.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nGood morning, and welcome to our presentation of our 2014 interim results. As usual, Jonathan will take you through our financial performance, and I'll then provide an update of our businesses and the strategic progress we've made in the first half. After the formal presentation, we'll be available to take any questions.\r\nBefore I hand over to Jonathan, I'd first like to share with you the highlights of our performance in the first half of the year. The group continues to perform strongly. We delivered adjusted operating profit growth of 21%, GBP 97 million, in the period, with all 3 divisions contributing to the improved performance. As a result, adjusted earnings per share increased 19% to 50p.\r\nImportantly, we continued to deliver strong returns while maintaining our high-quality balance sheet and strong capital position. In the period, reporting for the first time under CRD IV, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio remained strong at 13.2%, while we improved the group's return on opening equity to 18%.\r\nFinally, I'm pleased to say that this morning, we've announced a 10% increase in the interim dividend to 16.5p. Overall, we remain well-positioned for growth, as I'll discuss later on.\r\nI'll now hand over to Jonathan.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Jonathan Howell (Executives)】\nGood morning, everyone, and I thank your presence. I'll now take you through our performance for the first half.\r\nAs you can see, we have delivered a strong result for the period. Overall, we have reported a 21% increase in adjusted operating profit to GBP 97 million. All 3 divisions increased their contribution to group profits. The bank is up 14% to GBP 90 million, driven by good loan book growth and lower bad debts. Securities profits increased by 58% to GBP 17 million. And Winterflood's profits grew by 81%, as trading conditions improved against the subdued first half in the prior year.\r\nAsset Management continued to make progress, with adjusted operating profit of GBP 3 million. Finally, net group expenses increased to GBP 12 million, but the prior period included one-off income of GBP 2 million.\r\nLooking now at the income statements in more detail. We've recorded a 14% rise in income, driven by good loan book growth in the bank, and improved investor risk appetite in securities. Expense income ratio has remained stable at 63%, as operating expenses increased by 14% to GBP 203 million. We've continued to invest in the bank to support further growth, and in securities, variable expenses increased as revenue improved.\r\nThe tax charge was GBP 22 million, corresponding to an effective tax rate of 23%. As a result, adjusted earnings per share increased by 19% to 50.4p. And we declared an interim dividend of 16.5p, an increase of 10% from last year, reflecting the strong earnings in the period.\r\nThe balance sheet continues to be simple and transparent, principally comprising assets and liabilities relating to lending activities in our banking division. The loan book and treasury assets account for over 80% of the group's total assets. The loan book grew by GBP 200 million or 5% to GBP 4.9 billion in the first half. The risk profile of the loan book has remained consistent, principally the short-term around 90% secured and with prudent loan-to-value ratios.\r\nTreasury assets decreased slightly to about GBP 900 million. They represent our holding of high-quality liquid assets, principally deposits with the Bank of England. Our liquidity position remains strong and comfortably ahead of regulatory requirements. The securities assets, which include short-term settlement balances and trading positions increased GBP 200 million to around GBP 800 million, reflecting increased trading activity immediately preceding the balance sheet date. These assets are largely offset by related liabilities, with the net position remaining broadly stable at around GBP 100 million. Overall total assets increased by 4% to GBP 7.1 billion in the first half.\r\nWe have maintained our strong funding position with its emphasis on diversity and prudence. In the first, total funding increased to GBP 6.4 billion, covering a sum of 132% of the loan book at the balance sheet date. This reflects continued growth in our cost of deposits which increased by GBP 135 million to GBP 4.1 billion. Our term funding over 1 year remains stable at GBP 3.4 billion, this remains a prudent level relative to the loan book, which was 71% covered by term funding at the balance sheet date. And the average maturity of the term funding of 23 months continues to comfortably exceed the loan book at 13 months.\r\nWe are reporting for the first time under CRD IV. The group's capital remains strong with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 13.2% and a leverage ratio at 9.3%, despite continuing growth in the loan book. The impact of CRD IV is broadly neutral. The group has taken the benefit of the discount for SME lending, but this has been offset by new deduction for foreseeable dividends.

This is calculated by taking the group average payout ratio over a 3-year period, and applying it for the first half earnings. We remain focused on holding an appropriate level of capital and continue to monitor and manage capital resources carefully.\r\nThe banking division delivered a good performance in the first half, as the loan book continue to grow and bad debts improved. Income increased by 11% to GBP 218 million, principally due to a 10% increase in net interest and fees on the loan book. Cost increased by 15% to GBP 106 million, as we continue to invest in our business to support growth. This included additional volume-related costs, including increased head count in both the front and back office, to continue to support our customer proposition and infrastructure investments to ensure our technology remains robust and secure. Overall, the bank's expense income ratio increased slightly to 48%.\r\nThe strong credit performance across the portfolio has meant the bad debt charges on the loan book reduced by 12% to GBP 23 million. Overall, profit increased 14% to GBP 90 million, and the return on equity of the division, increased to 25%. This reflects our strong returns, but also improved balance sheet efficiency and lower tax rates.\r\nThe loan book has grown by 5% to GBP 4.9 billion in the first half, and by 11% over the last 12 months. The growth rates has remained good, with record levels of new business, although net growth have slightly moderated from the prior year as expected. The retail loan book increased 5% to GBP 2 billion, primarily driven by growth in major finance.

The net interest margin has remained stable at 8.8%, as the mix of our business has remained broadly unchanged. The bad debt ratio has continued to fall, and is now 1%. The further reduction in the first half was principally driven by improved credit performance in property and asset finance. Overall, the return on net loan book increased to 3.8%, driven by the continued reduction in the bad debt ratio.\r\nNow turning to the Securities division, where adjusted operating profit increased 58% to GBP 17 million, reflecting improved market sentiment from retail investors.

Income increased by 39% to GBP 48 million, profit also increased by 28% to GBP 35 million, reflecting higher performance-related costs, which were driven by the improved trading. Average bargains per day increased to 52,000, up from 42,000 in the first half of 2013, but stable on the second half. The income per bargain improved to GBP 7.20 in the first half due to the change in mix towards higher margin sectors.\r\nNow turning to Asset Management, where we continue to make good progress. We recorded good income growth of 9%, principally, in investment management as we continue to grow assets under management. We've continued to control costs, which increased only modestly to GBP 37 million. Overall, adjusted operating profit increased to GBP 3 million.\r\nAuM increased by 2% to GBP 9.3 billion in the first half with positive net flows. We maintained good sales momentum as growth inflows amounted to GBP 590 million in the period. These inflows were partially offset by total outflows of GBP 400 million.

We're large enough to have the resources to invest, but small enough for change and technological development to have a meaningful impact across the business.\r\nFor example, in Banking, we've consolidated and upgraded our IT infrastructure across the entire division. A project that will be expensive for many of our smaller peers and complex for many of our larger peers to undertake effectively. Similarly, in Winterflood, a significant proportion of our employees are focused on IT and in-house development, supporting our leading market-making position. In Asset Management, we've invested in our platform technology, and we're working with our financial advisors to increase their capacity to enhance our client offering.\r\nLastly, we continue to benefit from our customer proposition across the group, supported by emphasis on client service. Our specialist teams develop close relationships with their clients, helped by a local presence in many of our markets. While many other firms have moved to centralized models, our bank has maintained a decentralized model, and we continue to strengthen our distribution network.\r\nOur lenders operate out of nearly 50 locations, enabling us to build stronger, more focused relationships with our customers and intermediaries. Similarly, in Winterflood, our specialist proprietary technology, enables us to develop flexible, client-led trading solutions, while in Asset Management, our local model is supported by our national network of 10 regional offices. Overall, we retain the culture and characteristics of a focused local merchant banking group, and we believe that our financial principles and cultural values, that have served us well in the past, will continue to serve us well into the future.\r\nOur strong market position and consistent lending principles in banking have enabled us to deliver sustainable loan book growth in all market conditions. Of course, the rate at which we can grow continued to reflect developments in our lending market and our growth rate remains sensitive to changes in credit supply and demand. When we last updated you in September, we were seeing signs of competition returning as we expected.\r\nSticking to our lending model and not changing our strict lending criteria, resulted in our loan growth moderating from the very high rate we enjoyed during the financial crisis, when credit supply was very constricted. However, as we stand today, the market remains fragmented. There's still very few specialist lenders in our space. Many of the banks we used to compete with remained constrained and continue to have a reduced presence in our markets, while very few new entrants have the expertise and distribution in our niche areas.\r\nAs the graph shows, we've consistently grown our loan, but even during times of easy credit. Moreover, given changes to the regulatory landscape, we think it's unlikely growth in credit supply will reach the same levels we saw during those periods anytime soon. We've also not yet seen broad -- a broad-based increase in SME demand, but we remain well-positioned to benefit when this improves.\r\nOverall, we have a strong long-term market position. It's taken us nearly 30 years to grow our loan book to its current level of nearly GBP 5 billion, and our track record gives us confidence that future growth can be sustained. We lend to SMEs and individuals against a diverse range of assets, which provides us with wide-ranging opportunities across different markets.\r\nI've talked about growth, but our position in the U.K. banking market is very distinctive, not only because of our lending model, but also because of our continued strong performance and returns. I'm sure you're familiar with the model, but to summarize briefly, we're predominantly a secured lender, and we apply prudent loan-to-value ratios to our lending. Around 90% of our loan book is secured, and we keep our loans short-term and small in size.\r\nFurther, we provide our customers with a highly differentiated proposition, which supports our strong margins. We build long-term customer relationships and have demonstrated commitment to our customers through the cycle. Our specialist sales teams presents expert knowledge of our assets, markets and customers, and have local autonomy, enabling them to provide flexible lending solutions and make fast decisions.\r\nWe also continue to benefit from our credit control, based on strong underwriting disciplines, predictable stable arrears and effective recoveries. Overall, we've continued to improve our returns in the period. Our return on net loan book increased to 3.8%, and our return on opening equity improved to 25%. We have a clear model built over 30 years which is not easily replicated. This supports our strong market position, and we remain confident that we'll continue to grow.\r\nLet's turn to Winterflood. Market conditions improved in the first half, following difficult trading conditions over the last 2 years. The majority of our order flow comes through retail brokers and therefore, Winterflood's performance is strongly correlated to retail investor sentiment. A number of positive market changes over the last 6 months have contributed to a shift in sentiment, and encourage retail investors to increase their risk appetite. Improving primary market activity can be supportive of increased secondary market activity.\r\nAnd in 2013, the number of IPOs in the U.K. increased for the strong pipeline for the current year. In particular, new listings on the AIM market where Winterflood generates higher-margin trading, were at their highest level since 2007. In the same way, tax changes such as the evolution of stamp duty on AIM shares, as well as their inclusion within ISAs, may also have helped to increase risk appetite, by encouraging retail investors to trade less liquid small cap stocks. While none of these changes alone will have had a material impact on Winterflood's performance, they're all potential catalysts for more general improvement in retail investor sentiment.\r\nClearly, trading behavior and risk appetite remains susceptible to economic conditions and events. While average daily retail market volumes have improved as the chart shows, they continue to be lower than the levels we saw at the peak of the last cycle. Similarly, equity markets have rallied but remained volatile. Winterflood is a daily business, and while we see the immediate benefits from improving market conditions, sentiment and risk appetite can change quickly. The last 6 months have been a strong period for equity market, but as we all know, trading conditions remain susceptible to external events, such as last October when markets was subdued during the U.S. debt ceiling and budget debate.\r\nWinterflood is a cyclical business, and has responded as expected to better conditions with an improved first half performance. Despite periods of volatility, we reported just 1 loss day out of 128 trading days in the period, reflecting the skill of our market makers. In particular, we benefited from continuing to concentrate on our core market-making activities, and from maintaining our trading capacity in weaker markets\r\nWe've also continued to invest in our leading market proprietary technology to provide the best prices and execution for our clients. Technology plays a key part in the success of Winterflood, and we invest considerably in this area, with around 20% of our employees focused on technology and in-house development. Our fast and resilient electronic trading systems can be customized to the specific requirements of our clients, which include 300 retail and 150 institutional clients. \r\nOverall, we've maintained our market-leading position. Trading conditions are improving, although we're not yet near the levels of performance we saw in 2010 and 2011. However, while it remains difficult to predict future market behavior, Winterflood is clearly well-positioned to benefit if sentiment continues to improve.\r\nFinally, turning to Asset Management. We're seeing significant developments in the U.K. Wealth Management market. And I'd just like to highlight the strength of our core client proposition and describe our business model in more detail, to help demonstrate how we're well-positioned going forward. Our strategy is founded on our core belief that it's important for everyone to have a financial plan. The value of the financial plan lies in identifying the actions clients need to take today in order to secured the lifestyle they want in the future. The cost of not taking action early and losing the benefits of planning opportunities can be significant and can grow over time.\r\nTherefore, we've built our proposition to provide clients with everything they need to create, implement and review their financial plan at any stage of their life. We have developed a vertically integrated model, founded on our core capabilities of financial planning, advice, research, investment management and platform technology, all enabling clients to choose the services they require according to their personal preference. Our professional advisors assist clients in developing their financial plan. This is broad in scope, and covers forecasting lifetime earnings, expenditure and retirement income. We help clients establish a long-term investment strategy, and assist with tax and pension solutions, insurance to protect against key risks, as well as a estate planning for the next-generation.\r\nAlongside this, we provide global diversified investment management across all liquid asset classes to a range of investment vehicles. These include our own funds, model portfolios, and a fully bespoke service for our high-net-worth clients. Our platform technology provides clients with a consolidated picture of their wealth. We've designed these capabilities to work in tandem, and to deliver comprehensive and integrated approach for the clients.\r\nIn particular, we believe our range of capabilities and the flexibility of our proposition is differentiated and well-suited to the current environment. We develop strong credentials in our markets and are building scale in the business. We have over 120 financial advisors and 50 investment professionals, managing over GBP 9 billion of client assets. We remain focused on building, enduring long-term relationships with our clients, and we'll benefit as they increase their assets over time.\r\nUltimately, we earn revenue from several sources: Advice, investment management and our platform, which maximizes our profit potential per client, and provides significant scalability, particularly in investment management and through our platform.\r\nNow looking at the last 6 months, the division has continued to make progress towards our profitability target. We continue to build scale, growing assets under management in the period, and seeing solid demand for our products, reflecting the quality of our integrated proposition. We're benefiting from investment and distribution, and are seeing good growth, particularly in our managed AuM. Supported by the strong performance to our funds, we continue to see good demand for our close discretionary fund range, which provides a cost-effective way to access professional investment management for both our own and  third party advisors.\r\nImportantly, none of our distribution channels have reached maturity, and we expect continued growth across our proposition as we build scale. Lastly, we continue to make progress towards our medium-term profitability target, as well as benefiting from operating leverage as we build scale, we're also focused on improving the efficiency of our advice process for clients.\r\nThe revenue margin increased slightly in the period and we expect this to improve over time depending upon the business mix. We're confident we'll continue to increase our operating margin, and are on track to achieve our 15% target by 2015.\r\nSo to conclude, our business model, strong performance and financial position, ensure that we're well-placed going forward. We're confident in our strategy, seeing good opportunities for growth, and we'll continue to deliver strong returns for our shareholders. In Banking, we expect to continue to deliver good growth at attractive margins. Winterflood is well-positioned to continue to benefit from a stronger cyclical recovery. And in Asset Management, we continue to make progress as the business builds scale. Overall, we remain confident in the outlook for the year.\r\nWe now look forward to answering any questions you may have. As well as to Jonathan and myself, we have Stephen Hodges from Banking, Julian Palfreyman from Winterflood, and Martin Andrew from Asset Management, who will also be happy to take any questions. As usual, could you please state your name and company before asking a question.",
      "transcript_text3": "Nitin Arora from HSBC. A couple of questions. Firstly, on Banking, when I look at the non-interest income, that has barely moved compared to last year, could you elaborate a bit more on why it has not changed? And then secondly, on Winterflood, as Preben, you highlighted that trading on AIM is similar to 2007 levels now, which should have helped you guys a lot, but if I look at the income per bargain, it is still running 30%, 40% behind 2010, '11, levels of GBP 10, GBP 11 per bargain. So if you could comment on why that has not picked up?\n\n---\n\nDo you want to take the non-interest income?\n\n---\n\nYes, yes. That line is -- includes treasury income. And what you see there is a temporary effect of us taking the benefit of reduced funding costs in the funding markets at the moment, before passing then on in a renewed blended rate for the loan books, and that is done on a periodic basis. That just represents a timing -- a temporary effect, and also represents the fact that we are seeing slightly improved rates that can be achieved in the funding market. Should we factor that into a change in the net interest margin? The answer is, no, for 2 reasons: One is, we are seeing increased competition across the book. The funding markets are benefiting everybody in the banking arena at the moment. And so therefore, much of that is effectively being passed through to customers. And secondly, it takes a long time for that blended rate to pass through to our book in its entirety. As you know, we effectively borrow long and lend short, the average term on our book over 12 months is 23 months, and therefore, it's going to take almost 2 years, until much of that benefit is passed through to at least some of the book. So that's what's caused it. Will it create a change in the net interest margin going forward? Our anticipation is that it will not.\n\n---\n\nOn the income per bargain, I think we've talked in the past about this being quite a crude measure, it's all income over all bargains. And if we look at these -- those 2 kind of component parts, the first 6 months was obviously much better than the equivalent period 1 year ago, but were still some way behind the income levels that we saw in 2010, 2011. In fact, we're at 25% to 30% below those income levels. So while it's a bounce back, I think you still need to recognize that it's only a bounce back compared to quite a poor level of 1 year ago. And I think on the other side, the number of bargains is also something that we just have talked about in the past. The number of bargains has increased over time. In fact, if you go back 5 years ago, I think the average on the London Stock Exchange, the average trade, was twice as big as it is now, GBP 13,000 compared to GBP 6,000. So every time we take on a client trade and we lay that off, we're doing it more times than we used to do, certainly, 4 or 5 years ago. So we're not yet at the income levels we were in 2010, '11, and we also have this kind of continued proliferation in the numbers of bargains that we use to lay off the trades that we take on, and that's why you have to be a bit careful about just tracking income per bargain as such a crude measure.\n\n---\n\nIt's Prasaanna Jeyanandhan from Berenberg. Just a quick question on costs, so first, given the revenue efforts across the group, I would have maybe expected a more operating leverage in the Banking business, and also maybe in Winterflood. And obviously, you've talked a little bit about the investment in infrastructure, the technology spend, I just want to get a little bit more guidance in terms of how you see that operating leverage benefits panning out in the coming years.\n\n---\n\nOn the Winter side, I think you do see the operating leverage, I mean it's a business, which has got manifestly variable costs as opposed to fixed cost. So compensation levels will go up as trading profits go up. And in a normalized year, that relationship is 2/3, 1/3, essentially, variable versus fixed cost. So I think you do see it there. I think in terms of operating leverage in the bank, it's all about what we're spending that is volume-related, and what we're spending which is investment related. Do you want to go into some detail on that one?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, just to reiterate on Winterflood. I mean, that cost model just hasn't changed at all over the last 10 years. And in fact, as Preben says, once you get up to the sort of the full level years of profitability, GBP 45 million to GBP 50 million, that relationship is about 2/3, 1/3 between fixed and variable, and that hasn't changed and should be consistent with cost, cost cycles that we've seen. In terms of the bank increase, that increase is volume-related, it is a high-touch, high-service, local model that we need to maintain in order to achieve those net interest margins running between 8.5% and 10%. And during the course of the year, we've taken on extra 90 to 100 heads in the bank to take us through to 1,700 people in total.  In terms of the other 1/3, that really is IT and infrastructure spend, it's part, coping with the significant growth that we've seen in the bank. If you go back to 2009, the loan book was GBP 2.4 billion, that's more than doubled in that period to GBP 4.9 billion, so we just need to make sure we've got greater IT capability and greater IT scalability. But also, a constant attention to upgrading the quality, the robustness and scalability of our IT. Just to give you an idea of some of the things that we've done and are currently doing, we have 12 separate data centers across the whole of the bank about 3 years ago, we've now migrated that into 2 states-of-the-art data centers. We've upgraded a completely new general ledger across the bank. We have previously 33 general ledgers, that's down to 1 now. We put in place, from scratch, a credit management information system, which enabled us to have central, a quantitative and qualitative oversight over lending decisions being made at all the local branches. And importantly, we're upgrading legacy systems in the property part of the business, and improving the finance part of the business. What are we doing currently now and going forward? Cyber security and general information security is another area of spend that we're involved in. And importantly and critically, we're taking considerable steps at the moment to have more technology at the point-of-sale within the bank. And a very good example is sort of the e-click in motor, where effectively now we're getting to a lending decision, which is almost paperless. And that sort of ties in with the way that the industry is going, it's great flexibility to the way which we dispense with our services. But also importantly, it illustrates greater sort of accuracy in the information, because it's being actually input at the point-of-sale, rather than subsequently off some sort of hard copy documentation. So to get to the sort of the question, can we see any significant change coming forward in that mix in the bank? Probably not. I'll point to the sort of the 10-year average of the cost income ratio of 49%; first half, we're about 48%, so we're in that type of range, 49% to 48% for the cost income ratio, and it reflects the nature of the business model that we have.\n\n---\n\nI think the point that we can't emphasize enough is that we need the kind of the investment to support the growth, but we also need the investment to make that safeguard. This is a, clearly, highly regulated period of time, and for us to ensure that we could continue to grow and do that safely, is actually going to continue to be a real competitive advantage, so this is investment well made.\n\n---\n\nIt's Gregory Simpson from UBS. Two questions. Firstly, back on Winterflood, when I look at the AIM volumes reported by the LSE, it looks like January and February have been significantly better than at other moments in the year. I mean, do you see that the short-term volumes of that transcribe through to Winterflood, or is it a slower process? And then secondly, on competition, you said it's coming back, but do you think it's starting to intensify now? I know Paragon announced they're opening a bank for car finance or [indiscernible] and focusing more on SME lending. And the tough markets, which you said, where competition are -- is least present, like property, that's where the strongest loan book growth is being seen. So I mean, are you seeing some activities to intensify, or is it still quite subdued?\n\n---\n\nOkay. On the first question, in terms of January and February trading on AIM, and whether or not that's reflected in Winterflood? Winterflood has a strong position on AIM. It's a leading player on AIM. It's good for Winterflood when AIM is seeing lots of volume, but it's a daily trading business. And so what we cannot do is to try and predict trends. All we can do is to point to the leadership position on the one hand, and then as you all know based on what you do, the IPO pipeline for the next period looks quite strong, but that's obviously subject to market conditions. And as I mentioned in my remarks, Winterflood doesn't do the IPOs, but it trades them, and it's good if that product is out there providing interest to investors. So we can only judge as it happens as opposed to looking forward, but they're very well-positioned. On the competition point, in the bank, overarchingly, we see that as patchy. So there are places where there is more than there was, motor is an example of that, the clearers are clearing more present in the motor business. There are a bit more present in large ticket property, but that tends to be larger than where we play. The likes of Lombard are more present in asset finance. But again, that tends to be in the slightly large ticket areas. And the startup banks are all looking to do what they can do in places like asset and invoice financing. And there, I think the issue is distribution, where we've obviously been at this for a very long time. We have a lot of people that are focused on distribution in the SME space, and that's clearly a comparative advantage. So it's increasing, but it's still fragmented, and it's still nothing like it was back in the '07 period.\n\n---\n\nArnaud Giblat from UBS. A couple of questions. Are there any new niche that you're exploring to grow into in the Banking business? And secondly, I'm just wondering if you could comment a bit more about the revenue per -- the profitability, the revenue margins in Asset Management, that has decelerated somewhat, where do you see those going, in time?\n\n---\n\nOkay. The -- in terms of new niches in the Banking business, we have always looked to expand into additional niches. And over a long period of time, we've done that. And what we want to do is to preserve the overall model that establishes the risk parameters that we have. We're overwhelmingly in smaller-ticket, shorter-term, secured high-margin lending, but that's not to say that we won't explore the edges and what might be available to us. And that could be high-margin retail, specialist retail lending. It could be more complicated, small project lending in new or alternative energy, for example. Those are 2 examples of where we might kind of look at the distribution curve of our lending. And both of them are interesting to us but they have to fall overall into the context of us sticking kind of fundamentally to the model. So we look at it all the time, basically, and we're constantly kind of challenging ourselves to push out the edges. In terms of the revenue margin in Asset Management, I think a bit of context here. In 2011, that revenue margin was 71 basis points. For the 6 months period 1 year ago, it was 84 basis points, it's 87 basis points now. We'll continue to see it increase over time. It will be partly a function of mix if we take on more managed assets, more high-net-worth assets in any period, then those are slightly lower margin. If we take on more new advice business in any period, that's slightly higher margin. So I think you'll see a gradual increase in the revenue margin, but it will depend on mix. It's an indicator of the performance of the business, not the only driver of the performance of the business. And what we obviously look at is the overall operating margin in the business. And we're looking to get operating leverage out of our investment in the business, and that's tracking very nicely, had a 9% increase in cost, 3% increase -- I'm sorry, 9% increase in income, 3% increase in costs this period, is what is driving that increase in profitability.\n\n---\n\nIt's Philip Middleton at Merrill. Just a couple of questions. Firstly, could you talk us through what you see the trajectory of the credit charge? Because it seems to me to be about as good as it gets? And I wonder if you could talk us through that in the context of the cycle we're in. And secondly, capital generation. I mean, your capital numbers are very strong, how do you see that panning out over the next few years? And how do you think about what you might do with that capital?\n\n---\n\nOkay. I think in terms of bad debt, and where we are there, we're at 1%. The 10-year average is 1.6%. The peak over a long period of time has been 2.6%, and in any 1 year, this is about as good as it has been. And I think that's right. So what's going on there? We're still see some improvements in property, because we had a legacy book which takes a while to work through, we still saw some improvements in asset finance, retail is about as low as it's going to get. So yes, we're at a long-term historical low point. On the other hand, as we look forward over the next few months, for example, we don't see a sudden spike in that happening anytime soon either.\n\n---\n\nAnd then on the sort of capital, thanks for that question, your attention to capital is always there, ever present. We are in a position now that, at this level of loan book growth that we've experienced and this level of overall group profitability, we are in an environment where capital will begin to accumulate, and all things being equal, and there are some small adjustments on that around Winterflood risk or Winter's market risk around the smooth CRD IV adjustments. Everything else being equal, we will begin to see the common equity Tier 1 ratio increase. And that contrasts to our results presentation 6 months ago, when I was asked the same question. And I said the patent level of group profitability of GBP 167 million, and that level of group loan book growth of 13%, that, all things being equal, we are about capital neutral. So we've just moved through that inflection point over the last 6 months, and that's quite important. And if we continue on the types of trends that we see, of the types of levels of loan book growth, and the types of level and increase and improvement in group profitability, our core -- our common equity Tier 1 ratio will increase. That is a gradual process, it's a process that will take a number of years. We want to be extremely well capitalized as we have been in the past to make sure that as a bank of our size that our capital integrity is without question. Secondly, we want to have a degree of flexibility to be able to go through very strong periods of organic growth that we just experienced when our Core Tier 1 equity ratio came down from about 15%, down to 12.5%. And lastly, we want to have the flexibility where appropriate, and if appropriate, to do any infill acquisitions in the Asset Management division. So once we've gone through that period of increasing capital and giving ourselves the flexibility to address those 3 things I just identified, at some stage, we will have a question. And clearly, we'll look at that question in a very, very economic way. But that, I hasten to add, is a good period of time off, and that we expect is months or years. Any other question? Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\nThank you.",

In terms of the other 1/3, that really is IT and infrastructure spend, it's part, coping with the significant growth that we've seen in the bank. If you go back to 2009, the loan book was GBP 2.4 billion, that's more than doubled in that period to GBP 4.9 billion, so we just need to make sure we've got greater IT capability and greater IT scalability. But also, a constant attention to upgrading the quality, the robustness and scalability of our IT. Just to give you an idea of some of the things that we've done and are currently doing, we have 12 separate data centers across the whole of the bank about 3 years ago, we've now migrated that into 2 states-of-the-art data centers. We've upgraded a completely new general ledger across the bank. We have previously 33 general ledgers, that's down to 1 now. We put in place, from scratch, a credit management information system, which enabled us to have central, a quantitative and qualitative oversight over lending decisions being made at all the local branches. And importantly, we're upgrading legacy systems in the property part of the business, and improving the finance part of the business. What are we doing currently now and going forward? Cyber security and general information security is another area of spend that we're involved in. And importantly and critically, we're taking considerable steps at the moment to have more technology at the point-of-sale within the bank. And a very good example is sort of the e-click in motor, where effectively now we're getting to a lending decision, which is almost paperless. And that sort of ties in with the way that the industry is going, it's great flexibility to the way which we dispense with our services. But also importantly, it illustrates greater sort of accuracy in the information, because it's being actually input at the point-of-sale, rather than subsequently off some sort of hard copy documentation. So to get to the sort of the question, can we see any significant change coming forward in that mix in the bank? Probably not. I'll point to the sort of the 10-year average of the cost income ratio of 49%; first half, we're about 48%, so we're in that type of range, 49% to 48% for the cost income ratio, and it reflects the nature of the business model that we have.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nI think the point that we can't emphasize enough is that we need the kind of the investment to support the growth, but we also need the investment to make that safeguard. This is a, clearly, highly regulated period of time, and for us to ensure that we could continue to grow and do that safely, is actually going to continue to be a real competitive advantage, so this is investment well made.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Simpson (Analysts)】\nIt's Gregory Simpson from UBS. Two questions. Firstly, back on Winterflood, when I look at the AIM volumes reported by the LSE, it looks like January and February have been significantly better than at other moments in the year. I mean, do you see that the short-term volumes of that transcribe through to Winterflood, or is it a slower process? And then secondly, on competition, you said it's coming back, but do you think it's starting to intensify now? I know Paragon announced they're opening a bank for car finance or [indiscernible] and focusing more on SME lending. And the tough markets, which you said, where competition are -- is least present, like property, that's where the strongest loan book growth is being seen. So I mean, are you seeing some activities to intensify, or is it still quite subdued?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nOkay. On the first question, in terms of January and February trading on AIM, and whether or not that's reflected in Winterflood? Winterflood has a strong position on AIM. It's a leading player on AIM. It's good for Winterflood when AIM is seeing lots of volume, but it's a daily trading business. And so what we cannot do is to try and predict trends. All we can do is to point to the leadership position on the one hand, and then as you all know based on what you do, the IPO pipeline for the next period looks quite strong, but that's obviously subject to market conditions. And as I mentioned in my remarks, Winterflood doesn't do the IPOs, but it trades them, and it's good if that product is out there providing interest to investors. So we can only judge as it happens as opposed to looking forward, but they're very well-positioned. On the competition point, in the bank, overarchingly, we see that as patchy. So there are places where there is more than there was, motor is an example of that, the clearers are clearing more present in the motor business. There are a bit more present in large ticket property, but that tends to be larger than where we play. The likes of Lombard are more present in asset finance. But again, that tends to be in the slightly large ticket areas. And the startup banks are all looking to do what they can do in places like asset and invoice financing. And there, I think the issue is distribution, where we've obviously been at this for a very long time. We have a lot of people that are focused on distribution in the SME space, and that's clearly a comparative advantage. So it's increasing, but it's still fragmented, and it's still nothing like it was back in the '07 period.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Arnaud Giblat (Analysts)】\nArnaud Giblat from UBS. A couple of questions. Are there any new niche that you're exploring to grow into in the Banking business? And secondly, I'm just wondering if you could comment a bit more about the revenue per -- the profitability, the revenue margins in Asset Management, that has decelerated somewhat, where do you see those going, in time?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nOkay. The -- in terms of new niches in the Banking business, we have always looked to expand into additional niches. And over a long period of time, we've done that. And what we want to do is to preserve the overall model that establishes the risk parameters that we have. We're overwhelmingly in smaller-ticket, shorter-term, secured high-margin lending, but that's not to say that we won't explore the edges and what might be available to us. And that could be high-margin retail, specialist retail lending. It could be more complicated, small project lending in new or alternative energy, for example. Those are 2 examples of where we might kind of look at the distribution curve of our lending. And both of them are interesting to us but they have to fall overall into the context of us sticking kind of fundamentally to the model. So we look at it all the time, basically, and we're constantly kind of challenging ourselves to push out the edges. In terms of the revenue margin in Asset Management, I think a bit of context here. In 2011, that revenue margin was 71 basis points. For the 6 months period 1 year ago, it was 84 basis points, it's 87 basis points now. We'll continue to see it increase over time. It will be partly a function of mix if we take on more managed assets, more high-net-worth assets in any period, then those are slightly lower margin. If we take on more new advice business in any period, that's slightly higher margin. So I think you'll see a gradual increase in the revenue margin, but it will depend on mix. It's an indicator of the performance of the business, not the only driver of the performance of the business. And what we obviously look at is the overall operating margin in the business. And we're looking to get operating leverage out of our investment in the business, and that's tracking very nicely, had a 9% increase in cost, 3% increase -- I'm sorry, 9% increase in income, 3% increase in costs this period, is what is driving that increase in profitability.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Philip Middleton (Analysts)】\nIt's Philip Middleton at Merrill. Just a couple of questions. Firstly, could you talk us through what you see the trajectory of the credit charge? Because it seems to me to be about as good as it gets? And I wonder if you could talk us through that in the context of the cycle we're in. And secondly, capital generation. I mean, your capital numbers are very strong, how do you see that panning out over the next few years? And how do you think about what you might do with that capital?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nOkay. I think in terms of bad debt, and where we are there, we're at 1%. The 10-year average is 1.6%. The peak over a long period of time has been 2.6%, and in any 1 year, this is about as good as it has been. And I think that's right. So what's going on there? We're still see some improvements in property, because we had a legacy book which takes a while to work through, we still saw some improvements in asset finance, retail is about as low as it's going to get. So yes, we're at a long-term historical low point. On the other hand, as we look forward over the next few months, for example, we don't see a sudden spike in that happening anytime soon either.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jonathan Howell (Executives)】\nAnd then on the sort of capital, thanks for that question, your attention to capital is always there, ever present. We are in a position now that, at this level of loan book growth that we've experienced and this level of overall group profitability, we are in an environment where capital will begin to accumulate, and all things being equal, and there are some small adjustments on that around Winterflood risk or Winter's market risk around the smooth CRD IV adjustments. Everything else being equal, we will begin to see the common equity Tier 1 ratio increase. And that contrasts to our results presentation 6 months ago, when I was asked the same question. And I said the patent level of group profitability of GBP 167 million, and that level of group loan book growth of 13%, that, all things being equal, we are about capital neutral. So we've just moved through that inflection point over the last 6 months, and that's quite important. And if we continue on the types of trends that we see, of the types of levels of loan book growth, and the types of level and increase and improvement in group profitability, our core -- our common equity Tier 1 ratio will increase. That is a gradual process, it's a process that will take a number of years. We want to be extremely well capitalized as we have been in the past to make sure that as a bank of our size that our capital integrity is without question. Secondly, we want to have a degree of flexibility to be able to go through very strong periods of organic growth that we just experienced when our Core Tier 1 equity ratio came down from about 15%, down to 12.5%. And lastly, we want to have the flexibility where appropriate, and if appropriate, to do any infill acquisitions in the Asset Management division. So once we've gone through that period of increasing capital and giving ourselves the flexibility to address those 3 things I just identified, at some stage, we will have a question. And clearly, we'll look at that question in a very, very economic way. But that, I hasten to add, is a good period of time off, and that we expect is months or years. Any other question? Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jonathan Howell (Executives)】\nThank you.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Angelina. Good afternoon. Here with me is Brian and Raymond, as Angelina mentioned. As usual, we will briefly run down the results and offer some background information, before answering the questions you submitted earlier today.\r\nBut before we start, we would like to recap this morning's announcement regarding our changes in the executive management team. In September, I will take on the role of Executive Chairman of the company. Our Chief Operating Officer, Brian Hannasch, would be promoted to the role of President and CEO. This transaction will take place at our Annual Shareholders' Meeting on September 24.\r\nWe have an amazing senior leadership team, and Brian is the right person to lead it. Brian has been intimately involved in developing our strategy and improving our business. His strong leadership, his management skills and his deep experience across the entire value chain of our business qualify him to step into this role.\r\nI intend to be a very active Executive Chairman. This new role will allow me to focus mainly on the growth and development of Couche-Tard, to serve us a mentor and coach to Brian and our next generation of leaders and, from time to time, to join Brian and the executive team on market tours. I see this change as an evolution. It will allow me to invest more of my time on acquisitions and new industries' opportunities. I will still be at the office on a daily basis, will take part of the results review every 4 weeks in the budgeting process as well as in strategic discussions. I must confess that I have seen sense of excitement about retail that I had when I founded this organization 34 years ago. I took back -- I look back upon the journey of those years with a tremendous sense of fulfillment and pride, and today, I still love what I do.\r\nBack when we were setting up the business, the best thing we had going for us was our can-do attitude. We continually look for what work better for our customer and for our business. This is the DNA that has been at the art of our growth, and I'm happy to see that it is alive across Couche-Tard today. Our story isn't just one of tremendous growth and expansion, it's one of growth with discipline, growth with profitability and growth with ambitious targets.\r\n[indiscernible] that Brian will now continue this journey, but also take us to new heights. Brian, over to you.\n\n---\n\nAll right. Thank you, Alain, and good afternoon, everyone. It's a great pride that I accept the role of President and CEO of Couche-Tard. I'm both humbled and extremely excited by this challenge, which is also a great opportunity. \r\nI first came to the company in 2001 while with the Bigfoot acquisition of the Midwest, which was Couche-Tard's first step in the U.S. market back then. I've had the good fortune of working closely with Alain and his founding partners from those early days, right through becoming Chief Operating Officer in early 2010.\r\nLike Alain, I've got a very strong belief in the DNA of the company. Our stores are our livelihood, and Couche-Tard is a great shift that I can assure you there will be no sudden changes in direction. Our strategies are proven effective, and we have a very experienced management team that assure they can deliver time and time again. I look forward to building on Alain's legacy and, together with our talented, committed and experienced people, from the shop floor to the boardroom, taking Couche-Tard to even greater heights. Just to make sure we avoid any misinterpretations, the head office will remain in Laval. In fact, I have a residence here and will relocate once my daughter goes to university this coming fall.\r\nSo now let's back to the business to date, Alain.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Brian. We are pleased to present the results of the third quarter of fiscal 2014. Our performance in Europe continues to be in line with the past quarters, with positive same-store sales and volume and for the fourth quarter in a row, partly driven by the contribution from miles as well as by a robust performance from food services.\r\nIn North America, the actions we took during the prior quarters to increase traffic in our stores, our pricing strategies, as well as our focus on the fresh food category are again showing positive results, with an increase in same-store merchandise sales of 3.8% in the United States and 2.2% in Canada. This increase, including the negative effect of the conversion of Canadian operation to the U.S. dollar, is also reflected in the growth of our gross profit in absolute dollars. \r\nOur road transportation fuel margins are again very strong in Europe, which contributed to the solid earnings of the third quarter of fiscal 2014. Concerning the integration of our European network, things are following a steady pace, and we are continuing to benefit from what has been accomplished to-date. We are still on track to materialize the expected synergies as per our plan.\r\nAs for network expansion, during the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we acquired 36 company-operated stores in the United States for a total of 49 stores year-to-date. We also built 14 stores since the beginning of the fiscal year.\r\nFinally, with our always-improving leverage ratios and solid balance sheet, we are more than ever in a good position to materialize potential opportunities. As always, we cannot say much about it considering the confidential nature of the subject. But we are actively looking at opportunities of different sizes. Our ongoing work to improve the quality of our network, our nice pipeline of new sites that will materialize in the future, in addition to investments made towards our program, will continue to generate additional value. \r\nNow I will let Raymond to go over our numbers in more details. Raymond?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Alain, and congratulations to my future new boss, Brian. And of course, thank you to Alain to -- because he took the decision to stay focused within the company, stay involved in the company and focus on the growth of this company going forward. I think, we are just, again, continuing the nice evolution that we did over the years.\r\nGood afternoon, everyone. Let's talk a little bit more about the numbers. And the net earnings posted at $182.3 million for the third quarter, an increase of $40.1 million or 28.2%, while diluted earnings per share stood at $0.96 per share. Some items affected the results of the third quarter of fiscal 2014. Once adjusted for these items, adjusted net earnings stood at $175 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2014, an increase of 14.4%, while adjusted diluted earnings per share stood at approximately $0.92, an increase of 13.6%. Please remember that our earnings for SFR for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 include 110 days compared to 123 days for the third quarter of fiscal 2013.\r\nThe growth is in net earnings derived partially from the nice results in same-store merchandise sales and fuel volumes. The strong road transportation fuel margin interrupt as well as the contributions from our acquisition also played an important part in the increase in earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. Again, the contribution from our organic growth, including the impact of our continuous focus on the food, as well as the contribution from our acquisition, are the usual components of our long-established recipe. These items, which contributed to the growth in net earnings, were partially offset by the negative net impact of the conversion of our sales and expenses from our Canadian and European operations, in U.S. dollars, as well as by lower revenues, following the divestiture of our LPG business in December 2012. These results are solid when taking into account the unfavorable weather, which affected many of our North American markets, and the state of the economy in general. \r\nNow let's take a look on our key figures. Our organic growth is reflected in our same-store merchandise sales, which increased by 2.8% (sic) [3.8%] in the United States, by 8.9% in Europe and by 2.2% in Canada. More specifically, in North America, this growth is noteworthy, considering the unfavorable weather, which affected many of our markets, as previously stated. This increase in all our markets is the result of the pricing strategies we adopted during the previous quarter, aimed at increasing traffic in our stores as well as through the continuous efforts we've put in the fresh food category. This helped us keep our momentum in terms of transaction count. In Europe, this is the fourth quarter in a row that same-store sales are showing positive results.\r\nThe merchandise and service gross margin for the third quarter was mainly impacted by our pricing strategy and stood at 32.7% in the United States and at 32.7% in Canada. Gross margin for merchandise and service in Europe posted at 43.2%. Excluding the negative impact from the translation of our European and Canadian operations into U.S. dollars, growth in dollars of the merchandise and service gross margin is positive, even though partially offset by the impact of the lower number of days of SFR results for the third quarter of fiscal 2014.\r\nSame-store volume increased by 1.3% in the United States, by 2.7% in Europe and by 2.1% in Canada. This quarter growth in Europe also confirm the positive trend shown during the last 4 quarters. Our fuel brand, miles, is, of course, a good contributor to our results, and help us to take some market share, where the rollout is completed. \r\nDuring the quarter, motor fuel gross margin in the U.S. posted at $0.1702 per gallon, at $0.1144 per liter in Europe and $0.0587 per liter in Canada. As usual, we continue our good work at controlling expenses.\r\nThird quarter EBITDA increased by 7.5% compared to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year, reaching $425.1 million. Net of acquisition costs, acquisition contribute $9 million to EBITDA, while the variation in exchange rates had a negative impact of approximately $5 million. Excluding the curtailment gain on pension plans, obligation of the third quarter of fiscal 2014 as well as the negative goodwill for both comparable periods, the third quarter of fiscal 2014 adjusted EBITDA increased by $22.4 million, or 5.7%, compared to the corresponding period on the previous fiscal year, reaching $417.6 million.\r\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2014, depreciation, amortization and impairment expenses increased by $3.4 million, mainly due to an impairment charge on a non-operational lubricant plant in Poland, partially offset by the fact that the third quarter of fiscal 2014 only includes 110 days of SFR results compared with 123 days for the third quarter of fiscal 2013. We have completed our analysis of the remaining useful life and depreciation periods of the SFR assets, and final results are not significantly different from the preliminary estimates already reflected in the previous quarter.\r\nExcluding the net foreign exchange gain of $10.4 million and the net foreign exchange loss of $13.6 million recorded, respectively, in the third quarters of fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, the decrease in net financial expenses is $3.6 million, explained by the reduction in our long-term debt following repayments we made on our revolving and acquisition facilities.\r\nThe income tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 was 16.1%, compared to 13% for the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal year. Income tax rate is still impacted by the negative goodwill recorded in the first quarter in the United States, where we have our highest statutory tax rate. Without it, our tax rate would only have been slightly higher compared with last year for the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2014.\r\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2014, adjusted net earnings were $175 million, an increase of 14.4%, while adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.92, an increase of 13.6%.\r\nDuring the third quarter, we repaid an additional amount of $265 million on our credit facilities. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, a total of $720 million has been repaid on our facility, from cash generated from our operations.\r\nAs at February 2, 2014, our adjusted net interest-bearing debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.51%, shows rapid improvement compared with the same ratio of 3.05% as at April 28, 2013, and 3.58% shortly after the acquisition of the Statoil Fuel & Retail in June 2012, giving us more flexible to take advantage of investment opportunity that may arise. Our return on capital employed also improved from 12.1% shortly after the acquisition to 13.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. \r\nAnd that concludes my part. Alain?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Raymond. I will start my closing comments in correcting the number I said about the new stores opened since the beginning of the fiscal year. It's since the -- it's in the last quarter, 14 stores were built in the last quarter. And it's less than normal while we have strict CapEx this year because of the debt reimbursement we did focus on.\r\nI'm satisfied with the results of the third quarter. The outcome of our continuous effort to improve our in-store over to our clients and to generate traffic that can result in increased sales and gross profit can be measured by organic growth in North America and Europe. Our various exciting projects with SFR are moving forward, and new opportunities are still being identified. That will keep the teams busy for some time, and will generate long-lasting value for Couche-Tard.\r\nWe will now answer questions you submitted earlier today.",

This increase, including the negative effect of the conversion of Canadian operation to the U.S. dollar, is also reflected in the growth of our gross profit in absolute dollars. \r\nOur road transportation fuel margins are again very strong in Europe, which contributed to the solid earnings of the third quarter of fiscal 2014. Concerning the integration of our European network, things are following a steady pace, and we are continuing to benefit from what has been accomplished to-date. We are still on track to materialize the expected synergies as per our plan.\r\nAs for network expansion, during the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we acquired 36 company-operated stores in the United States for a total of 49 stores year-to-date. We also built 14 stores since the beginning of the fiscal year.\r\nFinally, with our always-improving leverage ratios and solid balance sheet, we are more than ever in a good position to materialize potential opportunities. As always, we cannot say much about it considering the confidential nature of the subject. But we are actively looking at opportunities of different sizes. Our ongoing work to improve the quality of our network, our nice pipeline of new sites that will materialize in the future, in addition to investments made towards our program, will continue to generate additional value. \r\nNow I will let Raymond to go over our numbers in more details. Raymond?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nThank you, Alain, and congratulations to my future new boss, Brian. And of course, thank you to Alain to -- because he took the decision to stay focused within the company, stay involved in the company and focus on the growth of this company going forward. I think, we are just, again, continuing the nice evolution that we did over the years.\r\nGood afternoon, everyone. Let's talk a little bit more about the numbers. And the net earnings posted at $182.3 million for the third quarter, an increase of $40.1 million or 28.2%, while diluted earnings per share stood at $0.96 per share. Some items affected the results of the third quarter of fiscal 2014. Once adjusted for these items, adjusted net earnings stood at $175 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2014, an increase of 14.4%, while adjusted diluted earnings per share stood at approximately $0.92, an increase of 13.6%. Please remember that our earnings for SFR for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 include 110 days compared to 123 days for the third quarter of fiscal 2013.\r\nThe growth is in net earnings derived partially from the nice results in same-store merchandise sales and fuel volumes. The strong road transportation fuel margin interrupt as well as the contributions from our acquisition also played an important part in the increase in earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. Again, the contribution from our organic growth, including the impact of our continuous focus on the food, as well as the contribution from our acquisition, are the usual components of our long-established recipe. These items, which contributed to the growth in net earnings, were partially offset by the negative net impact of the conversion of our sales and expenses from our Canadian and European operations, in U.S. dollars, as well as by lower revenues, following the divestiture of our LPG business in December 2012. These results are solid when taking into account the unfavorable weather, which affected many of our North American markets, and the state of the economy in general. \r\nNow let's take a look on our key figures. Our organic growth is reflected in our same-store merchandise sales, which increased by 2.8% (sic) [3.8%] in the United States, by 8.9% in Europe and by 2.2% in Canada. More specifically, in North America, this growth is noteworthy, considering the unfavorable weather, which affected many of our markets, as previously stated. This increase in all our markets is the result of the pricing strategies we adopted during the previous quarter, aimed at increasing traffic in our stores as well as through the continuous efforts we've put in the fresh food category. This helped us keep our momentum in terms of transaction count. In Europe, this is the fourth quarter in a row that same-store sales are showing positive results.\r\nThe merchandise and service gross margin for the third quarter was mainly impacted by our pricing strategy and stood at 32.7% in the United States and at 32.7% in Canada. Gross margin for merchandise and service in Europe posted at 43.2%. Excluding the negative impact from the translation of our European and Canadian operations into U.S. dollars, growth in dollars of the merchandise and service gross margin is positive, even though partially offset by the impact of the lower number of days of SFR results for the third quarter of fiscal 2014.\r\nSame-store volume increased by 1.3% in the United States, by 2.7% in Europe and by 2.1% in Canada. This quarter growth in Europe also confirm the positive trend shown during the last 4 quarters. Our fuel brand, miles, is, of course, a good contributor to our results, and help us to take some market share, where the rollout is completed. \r\nDuring the quarter, motor fuel gross margin in the U.S. posted at $0.1702 per gallon, at $0.1144 per liter in Europe and $0.0587 per liter in Canada. As usual, we continue our good work at controlling expenses.\r\nThird quarter EBITDA increased by 7.5% compared to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year, reaching $425.1 million. Net of acquisition costs, acquisition contribute $9 million to EBITDA, while the variation in exchange rates had a negative impact of approximately $5 million. Excluding the curtailment gain on pension plans, obligation of the third quarter of fiscal 2014 as well as the negative goodwill for both comparable periods, the third quarter of fiscal 2014 adjusted EBITDA increased by $22.4 million, or 5.7%, compared to the corresponding period on the previous fiscal year, reaching $417.6 million.\r\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2014, depreciation, amortization and impairment expenses increased by $3.4 million, mainly due to an impairment charge on a non-operational lubricant plant in Poland, partially offset by the fact that the third quarter of fiscal 2014 only includes 110 days of SFR results compared with 123 days for the third quarter of fiscal 2013. We have completed our analysis of the remaining useful life and depreciation periods of the SFR assets, and final results are not significantly different from the preliminary estimates already reflected in the previous quarter.\r\nExcluding the net foreign exchange gain of $10.4 million and the net foreign exchange loss of $13.6 million recorded, respectively, in the third quarters of fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, the decrease in net financial expenses is $3.6 million, explained by the reduction in our long-term debt following repayments we made on our revolving and acquisition facilities.\r\nThe income tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 was 16.1%, compared to 13% for the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal year. Income tax rate is still impacted by the negative goodwill recorded in the first quarter in the United States, where we have our highest statutory tax rate. Without it, our tax rate would only have been slightly higher compared with last year for the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2014.\r\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2014, adjusted net earnings were $175 million, an increase of 14.4%, while adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.92, an increase of 13.6%.\r\nDuring the third quarter, we repaid an additional amount of $265 million on our credit facilities. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, a total of $720 million has been repaid on our facility, from cash generated from our operations.\r\nAs at February 2, 2014, our adjusted net interest-bearing debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.51%, shows rapid improvement compared with the same ratio of 3.05% as at April 28, 2013, and 3.58% shortly after the acquisition of the Statoil Fuel & Retail in June 2012, giving us more flexible to take advantage of investment opportunity that may arise. Our return on capital employed also improved from 12.1% shortly after the acquisition to 13.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. \r\nAnd that concludes my part. Alain?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Alain Bouchard (Executives)】\nThank you, Raymond. I will start my closing comments in correcting the number I said about the new stores opened since the beginning of the fiscal year. It's since the -- it's in the last quarter, 14 stores were built in the last quarter. And it's less than normal while we have strict CapEx this year because of the debt reimbursement we did focus on.\r\nI'm satisfied with the results of the third quarter. The outcome of our continuous effort to improve our in-store over to our clients and to generate traffic that can result in increased sales and gross profit can be measured by organic growth in North America and Europe. Our various exciting projects with SFR are moving forward, and new opportunities are still being identified. That will keep the teams busy for some time, and will generate long-lasting value for Couche-Tard.\r\nWe will now answer questions you submitted earlier today.",
      "transcript_text3": "You have noted that North American customers are so very value-focused, and this seems you're working to provide the right balance in sales and margins and employee-specific tactics to drive baskets. Has this backdrop remained same throughout the third quarter relative to the first half of your fiscal year? And generally, which of your tactics are proving most effective?\n\n---\n\nThis is Brian. I'll take that one. I'd say the pressures on the customer is still there as we see -- looking at post-releases from not only our channel, but other retailers. In terms of our tactics, a lot of different ones across our various business units, but I'll lump them into 3 big buckets. In terms of increasing the basket, our focus in more combos, bundling chips and drinks, things like that, 2 floors. Our layouts, improving our adjacencies, using data we have from our scan to use more science from what items to put where in the store, which I would say has been our most successful to-date, and a lot of work done in that regard. And then the third would be suggested selling, which I would still characterize as a work in process and, probably, the most potential. If we can get our 80,000 people engaged every day consistently in selling more, that's our biggest opportunity.\n\n---\n\nIn addition to your ongoing acquisition of sites, you also have a new store program that is reasonably active. Can you talk about how stores of 2014, the new openings, might differ? If they do, from stores you opened, say, 5 years ago in terms of features, configuration, and et cetera, is there any influence from your SFR experience that figures into the new store thinking in North America?\n\n---\n\nI'll take that one. As I said, we have slowed down the new to industry stores for the last fiscal, or this actual fiscal, for focusing on debt reimbursement. So we will have quite a big number of stores that are ready to go for next fiscal. What we do as a difference in size today, we were building 2,400 square feet stores up to 5 years ago. Then 5 years ago, we started to use the 3,200 square feet minimum as a box; and now, we're building more in the range of 3,600 square foot. So we go up to 4,500 square foot. So these are the full math we are using today. So bigger stores with more food service offering, better aligned between the divisions. So we are going with 2 different formats instead of 5 or 6 before. And we are testing a lot of different offers we have in Europe in different division. So we will see how it goes and, eventually, pick the right product for the right division. So this is ongoing. Brian will talk about more food service later in this discussion. About the other offer, about other than the food service, you would see more doors, more cooler doors in our stores. We were 10 doors. Now it's more, 15 to 20 doors. And we have a lot more other beverages that include, energy drink and water, and all sort of different waters - the vitamin waters and all different waters today, so - and it's growing quite fast. So yes, a big, big configuration difference today as opposed to 5 years ago.\n\n---\n\nLet me add outside the box. We've become more disciplined around parking spaces, distance between the pumps and the store, distance between the pumps and the road. We have found -- and QuikTrip and people like that have shown us the customer value, freedom of movement and ease of movement on our sites. So I think you'll see -- and you do see more of that discipline in our new developments.\n\n---\n\nCan you provide an update on your food service and fresh food initiatives? What percentage of in-store growth margin does fresh food and food service represents?\n\n---\n\nYes, I will take this one. It's Raymond Paré. The food is still a catalyst and a big focus for us. Over a 17% of our total margin come from this category. We are experiencing solid same-store sales growth. And as a you just heard, it's clear that in our new stores and in our existing stores, it's clearly a category that we're pushing and making, I will say, more and more important.\n\n---\n\nWhat would be an appropriate tax rate to use for fiscal year 2015?\n\n---\n\nAs you know, we don't have -- we don't give any kind of forecast. Of course, the trend could slightly be down. I will say, be up, the rate, with the deleveraging, but it's only if you are taking this factor in consideration. Again, not given factor or, I will say, forecast. But for sure, as we said in the past, the de-leveraging element will have an impact to push the rate slightly up, but it's not the only factor that could influence the tax rate.\n\n---\n\nWith regards to the change in management, can you talk about how you see Alain's role and Brian's role complementing one another and evolving over time, and why now?\n\n---\n\nWe'll start with the why now. It's a personal timing for Brian and I; and timing, good timing for the board too. We have had undertaking discussions for the last couple of years. And it also goes with the size we are today. With the Europe, with the Asia and North America, we thought it was a good timing for me to evolve in the role of more focused on acquisition and M&A activities, single sites -- NPI and the single sites acquisition and small buckets of store acquisition. And Brian is ready. I mean, he has been with the company a number of years, and he is well-known by the organization, well respected. So that's the right thing to do and now is the right time. So Brian -- maybe, Brian, you can comment on what would be your role and...\n\n---\n\nEverything else, everything Alain doesn't want to do.\n\n---\n\nNo, no. I like everything I do. I will participate in some of the store visit, market visit, but less. It's very demanding. So Brian will focus on everything else.\n\n---\n\nCan you please provide an update on the fresh food initiative? How satisfied are you with the ongoing progress, growth rate of fresh food versus the balance of the inside categories, the proportion of inside sales from fresh food and any near-term initiatives?\n\n---\n\nSo assuming this question focuses on North America, we've launched 4 markets, and in the process of our fifth, what we call as our fresh pilots. And this is -- this would entail, typically, 6-times-per-week delivery, the primary categories or foundation being fresh meat, pastries and sandwiches every day, and then also provide the foundation of delivery from a lot of other SKUs, such as salads, parfaits, fruit. The results have been very good. We've seen unit increases in the 60% to 100% range in these pilot markets. It shows customers new value, quality and fresh. Our challenge is to continue to do it in a disciplined fashion and provide our operators with the tools to execute it well. But, I would say, somewhat early on, we are very, very encouraged by the initiative.\n\n---\n\nYour SG&A were down 3.4% year-over-year when you exclude acquisitions, currency and certain other items. Could you quantify the impact on SG&A from the shorter reporting period in Europe?\n\n---\n\nI will say, we are not giving any specific by market. But as we discussed, it's made globally to improve our efficiency through benchmarking on a common basis. Then other than that, the rest of the figure in terms of number of days were given in the MD&A, I will refer to the MD&A in terms of numbers.\n\n---\n\nCan you discuss variation in basket size in traffic in all 3 mains regions, Canada, U.S. and Europe, during the quarter?\n\n---\n\nWe're not going to give specifics by region. I would say that overall growth in basket and traffic continue to improve. And I would add even Europe more so, as traffic outpaces sales growth, as we work on our price perception in key categories in the convenience channel in Europe.\n\n---\n\nThis is a question for Brian Hannasch. You mentioned this morning that you were deeply involved in the process of acquiring Statoil. Now that you've been involved with the business for a period of time, can you indicate an area that has surprised you positively or negatively? What is expectation from your due diligence process?\n\n---\n\nIt's a good question. I would say this. If you put the acquisition in context, there were several quarters of negative merchandise sales in Statoil prior to acquisition. And fuel volumes was pretty much following industry trend in Europe, which is, let's call it minus 1. And 18 months later, we're experiencing positive merchandise sales and a very positive fuel volumes, road transportation volumes on a same-store basis. So as I'm impressed with the management team's adoption of some of the North American best practices in their stores and then certainly the impact that miles, our fuel brand launch has had in the countries that it's been launched so far. So, I think, those would be the highlights.\n\n---\n\nCan you clarify the tax rates for the quarter before nonrecurring items? And update us on the tax rate going forward?\n\n---\n\nIn the tax rate, the explanation is; if you remove -- before the nonrecurring items, we were talking about rate around 15.2%. But -- and for the year-to-date, I'll see the -- or for the next quarter, the year-to-date should be a good indication. And as I previously mentioned, for next year, we're not giving the forecast. But you can figure, or you can put some factor based on deleveraging, that could be compensated by other factors.\n\n---\n\nCan you discuss how you feel the integration of SFR is going relative to your original timeline expectations for best practices, procurement savings, overhead reductions and et cetera? Also, can you explain why synergies for the 16 weeks of Q3 were $13 million, while the total realized annual synergies rise $64 million. Is the $13 million dollar figure net of costs and $64 million figure a run rate without offsetting costs?\n\n---\n\nJust to clarify, the $64 million in synergies represents actual realized to-date since the acquisition, while $13 million represents additional synergies realized this quarter. That's in the context of this year being the, really, the key part of the ERP rollout. So there were, certainly, higher expenses triggered by rolling that system out. Now as we finish that ERP rollout, we just pull in remaining -- there is lot of activity to execute a very detailed plan in the coming fiscal year, and we remain very confident at our targets.\n\n---\n\nCould you provide us the reviews on the health of consumer by major geography, U.S., Europe and Canada? And to what degree Couche-Tard's same-store sales growth is a function of improving consumer trends that are lifting the entire industry versus market share gains related the company-specific performance at Couche-Tard?\n\n---\n\nThis is Brian. I'll take that. You all see the results of our competitors and other retail channels. We feel that we're performing very well in the context of what we still consider to be a very challenged retail environment.\n\n---\n\nWalmart has opened a group of Walmart Express stores in North Carolina. This new format have more or less impact on a nearby Circle K than the opening of a competitive, traditional convenience fuel store, or a larger-format convenience store such as QuikTrip.\n\n---\n\nI would say, to-date our experience with the Walmart Express format, in particular is somewhat limited, so I won't speculate. And my hypothesis is, it will have less impact than a traditional competitor like a QuikTrip as it's still a somewhat different shopping occasion.\n\n---\n\nHas Circle K stores in trade areas where Dollar General and Family Dollar are now selling tobacco products and the negative impact on store traffic and/or traffic volumes?\n\n---\n\nFew were outperforming. Our data showing we are outperforming the overall market in tobacco volume. That being said, there certainly have to be some impact. The pie is only so big for tobacco volume, and that pie is shrinking at some rate. So certainly, they've taken some share. But our volumes have remained very stable and, again, outperformed overall industry. So we're happy with our progress.\n\n---\n\nIn the press release, Mr. Bouchard said, \"The new role will let me invest more of my time in acquisitions and new industry opportunities.\" What do you mean by new industry opportunities? Does that include business opportunities where Couche-Tard does not currently participate?\n\n---\n\nOh, sorry for the confusion. No, it means the new -- within the convenience store industry. So we are not looking to go in the other type of industry.\n\n---\n\nWhat level of ownership does Couche-Tard have in the fuel distribution assets. Example trucks, tankers, depots, storage terminals, et cetera? Is there consideration being given to an alternative capital structure for these assets?\n\n---\n\nIt's Ray. I will take this one. I am pretty sure the question is more related to the U.S. with the concept of MLP that we see basically existing in the U.S. Then if I go back to the first portion of the question, what we have as a truck, tanker, depot, storage terminals is pretty small in the U.S. And as previously mentioned in other calls, like, this kind of concept of MLP, we don't have the intention or the plans to put an MLP in place for this small portion of our business. And also, not necessarily, basically, as -- like, we already have, being international operators, some advantage that perhaps some local or some U.S. operators don't have, and they're getting some advantage by using MLP. But we are not in the same situation. For now, as I mentioned in the past, we're not having as a plan to put an MLP in place.\n\n---\n\nThe press release mentioned that Alain Bouchard will spend more time looking at the industry opportunities. Can you please elaborate on what those opportunities could be?\n\n---\n\nWell, that means for us a more grassroot work on big opportunities or markets, whereas we do not have resources on the ground. Example of that is; when I travel in Europe or other continent, I go for 3, 4 days and I come back here, and I am busy at other stuff. Now, with my new role, I would be able to spend 3 weeks, a month in this market, if I want to, if I see the opportunity to. So I will meet with industry people, companies that have convenience stores that are not maybe their focus or stuff like that. So I would be better positioned to look at these while I've been in the industry forever actually.\n\n---\n\nDo you expect CapEx in fiscal 2015 to be roughly in line with 2014?\n\n---\n\nWe are starting our review of the budget, and this specific quarter, I will say, final numbers are not available. But, I will say, on the net of our disposal -- I will say, an acquisition, we should be pretty much in line with what we have previously in the last 2 to 3 years. But we'll have a different kind of mix in the CapEx budget. Like, we should have less money related to some IT. As Brian mentioned earlier, we are finishing the implementation of our system and Europe, and we should increase the level of new-to-industry stores that we'll build this year. We have a great pipeline to [indiscernible] in recent years, and that will part to be materialized going forward in the next year.\n\n---\n\nCould you explain the thinking behind the 3-for-1 split?\n\n---\n\nThat's a good question. It's not a scientific analysis, not economic-driven, as you certainly know. It's been on the table for a couple of years now. Each annual meeting, or the people I meet in the market that are shareholders are retail shareholders, and we have a good group of retail shareholders. And they have been with us for a number of years and they saw us split, 3, 4 times already, and they had a good rise. And they ask why we're not splitting. So it's easy to explain. There is no need to do that, no use to do it. It's same impact. But still, they are demanding. So I've proposed to the board do that. And 3-for-1, because if -- it's an answer to these guys that a lower price share could attract them and invite them to invest more in our stock. So that's not a great rational, but that's the reason why we're doing this.\n\n---\n\nGiven the improvement in leverage, but lack of large-scale acquisitions in sight, as noted on the last conference call, you anticipate incremental returns to shareholders; example, reinstituting a needful [ph] share buyback program?\n\n---\n\nIt's Ray. I will take this one. As mentioned, we are active on the acquisition side for different size of opportunities. As we mentioned, we could not give any specific, as you can imagine, because of the confidentiality related to it. Then that didn't change cycle for the recent quarter or last quarters. We were always kind of busy in adding some opportunities in the pipeline. Then it's still the, basically, the same and we are continuing to work on that side. That being said, we are still and will generate value organically, with the remaining synergies that we have with SFR, with the food that will continue to be a catalyst in North America, and even in Europe because we're still producing there too, and our operation in general. We don't see, for now, in the near future, the necessity to put or to think about the buyback program as you did propose in the question.\n\n---\n\nWhat is your outlook for gas prices and gas margins in the U.S. markets? Do you believe that rising retail fuel prices have any material impact on volume or margins over the summer?\n\n---\n\nWe don't see any developments that would affect margins over a longer period of time. And we don't and really can't speculate on prices or margins or crude levels in the short term.\n\n---\n\nThere are movements by certain state governments to ban or restrict the sale of tobacco in drugstores, supermarkets and mass merchants. On the other hand, there is a movement to link tobacco consumption to rising healthcare premiums. Do you see these various changes affecting the convenience store tobacco business over the next 12 months?\n\n---\n\n12 months is not a long time. If you think about -- if everybody responded to the Attorney General's prompting, it may take the greater portion of 12 months or something like that to happen. That being said, drugstores, supermarkets and mass stores have a very material part in tobacco category. I see the convenience channel as being the natural beneficiary if something like that would occur. The other piece being the linking the healthcare premiums, I don't have a clear assumption on how that would affect demand in the near term, but certainly not over the next 12 months.\n\n---\n\nThank you.\n\n---\n\nThank you very much.",

The food is still a catalyst and a big focus for us. Over a 17% of our total margin come from this category. We are experiencing solid same-store sales growth. And as a you just heard, it's clear that in our new stores and in our existing stores, it's clearly a category that we're pushing and making, I will say, more and more important.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Derek Dley (Analysts)】\nWhat would be an appropriate tax rate to use for fiscal year 2015?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nAs you know, we don't have -- we don't give any kind of forecast. Of course, the trend could slightly be down. I will say, be up, the rate, with the deleveraging, but it's only if you are taking this factor in consideration. Again, not given factor or, I will say, forecast. But for sure, as we said in the past, the de-leveraging element will have an impact to push the rate slightly up, but it's not the only factor that could influence the tax rate.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Irene Nattel (Analysts)】\nWith regards to the change in management, can you talk about how you see Alain's role and Brian's role complementing one another and evolving over time, and why now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alain Bouchard (Executives)】\nWe'll start with the why now. It's a personal timing for Brian and I; and timing, good timing for the board too. We have had undertaking discussions for the last couple of years. And it also goes with the size we are today. With the Europe, with the Asia and North America, we thought it was a good timing for me to evolve in the role of more focused on acquisition and M&A activities, single sites -- NPI and the single sites acquisition and small buckets of store acquisition. And Brian is ready. I mean, he has been with the company a number of years, and he is well-known by the organization, well respected. So that's the right thing to do and now is the right time. So Brian -- maybe, Brian, you can comment on what would be your role and...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nEverything else, everything Alain doesn't want to do.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alain Bouchard (Executives)】\nNo, no. I like everything I do. I will participate in some of the store visit, market visit, but less. It's very demanding. So Brian will focus on everything else.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Irene Nattel (Analysts)】\nCan you please provide an update on the fresh food initiative? How satisfied are you with the ongoing progress, growth rate of fresh food versus the balance of the inside categories, the proportion of inside sales from fresh food and any near-term initiatives?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nSo assuming this question focuses on North America, we've launched 4 markets, and in the process of our fifth, what we call as our fresh pilots. And this is -- this would entail, typically, 6-times-per-week delivery, the primary categories or foundation being fresh meat, pastries and sandwiches every day, and then also provide the foundation of delivery from a lot of other SKUs, such as salads, parfaits, fruit. The results have been very good. We've seen unit increases in the 60% to 100% range in these pilot markets. It shows customers new value, quality and fresh. Our challenge is to continue to do it in a disciplined fashion and provide our operators with the tools to execute it well. But, I would say, somewhat early on, we are very, very encouraged by the initiative.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Martin Landry (Analysts)】\nYour SG&A were down 3.4% year-over-year when you exclude acquisitions, currency and certain other items. Could you quantify the impact on SG&A from the shorter reporting period in Europe?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nI will say, we are not giving any specific by market. But as we discussed, it's made globally to improve our efficiency through benchmarking on a common basis. Then other than that, the rest of the figure in terms of number of days were given in the MD&A, I will refer to the MD&A in terms of numbers.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Martin Landry (Analysts)】\nCan you discuss variation in basket size in traffic in all 3 mains regions, Canada, U.S. and Europe, during the quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nWe're not going to give specifics by region. I would say that overall growth in basket and traffic continue to improve. And I would add even Europe more so, as traffic outpaces sales growth, as we work on our price perception in key categories in the convenience channel in Europe.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Sklar (Analysts)】\nThis is a question for Brian Hannasch. You mentioned this morning that you were deeply involved in the process of acquiring Statoil. Now that you've been involved with the business for a period of time, can you indicate an area that has surprised you positively or negatively? What is expectation from your due diligence process?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nIt's a good question. I would say this. If you put the acquisition in context, there were several quarters of negative merchandise sales in Statoil prior to acquisition. And fuel volumes was pretty much following industry trend in Europe, which is, let's call it minus 1. And 18 months later, we're experiencing positive merchandise sales and a very positive fuel volumes, road transportation volumes on a same-store basis. So as I'm impressed with the management team's adoption of some of the North American best practices in their stores and then certainly the impact that miles, our fuel brand launch has had in the countries that it's been launched so far. So, I think, those would be the highlights.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Sklar (Analysts)】\nCan you clarify the tax rates for the quarter before nonrecurring items? And update us on the tax rate going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nIn the tax rate, the explanation is; if you remove -- before the nonrecurring items, we were talking about rate around 15.2%. But -- and for the year-to-date, I'll see the -- or for the next quarter, the year-to-date should be a good indication. And as I previously mentioned, for next year, we're not giving the forecast. But you can figure, or you can put some factor based on deleveraging, that could be compensated by other factors.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Van Aelst (Analysts)】\nCan you discuss how you feel the integration of SFR is going relative to your original timeline expectations for best practices, procurement savings, overhead reductions and et cetera? Also, can you explain why synergies for the 16 weeks of Q3 were $13 million, while the total realized annual synergies rise $64 million. Is the $13 million dollar figure net of costs and $64 million figure a run rate without offsetting costs?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nJust to clarify, the $64 million in synergies represents actual realized to-date since the acquisition, while $13 million represents additional synergies realized this quarter. That's in the context of this year being the, really, the key part of the ERP rollout. So there were, certainly, higher expenses triggered by rolling that system out. Now as we finish that ERP rollout, we just pull in remaining -- there is lot of activity to execute a very detailed plan in the coming fiscal year, and we remain very confident at our targets.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Van Aelst (Analysts)】\nCould you provide us the reviews on the health of consumer by major geography, U.S., Europe and Canada? And to what degree Couche-Tard's same-store sales growth is a function of improving consumer trends that are lifting the entire industry versus market share gains related the company-specific performance at Couche-Tard?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nThis is Brian. I'll take that. You all see the results of our competitors and other retail channels. We feel that we're performing very well in the context of what we still consider to be a very challenged retail environment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nWalmart has opened a group of Walmart Express stores in North Carolina. This new format have more or less impact on a nearby Circle K than the opening of a competitive, traditional convenience fuel store, or a larger-format convenience store such as QuikTrip.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nI would say, to-date our experience with the Walmart Express format, in particular is somewhat limited, so I won't speculate. And my hypothesis is, it will have less impact than a traditional competitor like a QuikTrip as it's still a somewhat different shopping occasion.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nHas Circle K stores in trade areas where Dollar General and Family Dollar are now selling tobacco products and the negative impact on store traffic and/or traffic volumes?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nFew were outperforming. Our data showing we are outperforming the overall market in tobacco volume. That being said, there certainly have to be some impact. The pie is only so big for tobacco volume, and that pie is shrinking at some rate. So certainly, they've taken some share. But our volumes have remained very stable and, again, outperformed overall industry. So we're happy with our progress.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nIn the press release, Mr. Bouchard said, \"The new role will let me invest more of my time in acquisitions and new industry opportunities.\" What do you mean by new industry opportunities? Does that include business opportunities where Couche-Tard does not currently participate?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alain Bouchard (Executives)】\nOh, sorry for the confusion. No, it means the new -- within the convenience store industry. So we are not looking to go in the other type of industry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nWhat level of ownership does Couche-Tard have in the fuel distribution assets. Example trucks, tankers, depots, storage terminals, et cetera? Is there consideration being given to an alternative capital structure for these assets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nIt's Ray. I will take this one. I am pretty sure the question is more related to the U.S. with the concept of MLP that we see basically existing in the U.S. Then if I go back to the first portion of the question, what we have as a truck, tanker, depot, storage terminals is pretty small in the U.S. And as previously mentioned in other calls, like, this kind of concept of MLP, we don't have the intention or the plans to put an MLP in place for this small portion of our business. And also, not necessarily, basically, as -- like, we already have, being international operators, some advantage that perhaps some local or some U.S. operators don't have, and they're getting some advantage by using MLP. But we are not in the same situation. For now, as I mentioned in the past, we're not having as a plan to put an MLP in place.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Li (Analysts)】\nThe press release mentioned that Alain Bouchard will spend more time looking at the industry opportunities. Can you please elaborate on what those opportunities could be?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alain Bouchard (Executives)】\nWell, that means for us a more grassroot work on big opportunities or markets, whereas we do not have resources on the ground. Example of that is; when I travel in Europe or other continent, I go for 3, 4 days and I come back here, and I am busy at other stuff. Now, with my new role, I would be able to spend 3 weeks, a month in this market, if I want to, if I see the opportunity to. So I will meet with industry people, companies that have convenience stores that are not maybe their focus or stuff like that. So I would be better positioned to look at these while I've been in the industry forever actually.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Li (Analysts)】\nDo you expect CapEx in fiscal 2015 to be roughly in line with 2014?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nWe are starting our review of the budget, and this specific quarter, I will say, final numbers are not available. But, I will say, on the net of our disposal -- I will say, an acquisition, we should be pretty much in line with what we have previously in the last 2 to 3 years. But we'll have a different kind of mix in the CapEx budget. Like, we should have less money related to some IT. As Brian mentioned earlier, we are finishing the implementation of our system and Europe, and we should increase the level of new-to-industry stores that we'll build this year. We have a great pipeline to [indiscernible] in recent years, and that will part to be materialized going forward in the next year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nCould you explain the thinking behind the 3-for-1 split?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alain Bouchard (Executives)】\nThat's a good question. It's not a scientific analysis, not economic-driven, as you certainly know. It's been on the table for a couple of years now. Each annual meeting, or the people I meet in the market that are shareholders are retail shareholders, and we have a good group of retail shareholders. And they have been with us for a number of years and they saw us split, 3, 4 times already, and they had a good rise. And they ask why we're not splitting. So it's easy to explain. There is no need to do that, no use to do it. It's same impact. But still, they are demanding. So I've proposed to the board do that. And 3-for-1, because if -- it's an answer to these guys that a lower price share could attract them and invite them to invest more in our stock. So that's not a great rational, but that's the reason why we're doing this.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nGiven the improvement in leverage, but lack of large-scale acquisitions in sight, as noted on the last conference call, you anticipate incremental returns to shareholders; example, reinstituting a needful [ph] share buyback program?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nIt's Ray. I will take this one. As mentioned, we are active on the acquisition side for different size of opportunities. As we mentioned, we could not give any specific, as you can imagine, because of the confidentiality related to it. Then that didn't change cycle for the recent quarter or last quarters. We were always kind of busy in adding some opportunities in the pipeline. Then it's still the, basically, the same and we are continuing to work on that side. That being said, we are still and will generate value organically, with the remaining synergies that we have with SFR, with the food that will continue to be a catalyst in North America, and even in Europe because we're still producing there too, and our operation in general. We don't see, for now, in the near future, the necessity to put or to think about the buyback program as you did propose in the question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nWhat is your outlook for gas prices and gas margins in the U.S. markets? Do you believe that rising retail fuel prices have any material impact on volume or margins over the summer?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nWe don't see any developments that would affect margins over a longer period of time. And we don't and really can't speculate on prices or margins or crude levels in the short term.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nThere are movements by certain state governments to ban or restrict the sale of tobacco in drugstores, supermarkets and mass merchants. On the other hand, there is a movement to link tobacco consumption to rising healthcare premiums. Do you see these various changes affecting the convenience store tobacco business over the next 12 months?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\n12 months is not a long time. If you think about -- if everybody responded to the Attorney General's prompting, it may take the greater portion of 12 months or something like that to happen. That being said, drugstores, supermarkets and mass stores have a very material part in tobacco category. I see the convenience channel as being the natural beneficiary if something like that would occur. The other piece being the linking the healthcare premiums, I don't have a clear assumption on how that would affect demand in the near term, but certainly not over the next 12 months.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alain Bouchard (Executives)】\nThank you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nThank you very much.",

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. \r\nRegarding the second quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with the slides complementing our comments today, is available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.\r\nTo begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another very good quarter. This morning, we reported our 30th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth. That accomplishment is a testament to our organization's focus and discipline around delivering consistent WOW! Customer Service. \r\nLet's spend some time this morning discussing our sales results and provide you some details on regional and product sales trends. We'll also provide some detail on the cadence of sales throughout the 12-week quarter. Next, we will update you on our digital integration initiatives and our international store performance. Finally, we'll highlight what we've been doing to improve our business model for today and beyond. We're very excited about the initiatives we're working on and believe our recent learnings will help to shape our company's future for years to come.\r\nFor the quarter, we reported total sales increase of 7.3%, while same-store sales were up 4.3%. This overall sales performance showed noticeable improvement from our Q1 results. I do want to point out that part of the increase in DIY was due to the calendar shift resulting from our 53rd week in fiscal 2013. Our DIY same-store sales would have been approximately 1% lower if we were comparing to the same weeks last year.\r\nCommercial continued to outpace the growth of our retail business. This quarter, retail showed marked acceleration from recent trends. The colder weather across much of the U.S. drove robust traffic on batteries antifreeze and wiper blades.\r\nHowever, our West Coast stores experienced less favorable weather for parts failures. Abnormally dry conditions led to fewer, for example, wiper blade sales in our stores on the West Coast. We also experienced growth in both traffic and ticket across both our retail and commercial customer segments. Our failure-related hard part categories experienced the highest growth in both retail and commercial.\r\nClearly, the weather was a significant factor, but we also believe that work that we have been doing to improve inventory availability had us very well positioned to capitalize on the increased demand. We feel as we've continued to improve our hard parts product availability, this has led to increasing traffic and ticket, especially in commercial where the vast majority of the business is in hard parts.\r\nIn regard to the cadence of sales trends for the quarter, November, December and through mid-January, our sales ran quite strong, above 5% in same-store sales. However, for the last month of our quarter, our same-store sales slowed. During those weeks, our results dropped into the low single-digit range. We experienced a slowdown across both our retail and commercial businesses.\r\nThe culprit, strange, as it is for me to say, was the weather. It seems I've spent a career talking about how weather, in particular extreme weather, drives positive results for us. But by late January, by the time several of the U.S. regions were experiencing their third or fourth heavy cold snap, the parts that were close to failing appeared to have already failed earlier in the season.\r\nAdditionally, the later storms, particularly across the Southeast, caused us and our commercial customers to close due to the severity of the storms and the poor driving conditions. As we look at the balance of the year, we believe there will be a lingering positive effect on our industry.\r\n2 years ago, the winter was quite mild, and we highlighted that as a headwind for our business for months. Conversely, after the extensive winter we have had this year, we anticipate that demand will remain strong as we head into the spring and summer seasons. While certain failure-related categories were particularly strong during the second quarter, other categories, specifically maintenance categories that can be deferred, were challenged. We expect these deferred projects to be completed in the balance of the year.\r\nRegarding the consumer, we continue to believe our consumer remains under pressure. However, we feel 2014 has several positive items going forward. One large headwind has now been anniversary-ed, the payroll tax reinstatement last year. Another is gas prices have begun to abate, and we believe this can have a positive effect on our customers' ability to spend on routine maintenance.\r\nWith approximately 10 billion of gasoline consumed monthly in the U.S., any sizable move in price can have a material stimulus on the economy. Currently, gasoline prices are approximately $3.35 a gallon, about $0.25 a gallon below this time last year.\r\nAs we are heading into what is forecast to be a more normal spring and summer weather pattern, we are optimistic on the sales front. We continue to assume the most pronounced effects will be felt in the Midwest and Northeast markets, as these have been the most challenged for a couple of years.\r\nRegarding market share, the data we have available to us is showing we're gaining share on both the retail and commercial fronts. We are especially focused on improving our trends in the application parts area where our efforts to improve our assortments would have the most impact.\r\nAnd so far, we are encouraged. We feel the initiatives we're working on are making a difference. For example, we have enhanced our electronic catalog to better serve our customers by further highlighting related items necessary to do the complete job. We believe these enhancements will improve the customer experience and will complement the knowledge of our AutoZoners. While we are early in our efforts, the feedback we're receiving from AutoZoners and customers is encouraging.\r\nRegarding DIY ticket and traffic trends, both increased for the quarter. As I previously mentioned, the traffic count was much stronger earlier in the quarter versus the last few weeks. While we've experienced traffic growth in commercial for several years, it was exciting to see growth in the retail channel.\r\nOn the average ticket front, retail continues to be up but at a lower rate than our historical experience. One driver of the lower retail ticket has been the lack of commodity-based inflation. Currently, we don't see any indications of that trend changing materially in the short to mid-term. While that is good news for our customers, it has certainly challenged our results.\r\nOn the commercial front, we were pleased to see a higher average ticket tied to as noted earlier, more hard parts sales. Overall, we don't have control over the macro factors that impact our business, and that is why we have intensified our efforts on enhancing our offerings. Our efforts on the initiatives we have underway or in test should lead to ongoing sales growth. \r\nWe're pleased with the progress we're making in our commercial business. Our sales increased 12.2% from last year's second quarter, and we opened 49 new programs to finish with 74% of our domestic stores having a commercial sales program. This brings our year-to-date openings to 174. We expect to open a similar number of programs this year as we did last year.\r\nOur all other businesses increased approximately 31% over last year. Starting this quarter, we began to anniversary our acquisition of AutoAnything. The all other segment of our business includes AutoAnything, autozone.com and ALLDATA.\r\nRegarding these businesses, we've introduced the idea of being more digitally integrated. Therefore, we've made this 1 of our 4 strategic growth priorities, along with retail, commercial and international. While in an early stage, we believe this can be an important and significant opportunity for us to deepen customer relationships and ultimately grow sales. \r\nAt this point in the evolution of our online offering, we're focusing more on data compilation and building a knowledge portal than on current sales. Today, shoppers use our websites for educating themselves on what they need for their vehicles, and they continue to buy the vast majority of what they need from our stores, which to us makes perfect sense and is in line with our operating plans. Our objective is to satisfy our customers' needs regardless of how they want to interact with us.\r\nNow I'd like to update you on our initiatives. Last quarter, we discussed that we were testing a handful of initiatives that focused on increasing our ability to say yes to our customers' parts needs in both retail and commercial. We established tests last summer focused on increasing the depth of coverage available at the store, hub stores and at our distribution centers. Product additions at the hub stores and distribution centers also included tests around frequency of delivery to the stores that they service.\r\nOver the last several months, we have significantly increased the pace of strategic assessments and challenged ourselves to review our test results very carefully. The amount of common effort going into this effort has been nothing short of extraordinary. Our entire organization owes the subset of individuals who are leading this effort tremendous gratitude.\r\nOn last quarter's call, we highlighted that one of our test initiatives was complete and in the process of being implemented. This initiative was the enhanced modeling for store SKU placements, where we would significantly add incremental inventory, while simultaneously removing unproductive inventory.\r\nAt the end of the quarter, we were complete with about 75% of this initiative. But it is important to note that much of this additional inventory began arriving at our stores very late in the quarter and some is still in the distribution centers. This has been a massive undertaking and has caused considerable work at the stores and in the distribution centers.\r\nAs you can see, our per store inventories increased significantly as a result of this initiative. We have a high degree of confidence that these new assortments will drive meaningful, profitable sales increases, as we tested this new methodology several times before implementation.\r\nTo date, the sales are generally in line with our expectations. But again, much of the inventory hasn't been positioned for sale or was positioned very late in the quarter.\r\nWe've also been testing additional inventory in our hub stores. We continue to find opportunities to add productive inventory to all of our hubs, and we expect this to continue, especially as we further penetrate the highly fragmented commercial market.\r\nAdditionally, we are testing a much deeper product offering in a select few hub stores, and these locations are leveraging that inventory across a wide network of additional hubs and satellites. This allows us to significantly broaden the depth of the product offering closer to the customer, with many stores having same-day access to the broad assortment.\r\nIn addition to testing broader SKU assortments in our hubs and in our distribution centers, we are also testing more frequent deliveries to both select hub and satellite stores. All of these efforts are designed to assess the most effective way to service our customers' needs and to reduce the amount of unproductive activity we have transferring products from store to store. It is still very early. But what we have learned, as we expected, that more inventory closer to the customer increases sales. At this stage, we have not determined the optimal solution, and we expect to continue to run these tests for an extended period of time.\r\nWe continue to execute on our strategies to improve the customer shopping experience. We expanded 5 net additional hub locations during the quarter to take our total remodeled hubs to 115 locations. These remodels entail expanding the size and capacity of these locations, ensuring they are in the right physical location and adding additional inventory into the market that benefits both retail and commercial.\r\nWe also opened 3 new hub stores, finishing with 160. Over time, we do expect to open more hub locations, but we believe our strategy on inventory deployment at the store level allows us to keep the number of openings at a moderate level.\r\nLast quarter, I also mentioned the new version of Z-net that was being deployed. Over the last couple of years, we have reset our expectations in regard to technology investments in an effort to leverage technology to enhance the customer experience and leverage operating efficiencies. The enhanced Z-net is the first of those efforts to be implemented.\r\nFinally, I mentioned our goal is and remains to be growing market share in 2014 while continuing to deliver solid earnings. We were successful with this objective in the last calendar quarter of 2013 according to the data available to us. However, we compete against great companies in our industry, and they, too, are aggressively modifying their business.\r\nWhile we are improving, we clearly see where we can improve our selling proposition, and we are focused on those areas. Our organization understands the importance of balancing investments and returns, and we have to invest our time and capital accordingly.\r\nWith the continued aging of the car population, we are optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. While new car sales have been very strong these past 2 years, we have seen those traded-in vehicles be resold to new owners who are repairing and enhancing their \"new vehicle.\"\r\nWith gas prices declining a bit here recently on a year-over-year basis, we believe miles driven can increase in 2014. Historically, lower gas prices and an improving economic outlook have led to more miles being driven. We expect that trend to reemerge.\r\nWe remain bullish on our industry sales growth opportunities on both retail and the commercial front over the long term. As the vehicle population remains at an all-time high and consumers continue to look for good values while maintaining their vehicles, we see AutoZone's opportunity to sell to these customers only growing.\r\nNow let me review our operating theme priorities for 2014. Our overarching operating theme this year is Creating Customers for Life, and the key priorities for the year are: One, Great People Providing Great Service!; two, profitably growing our commercial business; three, leveraging the Internet; four, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies; and finally, improving inventory availability.\r\nOn the retail front, this past quarter under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. Along with the completion of the rollout of our new Z-net software, we spent a great deal of time training AutoZoners on the system enhancements. We've tried to make the system as intuitive as possible, but along with change, we have to spend time teaching and discussing those changes.\r\nWe also learned from our store AutoZoners how to improve the way the information is presented on the screens. This mutual respect for operations and technologies will lead, in our belief, to a superior selling tool in our stores.\r\nWe also invested more payroll in our stores this past quarter. Last year, we managed expenses tightly, as our sales results were below our expectations. This year, as we expected sales to improve with all of our initiatives, we wanted to make sure we've represented our brand well so we added additional payroll.\r\nWe should highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we finished Q2 at 32.3%. While slightly below last year's Q2 ROIC, excluding the acquisition of AutoAnything, we would have been slightly higher than last year.\r\nWe are very pleased with this metric, as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hard lines retailing. Our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital.\r\nNow let me turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter.\r\nFor the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico stores and our 4 stores in Brazil, increased 6.5% over the 12 weeks. Regarding macro trends, during the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $3.29 a gallon and finished the quarter at $3.38 a gallon. Last year, gas prices increased $0.18 per gallon during the quarter, starting at $3.43 and ending at $3.61 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' abilities to maintain their vehicles, and we continue to monitor prices closely in the future.\r\nWe also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven data reported by the Department of Transportation are available only through December. But October was up 2.3%, while November was down 0.2%, December was up 1.1%.\r\nThe other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year-old and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor.\r\nAnother key macro headwind last year was the payroll tax reinstitution. While we do not expect to benefit this year, we simply are anniversarying a negative event from last year. It is hard to gauge what benefit this will have on our traffic, but it won't be an additional pressure point like it was last year.\r\nFor the trailing 4 quarters, total sales per auto parts store was $1,754,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry.\r\nFor the quarter, total commercial sales increased 12.2%. Commercial represented 16.3% of our total company sales and grew $35 million over last year's second quarter. Last year's commercial sales mix percent was 15.6%. We believe there are ample opportunities for us to continue to improve many facets of our operations and offerings. And therefore, we are optimistic about the future of this business.\r\nYear-to-date, we opened 170 new -- 174 new programs versus 93 programs opened last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 3,595 stores, supported by 160 hub stores. Approximately 1,080 of our programs are 3 years old or younger. With only 74% of our domestic stores having the commercial program and our average revenue per program below several of our competitors, we believe there is further opportunity for additional program growth, in addition to improved productivity opportunities in current programs.\r\nThe tests on inventory that we've conducted provide us with one of the pieces of information on how to close the gap with competitors that are more productive in commercial than us today on a per outlet basis. We understand where share opportunities exist, and we remain focused on closing that gap. We believe we're on the right track when it comes to our ability to climb the call list to becoming our customer's first call.\r\nIn summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We have accelerated the growth of our commercial programs, having opened over 1,000 programs in the past 36 months. 30% of the programs are 3 years old or younger, and we believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture market share.\r\nOur Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 4 new stores during the second quarter. We currently have 367 stores in Mexico. Our returns and profit growth continue to be in line with our expectations.\r\nRegarding Brazil, we opened no new stores in the quarter and have 4 stores open as of the end of the quarter. Our plans remain to open in total about 10 stores, then pause our development as we refine our offerings, and prove that our concept works for our customers and it's financially viable. At that point, we will talk more on our long-term growth plans.\r\nRecapping this past quarter's performance for the company. In total, our sales were $1,999,000,000, an increase of 7.3% from last year's second quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than 1 year were up 4.3% for the quarter.\r\nAs Bill had mentioned earlier, our last 4-week sales results were below the run rate of the first 8 weeks. We attribute much of this decline to even harsher-than-expected winter weather in certain parts of the country, keeping customers at home, indoors, along with an excessive amount of precipitation, challenging customers to complete vehicle projects outdoors.\r\nAdditionally, we believe many of the failure parts that were subject to failure during extreme temperatures had already failed earlier in the season.\r\nMoving on to gross profit. The gross margin for the quarter was 52.1% of sales, up 25 basis points versus last year's second quarter. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, lower shrink expense, offset primarily by the inclusion of the recent acquisition of AutoAnything. \r\nIn regards to inflation, we continue to see modest decreases in costs year-over-year. This is different than in past years. At this point, our assumption is we'll experience subdued producer pricing for the foreseeable future. And therefore, we feel costs will be predicable and manageable. We'll remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation, and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise.\r\nLooking forward, we continue to believe there remains an opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the retail and the commercial businesses. However, we do not manage to a targeted gross margin percentage. As the growth of our commercial business has been a steady headwind on our overall gross margin rate for a few years, we have not bothered to call out the headwind quarterly as an integrated part of our business model.\r\nAdditionally, AutoAnything has been a slight drag on our gross margins, as this business model operates at a lower gross margin rate. As we anniversary our acquisition of AutoAnything during Q2, our margin comparisons will be comparable going forward. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars.\r\nSG&A for the quarter was 35.2% of sales, higher by 42 basis points from last year's second quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the timing of advertising expenditures in Q2 from Q1.\r\nAs I had mentioned a few moments ago, our investments in store payroll did leverage our domestic -- or deleveraged our domestic store operating expenses as a percentage of sales. Advertising, however, was the largest single component to the increase.\r\nWhile expenses were higher than last year, they were budgeted to be higher and were in line with our expectations. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.\r\nEBIT for the quarter was $337 million, up 6.2% over last year's second quarter. Our EBIT margin was 16.9%. This represented a decrease of 17 basis points versus the previous year's second quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was $39.5 million compared with $41.3 million in Q2 a year ago. \r\nDebt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,311,000,000 or approximately $310 million more than last year's Q2 balance of $3,998,000,000. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. Our share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.\r\nFor the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.3%, lower than last year's second quarter of 36.2%. This quarter benefited from certain discrete tax items. Net income for the quarter of $193 million was up 9.4% versus the prior year's second quarter. Our diluted share count of 34.3 million was down 7.2% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $5.63, up 17.8% over the prior year's second quarter.\r\nRelated to the cash flow statement, for the second fiscal quarter, we generated $151 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 6.5% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $77 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 32 new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodels, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments.\r\nAdditionally, we purchased the rights to certain customer relationships in connection with our ALLDATA business. These investments were approximately $11 million this year, with an additional $20 million to be paid over the next 2 years. For all of fiscal 2013, our CapEx was approximately $415 million.\r\nWith the new stores opened, we finished this quarter with 4,871 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 367 stores in Mexico; and 4 in Brazil, for a total store count of 5,242. Depreciation totaled $58.4 million for the quarter versus last year's second quarter expense of $52.3 million.\r\nWith our excess cash flow, we purchased -- repurchased $200 million of AutoZone stock in the second quarter. At quarter end, we had $727 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. Our leverage metric was 2.5x this past quarter. Again, I want to stress, we manage through appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy.\r\nAccounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 113%.\r\nNext I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $3.1 billion, up 12% versus the Q2 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects new store growth, along with additional investments and coverage for select categories. Inventory per store was up 8.3% at $589,000 per store, reflecting our continued investments in hard parts coverage.\r\nFinally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 32.3%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.\r\nNow I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Bill. We are pleased to report our 30th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth. Our company continues to be successful due to our long-term focus. That focus on exceptional customer service is part of the AutoZone DNA.\r\nWe focus on executing at a very high level consistently, which we believe can be a competitive advantage. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. Success will be achieved with a strong attention to detail.\r\nBut we also have to evolve and change to adapt to our ever-evolving industry. The initiatives we are working around inventory assortment, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, E-Commerce and Brazil are all very exciting to us. We feel these efforts will lead to increasing sales for 2014 and beyond.\r\nWhile our industry sales, according to the NPD data made available to us, accelerated this past quarter, we continued to experience share gains on both the retail and commercial fronts. While this is exciting, we cannot be complacent. We are just starting to implement our major initiatives. And the best, we believe, is ahead of us.\r\nOur long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. As we continue to execute on our financial model, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits.\r\nWe feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is right. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter over time. Our belief is solid, consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success. We're investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance.\r\nIn the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives.\r\nNow we'd like to open up the call for questions.",

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. \r\nRegarding the second quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with the slides complementing our comments today, is available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.\r\nTo begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another very good quarter. This morning, we reported our 30th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth. That accomplishment is a testament to our organization's focus and discipline around delivering consistent WOW! Customer Service. \r\nLet's spend some time this morning discussing our sales results and provide you some details on regional and product sales trends. We'll also provide some detail on the cadence of sales throughout the 12-week quarter. Next, we will update you on our digital integration initiatives and our international store performance. Finally, we'll highlight what we've been doing to improve our business model for today and beyond. We're very excited about the initiatives we're working on and believe our recent learnings will help to shape our company's future for years to come.\r\nFor the quarter, we reported total sales increase of 7.3%, while same-store sales were up 4.3%. This overall sales performance showed noticeable improvement from our Q1 results. I do want to point out that part of the increase in DIY was due to the calendar shift resulting from our 53rd week in fiscal 2013. Our DIY same-store sales would have been approximately 1% lower if we were comparing to the same weeks last year.\r\nCommercial continued to outpace the growth of our retail business. This quarter, retail showed marked acceleration from recent trends. The colder weather across much of the U.S. drove robust traffic on batteries antifreeze and wiper blades.\r\nHowever, our West Coast stores experienced less favorable weather for parts failures. Abnormally dry conditions led to fewer, for example, wiper blade sales in our stores on the West Coast. We also experienced growth in both traffic and ticket across both our retail and commercial customer segments. Our failure-related hard part categories experienced the highest growth in both retail and commercial.\r\nClearly, the weather was a significant factor, but we also believe that work that we have been doing to improve inventory availability had us very well positioned to capitalize on the increased demand. We feel as we've continued to improve our hard parts product availability, this has led to increasing traffic and ticket, especially in commercial where the vast majority of the business is in hard parts.\r\nIn regard to the cadence of sales trends for the quarter, November, December and through mid-January, our sales ran quite strong, above 5% in same-store sales. However, for the last month of our quarter, our same-store sales slowed. During those weeks, our results dropped into the low single-digit range. We experienced a slowdown across both our retail and commercial businesses.\r\nThe culprit, strange, as it is for me to say, was the weather. It seems I've spent a career talking about how weather, in particular extreme weather, drives positive results for us. But by late January, by the time several of the U.S. regions were experiencing their third or fourth heavy cold snap, the parts that were close to failing appeared to have already failed earlier in the season.\r\nAdditionally, the later storms, particularly across the Southeast, caused us and our commercial customers to close due to the severity of the storms and the poor driving conditions. As we look at the balance of the year, we believe there will be a lingering positive effect on our industry.\r\n2 years ago, the winter was quite mild, and we highlighted that as a headwind for our business for months. Conversely, after the extensive winter we have had this year, we anticipate that demand will remain strong as we head into the spring and summer seasons. While certain failure-related categories were particularly strong during the second quarter, other categories, specifically maintenance categories that can be deferred, were challenged. We expect these deferred projects to be completed in the balance of the year.\r\nRegarding the consumer, we continue to believe our consumer remains under pressure. However, we feel 2014 has several positive items going forward. One large headwind has now been anniversary-ed, the payroll tax reinstatement last year. Another is gas prices have begun to abate, and we believe this can have a positive effect on our customers' ability to spend on routine maintenance.\r\nWith approximately 10 billion of gasoline consumed monthly in the U.S., any sizable move in price can have a material stimulus on the economy. Currently, gasoline prices are approximately $3.35 a gallon, about $0.25 a gallon below this time last year.\r\nAs we are heading into what is forecast to be a more normal spring and summer weather pattern, we are optimistic on the sales front. We continue to assume the most pronounced effects will be felt in the Midwest and Northeast markets, as these have been the most challenged for a couple of years.\r\nRegarding market share, the data we have available to us is showing we're gaining share on both the retail and commercial fronts. We are especially focused on improving our trends in the application parts area where our efforts to improve our assortments would have the most impact.\r\nAnd so far, we are encouraged. We feel the initiatives we're working on are making a difference. For example, we have enhanced our electronic catalog to better serve our customers by further highlighting related items necessary to do the complete job. We believe these enhancements will improve the customer experience and will complement the knowledge of our AutoZoners. While we are early in our efforts, the feedback we're receiving from AutoZoners and customers is encouraging.\r\nRegarding DIY ticket and traffic trends, both increased for the quarter. As I previously mentioned, the traffic count was much stronger earlier in the quarter versus the last few weeks. While we've experienced traffic growth in commercial for several years, it was exciting to see growth in the retail channel.\r\nOn the average ticket front, retail continues to be up but at a lower rate than our historical experience. One driver of the lower retail ticket has been the lack of commodity-based inflation. Currently, we don't see any indications of that trend changing materially in the short to mid-term. While that is good news for our customers, it has certainly challenged our results.\r\nOn the commercial front, we were pleased to see a higher average ticket tied to as noted earlier, more hard parts sales. Overall, we don't have control over the macro factors that impact our business, and that is why we have intensified our efforts on enhancing our offerings. Our efforts on the initiatives we have underway or in test should lead to ongoing sales growth. \r\nWe're pleased with the progress we're making in our commercial business. Our sales increased 12.2% from last year's second quarter, and we opened 49 new programs to finish with 74% of our domestic stores having a commercial sales program. This brings our year-to-date openings to 174. We expect to open a similar number of programs this year as we did last year.\r\nOur all other businesses increased approximately 31% over last year. Starting this quarter, we began to anniversary our acquisition of AutoAnything. The all other segment of our business includes AutoAnything, autozone.com and ALLDATA.\r\nRegarding these businesses, we've introduced the idea of being more digitally integrated. Therefore, we've made this 1 of our 4 strategic growth priorities, along with retail, commercial and international. While in an early stage, we believe this can be an important and significant opportunity for us to deepen customer relationships and ultimately grow sales. \r\nAt this point in the evolution of our online offering, we're focusing more on data compilation and building a knowledge portal than on current sales. Today, shoppers use our websites for educating themselves on what they need for their vehicles, and they continue to buy the vast majority of what they need from our stores, which to us makes perfect sense and is in line with our operating plans. Our objective is to satisfy our customers' needs regardless of how they want to interact with us.\r\nNow I'd like to update you on our initiatives. Last quarter, we discussed that we were testing a handful of initiatives that focused on increasing our ability to say yes to our customers' parts needs in both retail and commercial. We established tests last summer focused on increasing the depth of coverage available at the store, hub stores and at our distribution centers. Product additions at the hub stores and distribution centers also included tests around frequency of delivery to the stores that they service.\r\nOver the last several months, we have significantly increased the pace of strategic assessments and challenged ourselves to review our test results very carefully. The amount of common effort going into this effort has been nothing short of extraordinary. Our entire organization owes the subset of individuals who are leading this effort tremendous gratitude.\r\nOn last quarter's call, we highlighted that one of our test initiatives was complete and in the process of being implemented. This initiative was the enhanced modeling for store SKU placements, where we would significantly add incremental inventory, while simultaneously removing unproductive inventory.\r\nAt the end of the quarter, we were complete with about 75% of this initiative. But it is important to note that much of this additional inventory began arriving at our stores very late in the quarter and some is still in the distribution centers. This has been a massive undertaking and has caused considerable work at the stores and in the distribution centers.\r\nAs you can see, our per store inventories increased significantly as a result of this initiative. We have a high degree of confidence that these new assortments will drive meaningful, profitable sales increases, as we tested this new methodology several times before implementation.\r\nTo date, the sales are generally in line with our expectations. But again, much of the inventory hasn't been positioned for sale or was positioned very late in the quarter.\r\nWe've also been testing additional inventory in our hub stores. We continue to find opportunities to add productive inventory to all of our hubs, and we expect this to continue, especially as we further penetrate the highly fragmented commercial market.\r\nAdditionally, we are testing a much deeper product offering in a select few hub stores, and these locations are leveraging that inventory across a wide network of additional hubs and satellites. This allows us to significantly broaden the depth of the product offering closer to the customer, with many stores having same-day access to the broad assortment.\r\nIn addition to testing broader SKU assortments in our hubs and in our distribution centers, we are also testing more frequent deliveries to both select hub and satellite stores. All of these efforts are designed to assess the most effective way to service our customers' needs and to reduce the amount of unproductive activity we have transferring products from store to store. It is still very early. But what we have learned, as we expected, that more inventory closer to the customer increases sales. At this stage, we have not determined the optimal solution, and we expect to continue to run these tests for an extended period of time.\r\nWe continue to execute on our strategies to improve the customer shopping experience. We expanded 5 net additional hub locations during the quarter to take our total remodeled hubs to 115 locations. These remodels entail expanding the size and capacity of these locations, ensuring they are in the right physical location and adding additional inventory into the market that benefits both retail and commercial.\r\nWe also opened 3 new hub stores, finishing with 160. Over time, we do expect to open more hub locations, but we believe our strategy on inventory deployment at the store level allows us to keep the number of openings at a moderate level.\r\nLast quarter, I also mentioned the new version of Z-net that was being deployed. Over the last couple of years, we have reset our expectations in regard to technology investments in an effort to leverage technology to enhance the customer experience and leverage operating efficiencies. The enhanced Z-net is the first of those efforts to be implemented.\r\nFinally, I mentioned our goal is and remains to be growing market share in 2014 while continuing to deliver solid earnings. We were successful with this objective in the last calendar quarter of 2013 according to the data available to us. However, we compete against great companies in our industry, and they, too, are aggressively modifying their business.\r\nWhile we are improving, we clearly see where we can improve our selling proposition, and we are focused on those areas. Our organization understands the importance of balancing investments and returns, and we have to invest our time and capital accordingly.\r\nWith the continued aging of the car population, we are optimistic regarding trends for our industry in both DIY and DIFM. While new car sales have been very strong these past 2 years, we have seen those traded-in vehicles be resold to new owners who are repairing and enhancing their \"new vehicle.\"\r\nWith gas prices declining a bit here recently on a year-over-year basis, we believe miles driven can increase in 2014. Historically, lower gas prices and an improving economic outlook have led to more miles being driven. We expect that trend to reemerge.\r\nWe remain bullish on our industry sales growth opportunities on both retail and the commercial front over the long term. As the vehicle population remains at an all-time high and consumers continue to look for good values while maintaining their vehicles, we see AutoZone's opportunity to sell to these customers only growing.\r\nNow let me review our operating theme priorities for 2014. Our overarching operating theme this year is Creating Customers for Life, and the key priorities for the year are: One, Great People Providing Great Service!; two, profitably growing our commercial business; three, leveraging the Internet; four, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies; and finally, improving inventory availability.\r\nOn the retail front, this past quarter under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. Along with the completion of the rollout of our new Z-net software, we spent a great deal of time training AutoZoners on the system enhancements. We've tried to make the system as intuitive as possible, but along with change, we have to spend time teaching and discussing those changes.\r\nWe also learned from our store AutoZoners how to improve the way the information is presented on the screens. This mutual respect for operations and technologies will lead, in our belief, to a superior selling tool in our stores.\r\nWe also invested more payroll in our stores this past quarter. Last year, we managed expenses tightly, as our sales results were below our expectations. This year, as we expected sales to improve with all of our initiatives, we wanted to make sure we've represented our brand well so we added additional payroll.\r\nWe should highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we finished Q2 at 32.3%. While slightly below last year's Q2 ROIC, excluding the acquisition of AutoAnything, we would have been slightly higher than last year.\r\nWe are very pleased with this metric, as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hard lines retailing. Our primary focus has been and continues to be that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship as the capital we invest is our investors' capital.\r\nNow let me turn the call over to Bill Giles. Bill?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: William Giles (Executives)】\nThanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and international results for the quarter.\r\nFor the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico stores and our 4 stores in Brazil, increased 6.5% over the 12 weeks. Regarding macro trends, during the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $3.29 a gallon and finished the quarter at $3.38 a gallon. Last year, gas prices increased $0.18 per gallon during the quarter, starting at $3.43 and ending at $3.61 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' abilities to maintain their vehicles, and we continue to monitor prices closely in the future.\r\nWe also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven data reported by the Department of Transportation are available only through December. But October was up 2.3%, while November was down 0.2%, December was up 1.1%.\r\nThe other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year-old and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor.\r\nAnother key macro headwind last year was the payroll tax reinstitution. While we do not expect to benefit this year, we simply are anniversarying a negative event from last year. It is hard to gauge what benefit this will have on our traffic, but it won't be an additional pressure point like it was last year.\r\nFor the trailing 4 quarters, total sales per auto parts store was $1,754,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry.\r\nFor the quarter, total commercial sales increased 12.2%. Commercial represented 16.3% of our total company sales and grew $35 million over last year's second quarter. Last year's commercial sales mix percent was 15.6%. We believe there are ample opportunities for us to continue to improve many facets of our operations and offerings. And therefore, we are optimistic about the future of this business.\r\nYear-to-date, we opened 170 new -- 174 new programs versus 93 programs opened last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 3,595 stores, supported by 160 hub stores. Approximately 1,080 of our programs are 3 years old or younger. With only 74% of our domestic stores having the commercial program and our average revenue per program below several of our competitors, we believe there is further opportunity for additional program growth, in addition to improved productivity opportunities in current programs.\r\nThe tests on inventory that we've conducted provide us with one of the pieces of information on how to close the gap with competitors that are more productive in commercial than us today on a per outlet basis. We understand where share opportunities exist, and we remain focused on closing that gap. We believe we're on the right track when it comes to our ability to climb the call list to becoming our customer's first call.\r\nIn summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We have accelerated the growth of our commercial programs, having opened over 1,000 programs in the past 36 months. 30% of the programs are 3 years old or younger, and we believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture market share.\r\nOur Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 4 new stores during the second quarter. We currently have 367 stores in Mexico. Our returns and profit growth continue to be in line with our expectations.\r\nRegarding Brazil, we opened no new stores in the quarter and have 4 stores open as of the end of the quarter. Our plans remain to open in total about 10 stores, then pause our development as we refine our offerings, and prove that our concept works for our customers and it's financially viable. At that point, we will talk more on our long-term growth plans.\r\nRecapping this past quarter's performance for the company. In total, our sales were $1,999,000,000, an increase of 7.3% from last year's second quarter. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores opened more than 1 year were up 4.3% for the quarter.\r\nAs Bill had mentioned earlier, our last 4-week sales results were below the run rate of the first 8 weeks. We attribute much of this decline to even harsher-than-expected winter weather in certain parts of the country, keeping customers at home, indoors, along with an excessive amount of precipitation, challenging customers to complete vehicle projects outdoors.\r\nAdditionally, we believe many of the failure parts that were subject to failure during extreme temperatures had already failed earlier in the season.\r\nMoving on to gross profit. The gross margin for the quarter was 52.1% of sales, up 25 basis points versus last year's second quarter. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, lower shrink expense, offset primarily by the inclusion of the recent acquisition of AutoAnything. \r\nIn regards to inflation, we continue to see modest decreases in costs year-over-year. This is different than in past years. At this point, our assumption is we'll experience subdued producer pricing for the foreseeable future. And therefore, we feel costs will be predicable and manageable. We'll remain cognizant of future developments regarding inflation, and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise.\r\nLooking forward, we continue to believe there remains an opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the retail and the commercial businesses. However, we do not manage to a targeted gross margin percentage. As the growth of our commercial business has been a steady headwind on our overall gross margin rate for a few years, we have not bothered to call out the headwind quarterly as an integrated part of our business model.\r\nAdditionally, AutoAnything has been a slight drag on our gross margins, as this business model operates at a lower gross margin rate. As we anniversary our acquisition of AutoAnything during Q2, our margin comparisons will be comparable going forward. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars.\r\nSG&A for the quarter was 35.2% of sales, higher by 42 basis points from last year's second quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the timing of advertising expenditures in Q2 from Q1.\r\nAs I had mentioned a few moments ago, our investments in store payroll did leverage our domestic -- or deleveraged our domestic store operating expenses as a percentage of sales. Advertising, however, was the largest single component to the increase.\r\nWhile expenses were higher than last year, they were budgeted to be higher and were in line with our expectations. We continue to believe we are well positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.\r\nEBIT for the quarter was $337 million, up 6.2% over last year's second quarter. Our EBIT margin was 16.9%. This represented a decrease of 17 basis points versus the previous year's second quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was $39.5 million compared with $41.3 million in Q2 a year ago. \r\nDebt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,311,000,000 or approximately $310 million more than last year's Q2 balance of $3,998,000,000. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. Our share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.\r\nFor the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.3%, lower than last year's second quarter of 36.2%. This quarter benefited from certain discrete tax items. Net income for the quarter of $193 million was up 9.4% versus the prior year's second quarter. Our diluted share count of 34.3 million was down 7.2% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $5.63, up 17.8% over the prior year's second quarter.\r\nRelated to the cash flow statement, for the second fiscal quarter, we generated $151 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 6.5% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $77 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 32 new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodels, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments.\r\nAdditionally, we purchased the rights to certain customer relationships in connection with our ALLDATA business. These investments were approximately $11 million this year, with an additional $20 million to be paid over the next 2 years. For all of fiscal 2013, our CapEx was approximately $415 million.\r\nWith the new stores opened, we finished this quarter with 4,871 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 367 stores in Mexico; and 4 in Brazil, for a total store count of 5,242. Depreciation totaled $58.4 million for the quarter versus last year's second quarter expense of $52.3 million.\r\nWith our excess cash flow, we purchased -- repurchased $200 million of AutoZone stock in the second quarter. At quarter end, we had $727 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. Our leverage metric was 2.5x this past quarter. Again, I want to stress, we manage through appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy.\r\nAccounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 113%.\r\nNext I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $3.1 billion, up 12% versus the Q2 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects new store growth, along with additional investments and coverage for select categories. Inventory per store was up 8.3% at $589,000 per store, reflecting our continued investments in hard parts coverage.\r\nFinally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 32.3%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.\r\nNow I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nThanks, Bill. We are pleased to report our 30th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth. Our company continues to be successful due to our long-term focus. That focus on exceptional customer service is part of the AutoZone DNA.\r\nWe focus on executing at a very high level consistently, which we believe can be a competitive advantage. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. Success will be achieved with a strong attention to detail.\r\nBut we also have to evolve and change to adapt to our ever-evolving industry. The initiatives we are working around inventory assortment, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, E-Commerce and Brazil are all very exciting to us. We feel these efforts will lead to increasing sales for 2014 and beyond.\r\nWhile our industry sales, according to the NPD data made available to us, accelerated this past quarter, we continued to experience share gains on both the retail and commercial fronts. While this is exciting, we cannot be complacent. We are just starting to implement our major initiatives. And the best, we believe, is ahead of us.\r\nOur long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. As we continue to execute on our financial model, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits.\r\nWe feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is right. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter over time. Our belief is solid, consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success. We're investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance.\r\nIn the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives.\r\nNow we'd like to open up the call for questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "A couple of questions, if I may. First one for Bill Rhodes. Bill, you spoke about a lingering positive effect from weather on hard parts. And while it's easy to probably determine what the immediate effect is on battery, can you maybe provide a little bit more color on how long you think that lingering effect is going to be and what proportion of the hard parts are typically affected longer term from adverse weather?\n\n---\n\nYes. Alan, and I think the best proxy that we have in recent history was 2 years ago when we had a very mild winter of 2011, 2012. If you recall, in April and really on through October of that year, we continued to talk about the lingering impact in our business. And it was really in the maintenance categories, places like brakes and chassis that did not -- frankly, didn't get replaced at the same rates that they had in previous years. We attribute a lot of that to the lack of snow and ice, lack of snowplows, lack of potholes in the roads. And clearly, coming out of the winter that we just had, our expectation is that those categories should be robust. Also those categories, typically that I've talked about, brakes and chassis and the like, they were challenged during Q2. We had great performance in batteries and wipers and antifreeze. But a lot of our categories where the customers could defer and they did defer, and we expect those deferrals to come back.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So Bill, would you say -- is the positive effect this year from the poor weather equal to the poor effect we had on revenue just a couple of years ago from the unseasonably warm weather that we had?\n\n---\n\nYour guess is as good as mine on that one, Alan. I'm just -- I'm bullish about it, but we're going to see how it plays out.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Second question maybe for Bill Giles. Bill, with less than 30% of the hub stores under 3 years old, what is the ramp on the revenue growth at newly opened hub stores look like? Is most of the maturity captured post 3 years? If you can maybe provide a little bit more color on that, we'd appreciate it.\n\n---\n\nYes. Actually, unlike a traditional retail new store, a lot of it is captured really in the first 2 to 3 years, so there's a continued ramp in the maturation post that. But there's a much more accelerated ramp in the first, frankly, couple of years and sometimes even shorter than that, depending on the market that we get into. And then the other thing that in addition to having increase in the maturation process of the new commercial programs, it's just all the initiatives that we're doing. So we're trying to make every program better every single day. And a lot of the things that Bill talked about on the inventory availability, we think, will help in that process.\n\n---\n\nOkay. One last question, if I may, for Bill Rhodes. Obviously, with one of your major competitors completing the acquisition of CARQUEST recently, there was certainly -- it was well documented that CARQUEST was on the auction block for quite some time. Are you at liberty to maybe elaborate on what it was about CARQUEST that did not interest you in moving forward more aggressively?\n\n---\n\nThat's a tough question, Alan. I think I'd rather keep our deliberations to ourselves. I think those could have competitive implications over the long term and in other industry consolidations. I appreciate the question and I understand it. I just don't think it will be appropriate for us to comment on it.\n\n---\n\nBill Rhodes, a question on the inventories entering the next quarter, 8% higher than a year ago. Is this all additional SKUs? Or were you finding you didn't have enough depth in the existing SKUs to fulfill commercial orders? So for example, maybe your system shows you a stock with 2 pieces of a certain SKU, but I get a commercial customer asking for 4 pieces. And therefore, you were having to say no.\n\n---\n\nYes. What you're seeing to date is the vast majority of this has been incremental coverage, not incremental quantities. We are -- as I mentioned, we are testing a lot of different things. And in some respects, some of those tests are increasing or decreasing the quantities of the parts that we have based on the delivery frequency of that store. But what you've seen to date, the vast majority of it has been incremental coverage. I did want to reiterate that a lot of it came in right at the end of the quarter.\n\n---\n\nYou talked about your management doing a lot of analytical work on the payback on the inventory investment. Could you help us understand the implications for GMROI? I'm assuming it's probably dilutive, but if you could tell us what you were seeing in your tests.\n\n---\n\nYes, certainly. As we go farther down the curve, farther down the bell curve, it is clearly GMROI dilutive to where we are today. But let's remember, we're at 32.30% ROIC. So a lot of the decisions -- opening a new store, a lot of times is dilutive to ROIC. We're very comfortable that it's going to provide us with what -- reasonable returns well ahead of our cost of capital.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just the last question, I know we talked about this in the past, but when you look at your tests and improve your delivery capabilities in commercial, what do you think are the advantages and what are the disadvantages relative to competitors who have built large distribution centers and seemed to achieve a lot of the same benefits?\n\n---\n\nWell, obviously, the disadvantages of a significantly changed or significantly broader distribution network are it's costly, it's quite costly. And so we are looking at several different things, and we have made no decisions at this point in time on the other initiatives. We've rolled out our improved algorithms for store placements, but we have not made any decisions about distribution centers, hub stores or the like. We're in the midst of testing all of those things. But we're encouraged by all the different things that we're testing. What we now have to move to figure out is which one is the optimal approach, which one provides the best return at the lowest cost. And I think that's going to take us a couple -- 2 or 3 more quarters to figure that out.\n\n---\n\nSo a couple of questions on the commercial. I just want to go back, you said, Bill Giles, that stores that are 2 or 3 years old in the commercial business ramp up quite well in terms of the sales and, in fact, even faster than the retail business. So I guess I don't fully understand why you wouldn't be seeing greater sales in the commercial business if you have so many immature stores, so many stores in that 1% to 2% to 3% or 3-year-old cohorts. Shouldn't those be driving higher sales growth?\n\n---\n\nThey do. And then -- but at the same time, we still have -- keep in mind, 30% of the commercial programs that we have opened today are all less than 3 years old. So they're continuing to ramp, and that's driving down a little bit of our productivity when you look at it on an average basis. And then the other thing is, obviously, we're at 74% penetration. And as we continue to ratchet that up, there'll be some level of cannibalization, not significant, but there'll be a little bit until we just continue to penetrate the market overall.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So yes, I guess, that explains why the sales per store would be lower. But still, I would think the growth rate would be higher. And so perhaps, and here's my second question, is there a function of increased competition in the commercial business? On the West Coast, O'Reilly is maturing more and more every year with their CSK stores. And then in the Northeast, they did the VIP acquisition. So is it possible that you're just seeing more competition in the commercial business?\n\n---\n\nI wouldn't say more because, obviously, those are replacements of existing competition...\n\n---\n\nBetter perhaps?\n\n---\n\nYes, I would say that they're slightly better capitalized. But we've got a 3% market share or less. We continue to believe there's a lot of greenfield opportunities, and we've got to continue to drive our productivity. I also think the inventory availability -- and not to hang our hats just on that, we've got a lot of initiatives going on. But I think more inventory in the marketplace is going to be beneficial to the commercial programs, both DIY and commercial, but specifically commercial as well.\n\n---\n\nMy question's really about the inventory addition and its impact on ticket and what it does to the AP ratio going forward. Specifically, did you -- is it too early or did the increased SKUs help ticket in either Do-It-For-Me or DIY in the quarter?\n\n---\n\nThat's a great question. I think it's a little too early for us to see whether or not those -- that inventory, and as Bill said, it's still -- some of it is still in the pipeline, has an impact on ticket. We would expect it to drive it a little bit overall, as we continue to be able to say yes to more demand in the future. From an AP-to-inventory ratio perspective, I think over time that, that will likely put a little bit of pressure on AP-to-inventory. But I suspect that will be over a couple of year kind of a time frame. I don't see that in the immediate future necessarily. But it also points to the fact that we've got opportunity to try to reduce some of the unproductive inventory that we have in the chain, as we continue to replace this with other additional SKUs. So net-net, we're going to grow inventory, grow SKUs. It will put a little bit of pressure on inventory churn, which will put a little bit of pressure on AP-to-inventory ratio. But I suspect that, that will be over a couple of years and not something in the immediate future.\n\n---\n\nAnd you mentioned 75% of the initiative is done in terms of the enhanced SKU placements. If you look at all the other things that you listed that are still in tests, could you help us understand the magnitude? If you decide to go through with those, would it be a lift in inventory similar to what we've seen so far per store?\n\n---\n\nGreg, this is Bill Rhodes. Number one, all the initiatives that we're working on are competing against each other. So you have a delivery methodology frequency change out of the distribution centers. But at the same time, you also have a mega hub notion that's doing the same kind of work. So we don't really -- it's hard to say what's going to happen. When I look at it, I don't think there would be nearly as significant increase in inventory as a result of these initiatives because you would be talking about deploying inventory in fewer number of locations, either hubs or distribution centers. This is not talking about additional inventories in the stores. And if you increase the frequency of delivery, you're also going to be able to bring the quantities of inventory in the stores down. So that could actually be a benefit to inventory, but it would require capital and operating expenses to get that benefit.\n\n---\n\nBill, would you comment a little bit, a follow-up on Alan's question a little bit about the frequency change as far as the route deliveries? I mean, I know some of those hub stores are going maybe once, twice, maybe even 3x a day to some of these stores. Could you talk a little bit more about that? And how does this -- the bay or the garage know that you have this additional inventory?\n\n---\n\nThat's a great question. How does the garage know? The way that they know is our incredibly talented sales force is out. Anytime you give a salesperson or an operator additional inventory, they're going to tell everybody, and so that's a big part of our sales message right now. As far as the frequency of deliveries in the standard hub stores, we really haven't changed those in the last 2 or 3 years. We did increase them pretty significantly in the '09, '10 time frame. But now we're testing something, and this is again just in test. And it's kind of a mega hub notion where it's a hub serving additional hubs. So think of 1 hub that might be servicing 6 or 7 other hubs. And if they're in the same major metropolitan areas, it might be serving that additional hub multiple times a day. And then for the long faraway hubs, it's only servicing them once a day.\n\n---\n\nAnd just to follow that, in periods when these bays and garages are very busy, does that give the opportunity to that third and fourth player in the market to really move up on that call list because of the increased demand?\n\n---\n\nI think increased demand, but more importantly, increased availability. When that shop finds that you have something that somebody else doesn't, that gives you real opportunity to move up that list, particularly if you're doing a great job with service.\n\n---\n\nOne question and a follow-up. The first one is about volatility. Some of the metrics that we see are kind of steady as ever. EPS growth being in this 15% to 17% range. Cash flow, you mentioned, is very predictable and steady. SG&A a little bit more volatile and sales a little bit more than historical. But can you talk to us about the underlying patterns of customer behavior that you're seeing intra-quarter, intra-week to understand kind of what it is that the customer's kind of preferring? And just wondering if you can give us a historical perspective on volatility.\n\n---\n\nYes. Number one, the second quarter for us is always an incredibly volatile period of time. It's the most volatile period of time that we have. Number one, you have the holidays in there. Number two, weather patterns are -- can be extremely different one week to the next. Last weekend, it was 70 degrees here in Memphis. Today, the kids -- Shelby County schools are out because of ice and snow. So those kinds of changes will really change the volatility or the customer traffic patterns. The other thing that's been different for us, we talked about is our average ticket. Our average ticket for about the last 9 months has been -- it's still growing, but it's been more muted growth. And a big part of that is due to the lack of commodity-based inflation. We had significant commodity-based inflation for a couple of years, and that slowed down a little bit. We think that will continue for a reasonable period going forward. We don't see it changing.\n\n---\n\nLet me follow up, if it's okay, on your comment earlier, Bill Rhodes, about inventory and kind of willing to put inventory in so long as it's kind of in excess of your cost of capital. How do you philosophically think about inventory when your cost of capital is effectively 0? And what are the guardrails telling us when it's going to hit that diminishing return?\n\n---\n\nWe hold everything to a 15% after-tax IRR. So regardless of what happens to our cost of capital, we're going to hold every investment to a 15% IRR, with the exception of a few real estate decisions that we make in strategic markets where we have to hold them -- we hold them to at least to 12%.\n\n---\n\nHow does payables factor into that? Because that effectively makes the cost of adding inventory free in that regard.\n\n---\n\nYes. We charge the initiative with payable -- with the inventory and don't give it the payables benefit, although we let it -- some of the inventory come back at the end of the IRR calculation period. The burden of those costs are real. And just because we're able to get the AP coverage on doesn't mean that we don't need to look at that very closely and make sure that we're making wise business decisions.\n\n---\n\nA couple of questions as another question around inventory. I guess, if you look at some of the puts and takes, the scale of purchasing the incremental inventory versus the possibly lower margin of growing the commercial business and the gross margin improvement year-over-year, could you sort of give us the impact of both sides of that?\n\n---\n\nI would say that the increase in the inventory during the quarter had some additional supply chain costs, et cetera, but there wasn't a benefit per se from the additional purchasing of the inventory that would necessarily flow through gross margin at least at this stage. It wouldn't happen until the inventory is sold necessarily. So that's the financials, Bret.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then, I guess, as you talked about market share, could you give us any color regionally where there markets that you've gained relatively more share in?\n\n---\n\nYes. The information that we get today about market share is not at the same level of granularity on a regional basis. We only get regional information on non-application products. So I don't really think it's wise for us to get into those discussions.\n\n---\n\nNow that you've had time to see the results of both the inventory and the labor investments, do you think these initiatives will get you -- allow you to fully close the commercial productivity gap with your peers? And is that the goal here? Or do you think that if you do close the productivity gap, it will be return dilutive, and you don't necessarily want to get there?\n\n---\n\nNumber one, we want to focus on us, not our competition. We believe we have tremendous opportunities for increased business in the commercial business over time. We don't think it's going to come 1 week or 1 quarter or 1 year. It's going to take us improving our model, continuing to work with our sales force, continuing to deepen our relationship with our customers. I believe that the initiatives that we're working on, particularly the inventory availability initiatives, will have a big benefit to us going forward. But it's not going to be measured in quarters, it's going to be measured in years. As for the inventory that we added, again, I'll reiterate that we added it right at the end of the quarter, so you didn't see much of it. As far as the payroll addition, and I appreciate you calling that out, we really -- last year, the second quarter was really tight and our sales trends weren't very exciting. And so we very aggressively managed our payroll. And in hindsight, we felt like we too aggressively managed it. So we didn't -- we weren't that aggressive this time. Now that was a 1 quarter event. That was not something that we did in Q3 and Q4. It was really a Q2 event that we've now annualized.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And then my follow-up question, I think some of your comments around the cadence of the comp during the quarter have raised some questions about the sustainability of the recent industry performance. Could you parse, maybe on a regional perspective, did you see the same type of slowdown on the West or the less weather-affected areas? And have you seen that continue into the current quarter where maybe there's been less adverse weather?\n\n---\n\nYes. We have kind of a standing practice not to talk about the current quarter, but I appreciate you bringing that up. So let me add a little bit more specifics to it. In the last month that we talked about, there were 3 weeks. The first 3 weeks of that month where it was snow and ice across much of the eastern United States, including the south. Those 3 weeks, we had significant pressure on our sales. The final week of the quarter, we had much improved weather, and our business was materially better. That also coincided with when the tax refunds started flowing in the marketplace. So we had the combination of improved weather and tax refunds, and we saw a material improvement in our business.\n\n---\n\nI think you just helped us understand the calendar shift a bit with that last week being so strong. But going forward, should we expect any changes with the calendar shifts in the balance of the year?\n\n---\n\nWe -- it cost us 70 bps in the first quarter. It helped us about 1% here. I think it should be -- it's certainly going to be neutral for the balance of the year. Could there be a slight shift between Q3 and Q4, it's going to depend. Just like you picked up on, it wasn't going to be a big event until we had a really strong last week. And then it became that event. I can't -- I know what the first week of this quarter is going to be, but I don't know what the last one's going to be. So I think it's anybody's guess.\n\n---\n\nGot you, okay. And just picking apart the SG&A deleverage in the quarter a bit. Can you give us the puts and takes year-over-year as it relates to some of the line items around payroll and advertising, et cetera? And were there any incremental investments for your initiatives?\n\n---\n\nI would say that there wasn't a lot of incremental investments on the initiatives. There were some additional costs. I think payroll deleveraged probably less than 10 basis points or so. But to Bill's point earlier, that was really a function of us kind of keeping more consistent with our payroll model, where last year we probably got off of that a little bit. And we really made some cuts that, in retrospect, we didn't want to repeat as we went through Q2. In Q1, we mentioned that there was going to be some timing related to advertising, where we pushed some advertising from Q2 -- or Q1 into Q2, and that was worth probably a little over 20 basis points. So that's kind of the majority of that 42 basis points.\n\n---\n\nI have just a couple really quick questions. While we've already discussed weather a lot, but is there a way just to simply look, if you take the comp you had in the fiscal second quarter, how much of that was directly attributable to the weather? And then the second question, I think you -- to some extent, you discussed it in your prepared comments, but the buyback, looking at my model here, you obviously continue to buy back stock, but it would seem like a slight -- or modestly slower pace than it had been in prior quarters. Any read -- any reasons we should be thinking something into that?\n\n---\n\nI'll take the first and I'll give Bill Giles the second one. It's really difficult to quantify the impact of the weather. And again, it has puts and calls. So we can see that our batteries and starters, and alternators businesses are up pretty significantly. Conversely, brakes and chassis and the like are down. I think it did have a benefit. I would characterize it in the 1% to 2% range. But I also think that we've got this pent-up demand, which should help us going forward. We love the extremes. But if you don't get the extreme weather and those batteries don't fail, then it's going to be the next extreme when they do fail. So we got that business, and now hopefully we'll get the deferrable maintenance business as we look forward.\n\n---\n\nAnd I would just say nothing to really read on the stock repurchases. We're trying to be relatively consistent year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter. So I wouldn't read too much into that.\n\n---\n\nYou mentioned the tight payroll a couple of times, just talking about the year-over-year SG&A. I'm curious, did that lead to changes in employee turnover at all? And in addition to that, with some of the industry consolidation we've seen, is employee turnover a greater concern maybe than what's been in the past?\n\n---\n\nNo, no, we haven't seen any material change in employee turnover. We did see a material reduction when the onset of the recession, and we've seen it tick up 1% or 2% over certain quarters. But it is nothing material, whatsoever. As far as the industry dynamics, I think, number one, it's far too early to see what any ramifications of those changes are. But we're always looking for great people that love the AutoZone culture. And if they want to come join a great team, we'd love to have them.\n\n---\n\nAnd when do you think that might play out? You said it's still too early. Just given your experience in the industry and obviously with acquisitions themselves, like when would we start to see when people are kind of placing their longer-term bet, is it after 3 months, is it 6 months, is it a year? Just kind of, given your experience, wondering what your thought process is.\n\n---\n\nIt all depends on what the strategy is and what the level of execution on that strategy is. It can happen very quickly, if there's a massive determination on what the integration plans are, or it can take a year. It's all going to depend on the implementation phase.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Before we conclude the call, I'd just like to take a moment to reiterate what separates us from the other players in our industry. Our culture is very unique. Being part of the AutoZone family and striving to improve is very unique across the entire retail landscape. It's the passion to continue to build our culture that will carry us to new heights. We are currently working on a variety of exciting new initiatives and tests that we believe will enhance our performance over time. Ultimately, our AutoZoners have delivered year in and year out, and I'm highly confident that with them leading the charge, our future is incredibly bright. Thank you for participating in today's call.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Alan Rifkin (Analysts)】\nA couple of questions, if I may. First one for Bill Rhodes. Bill, you spoke about a lingering positive effect from weather on hard parts. And while it's easy to probably determine what the immediate effect is on battery, can you maybe provide a little bit more color on how long you think that lingering effect is going to be and what proportion of the hard parts are typically affected longer term from adverse weather?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes. Alan, and I think the best proxy that we have in recent history was 2 years ago when we had a very mild winter of 2011, 2012. If you recall, in April and really on through October of that year, we continued to talk about the lingering impact in our business. And it was really in the maintenance categories, places like brakes and chassis that did not -- frankly, didn't get replaced at the same rates that they had in previous years. We attribute a lot of that to the lack of snow and ice, lack of snowplows, lack of potholes in the roads. And clearly, coming out of the winter that we just had, our expectation is that those categories should be robust. Also those categories, typically that I've talked about, brakes and chassis and the like, they were challenged during Q2. We had great performance in batteries and wipers and antifreeze. But a lot of our categories where the customers could defer and they did defer, and we expect those deferrals to come back.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alan Rifkin (Analysts)】\nOkay. So Bill, would you say -- is the positive effect this year from the poor weather equal to the poor effect we had on revenue just a couple of years ago from the unseasonably warm weather that we had?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYour guess is as good as mine on that one, Alan. I'm just -- I'm bullish about it, but we're going to see how it plays out.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alan Rifkin (Analysts)】\nOkay. Second question maybe for Bill Giles. Bill, with less than 30% of the hub stores under 3 years old, what is the ramp on the revenue growth at newly opened hub stores look like? Is most of the maturity captured post 3 years? If you can maybe provide a little bit more color on that, we'd appreciate it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nYes. Actually, unlike a traditional retail new store, a lot of it is captured really in the first 2 to 3 years, so there's a continued ramp in the maturation post that. But there's a much more accelerated ramp in the first, frankly, couple of years and sometimes even shorter than that, depending on the market that we get into. And then the other thing that in addition to having increase in the maturation process of the new commercial programs, it's just all the initiatives that we're doing. So we're trying to make every program better every single day. And a lot of the things that Bill talked about on the inventory availability, we think, will help in that process.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alan Rifkin (Analysts)】\nOkay. One last question, if I may, for Bill Rhodes. Obviously, with one of your major competitors completing the acquisition of CARQUEST recently, there was certainly -- it was well documented that CARQUEST was on the auction block for quite some time. Are you at liberty to maybe elaborate on what it was about CARQUEST that did not interest you in moving forward more aggressively?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nThat's a tough question, Alan. I think I'd rather keep our deliberations to ourselves. I think those could have competitive implications over the long term and in other industry consolidations. I appreciate the question and I understand it. I just don't think it will be appropriate for us to comment on it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nBill Rhodes, a question on the inventories entering the next quarter, 8% higher than a year ago. Is this all additional SKUs? Or were you finding you didn't have enough depth in the existing SKUs to fulfill commercial orders? So for example, maybe your system shows you a stock with 2 pieces of a certain SKU, but I get a commercial customer asking for 4 pieces. And therefore, you were having to say no.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes. What you're seeing to date is the vast majority of this has been incremental coverage, not incremental quantities. We are -- as I mentioned, we are testing a lot of different things. And in some respects, some of those tests are increasing or decreasing the quantities of the parts that we have based on the delivery frequency of that store. But what you've seen to date, the vast majority of it has been incremental coverage. I did want to reiterate that a lot of it came in right at the end of the quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nYou talked about your management doing a lot of analytical work on the payback on the inventory investment. Could you help us understand the implications for GMROI? I'm assuming it's probably dilutive, but if you could tell us what you were seeing in your tests.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes, certainly. As we go farther down the curve, farther down the bell curve, it is clearly GMROI dilutive to where we are today. But let's remember, we're at 32.30% ROIC. So a lot of the decisions -- opening a new store, a lot of times is dilutive to ROIC. We're very comfortable that it's going to provide us with what -- reasonable returns well ahead of our cost of capital.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nAnd then just the last question, I know we talked about this in the past, but when you look at your tests and improve your delivery capabilities in commercial, what do you think are the advantages and what are the disadvantages relative to competitors who have built large distribution centers and seemed to achieve a lot of the same benefits?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nWell, obviously, the disadvantages of a significantly changed or significantly broader distribution network are it's costly, it's quite costly. And so we are looking at several different things, and we have made no decisions at this point in time on the other initiatives. We've rolled out our improved algorithms for store placements, but we have not made any decisions about distribution centers, hub stores or the like. We're in the midst of testing all of those things. But we're encouraged by all the different things that we're testing. What we now have to move to figure out is which one is the optimal approach, which one provides the best return at the lowest cost. And I think that's going to take us a couple -- 2 or 3 more quarters to figure that out.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Baker (Analysts)】\nSo a couple of questions on the commercial. I just want to go back, you said, Bill Giles, that stores that are 2 or 3 years old in the commercial business ramp up quite well in terms of the sales and, in fact, even faster than the retail business. So I guess I don't fully understand why you wouldn't be seeing greater sales in the commercial business if you have so many immature stores, so many stores in that 1% to 2% to 3% or 3-year-old cohorts. Shouldn't those be driving higher sales growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nThey do. And then -- but at the same time, we still have -- keep in mind, 30% of the commercial programs that we have opened today are all less than 3 years old. So they're continuing to ramp, and that's driving down a little bit of our productivity when you look at it on an average basis. And then the other thing is, obviously, we're at 74% penetration. And as we continue to ratchet that up, there'll be some level of cannibalization, not significant, but there'll be a little bit until we just continue to penetrate the market overall.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Baker (Analysts)】\nOkay. So yes, I guess, that explains why the sales per store would be lower. But still, I would think the growth rate would be higher. And so perhaps, and here's my second question, is there a function of increased competition in the commercial business? On the West Coast, O'Reilly is maturing more and more every year with their CSK stores. And then in the Northeast, they did the VIP acquisition. So is it possible that you're just seeing more competition in the commercial business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nI wouldn't say more because, obviously, those are replacements of existing competition...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Baker (Analysts)】\nBetter perhaps?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nYes, I would say that they're slightly better capitalized. But we've got a 3% market share or less. We continue to believe there's a lot of greenfield opportunities, and we've got to continue to drive our productivity. I also think the inventory availability -- and not to hang our hats just on that, we've got a lot of initiatives going on. But I think more inventory in the marketplace is going to be beneficial to the commercial programs, both DIY and commercial, but specifically commercial as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nMy question's really about the inventory addition and its impact on ticket and what it does to the AP ratio going forward. Specifically, did you -- is it too early or did the increased SKUs help ticket in either Do-It-For-Me or DIY in the quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nThat's a great question. I think it's a little too early for us to see whether or not those -- that inventory, and as Bill said, it's still -- some of it is still in the pipeline, has an impact on ticket. We would expect it to drive it a little bit overall, as we continue to be able to say yes to more demand in the future. From an AP-to-inventory ratio perspective, I think over time that, that will likely put a little bit of pressure on AP-to-inventory. But I suspect that will be over a couple of year kind of a time frame. I don't see that in the immediate future necessarily. But it also points to the fact that we've got opportunity to try to reduce some of the unproductive inventory that we have in the chain, as we continue to replace this with other additional SKUs. So net-net, we're going to grow inventory, grow SKUs. It will put a little bit of pressure on inventory churn, which will put a little bit of pressure on AP-to-inventory ratio. But I suspect that, that will be over a couple of years and not something in the immediate future.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nAnd you mentioned 75% of the initiative is done in terms of the enhanced SKU placements. If you look at all the other things that you listed that are still in tests, could you help us understand the magnitude? If you decide to go through with those, would it be a lift in inventory similar to what we've seen so far per store?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nGreg, this is Bill Rhodes. Number one, all the initiatives that we're working on are competing against each other. So you have a delivery methodology frequency change out of the distribution centers. But at the same time, you also have a mega hub notion that's doing the same kind of work. So we don't really -- it's hard to say what's going to happen. When I look at it, I don't think there would be nearly as significant increase in inventory as a result of these initiatives because you would be talking about deploying inventory in fewer number of locations, either hubs or distribution centers. This is not talking about additional inventories in the stores. And if you increase the frequency of delivery, you're also going to be able to bring the quantities of inventory in the stores down. So that could actually be a benefit to inventory, but it would require capital and operating expenses to get that benefit.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Lawrence (Analysts)】\nBill, would you comment a little bit, a follow-up on Alan's question a little bit about the frequency change as far as the route deliveries? I mean, I know some of those hub stores are going maybe once, twice, maybe even 3x a day to some of these stores. Could you talk a little bit more about that? And how does this -- the bay or the garage know that you have this additional inventory?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nThat's a great question. How does the garage know? The way that they know is our incredibly talented sales force is out. Anytime you give a salesperson or an operator additional inventory, they're going to tell everybody, and so that's a big part of our sales message right now. As far as the frequency of deliveries in the standard hub stores, we really haven't changed those in the last 2 or 3 years. We did increase them pretty significantly in the '09, '10 time frame. But now we're testing something, and this is again just in test. And it's kind of a mega hub notion where it's a hub serving additional hubs. So think of 1 hub that might be servicing 6 or 7 other hubs. And if they're in the same major metropolitan areas, it might be serving that additional hub multiple times a day. And then for the long faraway hubs, it's only servicing them once a day.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Lawrence (Analysts)】\nAnd just to follow that, in periods when these bays and garages are very busy, does that give the opportunity to that third and fourth player in the market to really move up on that call list because of the increased demand?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nI think increased demand, but more importantly, increased availability. When that shop finds that you have something that somebody else doesn't, that gives you real opportunity to move up that list, particularly if you're doing a great job with service.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Aram Rubinson (Analysts)】\nOne question and a follow-up. The first one is about volatility. Some of the metrics that we see are kind of steady as ever. EPS growth being in this 15% to 17% range. Cash flow, you mentioned, is very predictable and steady. SG&A a little bit more volatile and sales a little bit more than historical. But can you talk to us about the underlying patterns of customer behavior that you're seeing intra-quarter, intra-week to understand kind of what it is that the customer's kind of preferring? And just wondering if you can give us a historical perspective on volatility.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes. Number one, the second quarter for us is always an incredibly volatile period of time. It's the most volatile period of time that we have. Number one, you have the holidays in there. Number two, weather patterns are -- can be extremely different one week to the next. Last weekend, it was 70 degrees here in Memphis. Today, the kids -- Shelby County schools are out because of ice and snow. So those kinds of changes will really change the volatility or the customer traffic patterns. The other thing that's been different for us, we talked about is our average ticket. Our average ticket for about the last 9 months has been -- it's still growing, but it's been more muted growth. And a big part of that is due to the lack of commodity-based inflation. We had significant commodity-based inflation for a couple of years, and that slowed down a little bit. We think that will continue for a reasonable period going forward. We don't see it changing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Aram Rubinson (Analysts)】\nLet me follow up, if it's okay, on your comment earlier, Bill Rhodes, about inventory and kind of willing to put inventory in so long as it's kind of in excess of your cost of capital. How do you philosophically think about inventory when your cost of capital is effectively 0? And what are the guardrails telling us when it's going to hit that diminishing return?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nWe hold everything to a 15% after-tax IRR. So regardless of what happens to our cost of capital, we're going to hold every investment to a 15% IRR, with the exception of a few real estate decisions that we make in strategic markets where we have to hold them -- we hold them to at least to 12%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Aram Rubinson (Analysts)】\nHow does payables factor into that? Because that effectively makes the cost of adding inventory free in that regard.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes. We charge the initiative with payable -- with the inventory and don't give it the payables benefit, although we let it -- some of the inventory come back at the end of the IRR calculation period. The burden of those costs are real. And just because we're able to get the AP coverage on doesn't mean that we don't need to look at that very closely and make sure that we're making wise business decisions.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bret Jordan (Analysts)】\nA couple of questions as another question around inventory. I guess, if you look at some of the puts and takes, the scale of purchasing the incremental inventory versus the possibly lower margin of growing the commercial business and the gross margin improvement year-over-year, could you sort of give us the impact of both sides of that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nI would say that the increase in the inventory during the quarter had some additional supply chain costs, et cetera, but there wasn't a benefit per se from the additional purchasing of the inventory that would necessarily flow through gross margin at least at this stage. It wouldn't happen until the inventory is sold necessarily. So that's the financials, Bret.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bret Jordan (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then, I guess, as you talked about market share, could you give us any color regionally where there markets that you've gained relatively more share in?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes. The information that we get today about market share is not at the same level of granularity on a regional basis. We only get regional information on non-application products. So I don't really think it's wise for us to get into those discussions.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nNow that you've had time to see the results of both the inventory and the labor investments, do you think these initiatives will get you -- allow you to fully close the commercial productivity gap with your peers? And is that the goal here? Or do you think that if you do close the productivity gap, it will be return dilutive, and you don't necessarily want to get there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nNumber one, we want to focus on us, not our competition. We believe we have tremendous opportunities for increased business in the commercial business over time. We don't think it's going to come 1 week or 1 quarter or 1 year. It's going to take us improving our model, continuing to work with our sales force, continuing to deepen our relationship with our customers. I believe that the initiatives that we're working on, particularly the inventory availability initiatives, will have a big benefit to us going forward. But it's not going to be measured in quarters, it's going to be measured in years. As for the inventory that we added, again, I'll reiterate that we added it right at the end of the quarter, so you didn't see much of it. As far as the payroll addition, and I appreciate you calling that out, we really -- last year, the second quarter was really tight and our sales trends weren't very exciting. And so we very aggressively managed our payroll. And in hindsight, we felt like we too aggressively managed it. So we didn't -- we weren't that aggressive this time. Now that was a 1 quarter event. That was not something that we did in Q3 and Q4. It was really a Q2 event that we've now annualized.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's helpful. And then my follow-up question, I think some of your comments around the cadence of the comp during the quarter have raised some questions about the sustainability of the recent industry performance. Could you parse, maybe on a regional perspective, did you see the same type of slowdown on the West or the less weather-affected areas? And have you seen that continue into the current quarter where maybe there's been less adverse weather?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes. We have kind of a standing practice not to talk about the current quarter, but I appreciate you bringing that up. So let me add a little bit more specifics to it. In the last month that we talked about, there were 3 weeks. The first 3 weeks of that month where it was snow and ice across much of the eastern United States, including the south. Those 3 weeks, we had significant pressure on our sales. The final week of the quarter, we had much improved weather, and our business was materially better. That also coincided with when the tax refunds started flowing in the marketplace. So we had the combination of improved weather and tax refunds, and we saw a material improvement in our business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Seth Basham (Analysts)】\nI think you just helped us understand the calendar shift a bit with that last week being so strong. But going forward, should we expect any changes with the calendar shifts in the balance of the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nWe -- it cost us 70 bps in the first quarter. It helped us about 1% here. I think it should be -- it's certainly going to be neutral for the balance of the year. Could there be a slight shift between Q3 and Q4, it's going to depend. Just like you picked up on, it wasn't going to be a big event until we had a really strong last week. And then it became that event. I can't -- I know what the first week of this quarter is going to be, but I don't know what the last one's going to be. So I think it's anybody's guess.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Seth Basham (Analysts)】\nGot you, okay. And just picking apart the SG&A deleverage in the quarter a bit. Can you give us the puts and takes year-over-year as it relates to some of the line items around payroll and advertising, et cetera? And were there any incremental investments for your initiatives?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nI would say that there wasn't a lot of incremental investments on the initiatives. There were some additional costs. I think payroll deleveraged probably less than 10 basis points or so. But to Bill's point earlier, that was really a function of us kind of keeping more consistent with our payroll model, where last year we probably got off of that a little bit. And we really made some cuts that, in retrospect, we didn't want to repeat as we went through Q2. In Q1, we mentioned that there was going to be some timing related to advertising, where we pushed some advertising from Q2 -- or Q1 into Q2, and that was worth probably a little over 20 basis points. So that's kind of the majority of that 42 basis points.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Nagel (Analysts)】\nI have just a couple really quick questions. While we've already discussed weather a lot, but is there a way just to simply look, if you take the comp you had in the fiscal second quarter, how much of that was directly attributable to the weather? And then the second question, I think you -- to some extent, you discussed it in your prepared comments, but the buyback, looking at my model here, you obviously continue to buy back stock, but it would seem like a slight -- or modestly slower pace than it had been in prior quarters. Any read -- any reasons we should be thinking something into that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nI'll take the first and I'll give Bill Giles the second one. It's really difficult to quantify the impact of the weather. And again, it has puts and calls. So we can see that our batteries and starters, and alternators businesses are up pretty significantly. Conversely, brakes and chassis and the like are down. I think it did have a benefit. I would characterize it in the 1% to 2% range. But I also think that we've got this pent-up demand, which should help us going forward. We love the extremes. But if you don't get the extreme weather and those batteries don't fail, then it's going to be the next extreme when they do fail. So we got that business, and now hopefully we'll get the deferrable maintenance business as we look forward.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nAnd I would just say nothing to really read on the stock repurchases. We're trying to be relatively consistent year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter. So I wouldn't read too much into that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scot Ciccarelli (Analysts)】\nYou mentioned the tight payroll a couple of times, just talking about the year-over-year SG&A. I'm curious, did that lead to changes in employee turnover at all? And in addition to that, with some of the industry consolidation we've seen, is employee turnover a greater concern maybe than what's been in the past?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nNo, no, we haven't seen any material change in employee turnover. We did see a material reduction when the onset of the recession, and we've seen it tick up 1% or 2% over certain quarters. But it is nothing material, whatsoever. As far as the industry dynamics, I think, number one, it's far too early to see what any ramifications of those changes are. But we're always looking for great people that love the AutoZone culture. And if they want to come join a great team, we'd love to have them.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scot Ciccarelli (Analysts)】\nAnd when do you think that might play out? You said it's still too early. Just given your experience in the industry and obviously with acquisitions themselves, like when would we start to see when people are kind of placing their longer-term bet, is it after 3 months, is it 6 months, is it a year? Just kind of, given your experience, wondering what your thought process is.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nIt all depends on what the strategy is and what the level of execution on that strategy is. It can happen very quickly, if there's a massive determination on what the integration plans are, or it can take a year. It's all going to depend on the implementation phase.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nGreat. Before we conclude the call, I'd just like to take a moment to reiterate what separates us from the other players in our industry. Our culture is very unique. Being part of the AutoZone family and striving to improve is very unique across the entire retail landscape. It's the passion to continue to build our culture that will carry us to new heights. We are currently working on a variety of exciting new initiatives and tests that we believe will enhance our performance over time. Ultimately, our AutoZoners have delivered year in and year out, and I'm highly confident that with them leading the charge, our future is incredibly bright.

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Alea. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal 2014 third quarter results. Joining me on the call today are Bill Cobb, our President and CEO; and Greg Macfarlane, our CFO. Jason Houseworth, President, Global Digital and Product Management, will be available during the Q&A session.\r\nIn connection with this call, we have posted today's press release on the Investor Relations website at hrblock.com. Some of the figures that we'll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We reconcile the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures and the schedules attached to our press release.\r\nBefore we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under our securities -- under the securities laws. Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially. You can learn more about these risks in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2013 and our other SEC filings. H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements.\r\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Colby, and good afternoon, everyone. Earlier today, we released our U.S. tax return volume through February 28, as well as our fiscal 2014 third quarter results.\r\nAs you may know, we had 1 day of return filings included in our results, and expected that we see a timing variance between the third and fourth quarters. We had a significant amount of returns pending at January 31, and you'll notice a much larger shift of revenues into the fourth quarter compared to last year.\r\nIn total, approximately $277 million of revenue shifted to our fiscal fourth quarter this year, representing completed returns that had not yet been e-filed with the IRS by January 31. When taking this revenue shift into account, you will find that our revenues in the U.S. were essentially flat to the third quarter last year despite a decrease in returns prepared. Greg will offer more details of the third quarter financial results later during the call.\r\nWith respect to the tax season, there's obviously been a lot of early noise in the market, so I'd like to provide a few key points about the industry and our performance so far this year. First, for the second consecutive tax season, we've seen some unusual movement in the industry during the early part of the season, making initial year-over-year comparisons very challenging. Most notably, IRS data has indicated that the industry has experienced an early shift in the mix of assisted and DIY e-filed returns.\r\nDuring the first half of the season, however, the proportion of DIY filers typically is higher than in the second half of the season due to the fact that DIY returns are generally less complex. Additionally, as we mentioned at our Investor Day, we also believe that there's a real secular shift underway with Earned Income filers who also typically file their returns earlier in the year. Heading into this season, we've seen a trend in which returns containing the Earned Income Credit are increasingly being filed digitally. In fact, without this shift in EIC tax filers over the last 5 years, the overall proportion of DIY returns in the industry would have declined. And though the data is not segmented by filing channel, the IRS estimated in 2012 that there were between $12 billion and $14 billion in improperly issued Earned Income Credit payments.\r\nIncreased standards have been put in place to address these improper payments in the assisted channel only. If asking additional questions is a way to help reduce improper EIC payments, it makes sense that across all channels, all EIC filers, whether assisted or DIY, should have to answer the same questions. Thus, without significant changes in standards for filing DIY returns for these credits, we believe that similar shifts may continue to impact the mix of assisted to DIY filers, particularly in the early part of each tax season.\r\nThat said, we have seen this mix moderate over the last few weeks. And despite the unusual movements in the early season, recent IRS data has shown that total filings are now in line with our overall expectations for the year. The IRS just released data earlier today showing industry filings through February 28 up 1.4% over the prior year. Additionally, the data shows a continued and expected moderation in the assisted-DIY split from earlier reports. Therefore, we continue to expect total U.S. filing growth in the industry of 0% to 1%, and believe that for the full year, the proportion of filers who choose assistance versus those who do it themselves will remain relatively consistent with past seasons.\r\nThe second point I'd like to make is that we are executing very well against our objectives. You'll recall from our Investor Day in December that we detailed our multi-year Tax Plus strategy. This strategy is centered on driving higher revenues and profits through a balance of improved return mix and increased product attachment. To enable this strategy, we talked about investing in our offices to enhance the client experience and revamping our digital product to create a simplified and integrated user interface. We also introduced new product features to provide greater value to our clients and incented our tax professionals to promote the benefits of our Tax Plus products.\r\nWe entered this season with a deliberate and thoughtful plan to achieve this Tax Plus objective, and we are executing on this plan. We are smarter in our approach to the market and it's showing in our results. Most notably, we discontinued our Free EZ promotion in virtually all markets, which will result in an increase in revenues for the year. We enhanced our digital offerings, tailoring the product to each client and making it simpler to use. By better anticipating our clients' needs and matching them with the most appropriate product, we are seeing improved conversion and a substantial increase in product upgrades.\r\nOn the Tax Plus side, we've improved monetization through our financial services products with attached rates on Emerald Cards, refund transfers and peace of mind up across the board. We also continue to see improved users -- usage metrics in our Emerald Card with average deposit and reloader rates higher through the end of February compared to the prior year. And the Emerald Card continues to receive accolades. It was recently named by Paybefore, the leading information provider for the prepaid industry, as winner of their Top of Wallet and Best in Category awards as the best everyday use card with the most features and lowest cost structure.\r\nFinally, from a marketing perspective, I'm thrilled with our campaign this year, which has served as a reminder that taxes are complex and millions of Americans leave money on the table each year by not seeking professional assistance. Taxes are more complex than ever, and with the Affordable Care Act presenting the most significant change to the tax code in the past 20 years, filing taxes will not get any easier. In fact, we conducted a study last year that found that tax returns from nearly half of Americans who did it themselves contained inaccuracies. And for those who left money on the table, the additional amount owed to them was well over $1 billion.\r\nOur simple message of, Get Your Billion Back America, serves as a reminder that H&R Block is here to help. Based on market research, we know that our ads are resonating, as 75% of Americans are familiar with the campaign slogan, and for those that are familiar, 90% associate it with H&R Block. These results far exceeded our expectations in industry norms, and as a former marketer, I can tell you that these results are fabulous.\r\nPut simply, we are serving an improved mix of clients this year and improving how we serve them. Of course, we anticipated that our strategy, which focuses our resources on generating revenue growth would create some headwinds from a return count and market share perspective. In particular, these decisions have an impact on our early season volume results. However, this was a volume on which we made little or negative profit in prior years. This has also freed capacity in our tax offices, allowing us to better serve our clients, leading to improved Net Promoter Scores this season.\r\nIn assisted, our decision to eliminate Free EZ in virtually all markets disproportionally impacts the first half of the season. It is also expected to impact our client counts for the year. But we expect revenue from our EZ clients to increase more than offsetting the impact from lower return counts.\r\nSimilarly in digital, we made certain changes that required some of our more complex filers who are filing for free in previous years to upgrade to a paid product. Some of these clients have opted to use our competitors free or heavily discounted offerings. It simply does not make sense for us to focus our resources in areas in which we do not generate profits.\r\nAs a result, through February, total U.S. returns prepared by and through H&R Block were down 5.9% with assisted returns down 9%, slightly offset by a 1% increase in digital returns. While it's too soon to speculate exactly where we'll land in terms of returns or share this year, we do expect that the actions taken this season will impact our overall client counts and will likely reduce our return share in both assisted and digital. It's important to note, however, that this attrition is coming from returns that are prepared at little or negative profit.\r\nThe net result of these factors is that we're achieving exactly what we set out to do, driving higher revenue and earnings by focusing on improving our service through an improved mix of clients and increasing the rate at which those clients take our best-in-class financial services products.\r\nFinally, I'd like to discuss a topic that is extremely important to the industry and our country: fraud in the tax system. We believe the industry should be actively engaged in addressing this growing challenge and we are doing our part to contribute to the effort. We will host an event in Washington, D.C. on March 25 to stimulate conversation on this challenge among policy makers, influencers and other stakeholders.\r\nWhen we last spoke to you at our Investor Day, we noted 2 specific short-term opportunities for improving fraud prevention. Applying the eligibility questions asked of our earned income credit filers in the assisted channel to those filing in the DIY channel, and IRS oversight and regulation of tax preparers and software developers. \r\nI talked earlier to the earned income credit filers and the need for consistent standards between DIY and assisted EIC returns. So I'd now like to mention a few thoughts on the IRS oversight and regulation issue.\r\nLast month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the IRS does not have authority under current law to regulate tax preparers. This, despite the fact that it was Congress who issued a mandate requiring the IRS to implement such standards.\r\nWith an ever-increasing rise in tax fraud, this ruling represents a loss for honest taxpayers. In a country where all 50 states regulate the way you get your haircut, it's hard to understand why all consumers don't receive basic protections on what, for many, is their most significant financial transaction of the year, filing their taxes.\r\nNow earlier this week, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a comprehensive set of regulations that will better protect consumers who hired tax preparers in the State of New York. While this is a positive step forward, millions of consumers throughout the U.S. still do not enjoy these basic protections. Thus, we will continue to vigorously support efforts to better serve and protect consumers through minimum standards for and the oversight of all tax preparation. \r\nWhile we will continue to work with states that are considering regulating tax preparation, we look forward to working with Congress and the Treasury Department on any legislation that may be necessary to implement minimum federal standards, and we expect there to be a short-term effort to create a voluntary system for credentialing. We welcome the opportunity to work with the IRS in this interim step to set the standards and begin to get -- and begin to better protect consumers and prevent fraud.\r\nSo in conclusion, we're executing against our plans and are on track to achieve our primary objectives in growing both revenues and earnings this year. However, there is plenty of tax season ahead, and we have a lot of work to do between now and April 15. We expect it will take the balance of the season for the industry to normalize to expected levels, but we're well positioned to serve our clients in the second half and to drive improved top and bottom line results. We look forward to sharing our second half tax results with you in late April.\r\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Greg to discuss details of our third quarter financial results.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. Given the seasonality of our business and the fact that significant majority of our revenue and earnings come in the fourth quarter, our third quarter results generally are not indicative of the results we expect to achieve for the full year. This was especially true as we experience a delay to the start of the tax season for a second consecutive year with the IRS opening its e-file system on January 31. As this was the last day of our fiscal quarter, it led to a material shift of revenues from our third quarter to our fourth quarter. Thus, for the fiscal third quarter, total revenues decreased to $200 million. \r\nFor accounting purposes, we recognize the revenue from a completed tax return once the return has been e-filed with the IRS. As a result of completed tax returns yet to be e-filed with the IRS at the end of January, approximately $277 million of revenue shifted from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. This shift was approximately $260 million more than the shift we experienced last year. Thus, third quarter revenues in the U.S. would have essentially been flat when taking the shift into account despite lower return volume.\r\nIn international markets, revenues were lower by approximately $11 million due to timing differences in our Australian operations. This overall decrease in revenues was partially offset by lower operating costs. \r\nIn total, our third quarter adjusted net loss from continuing operations was $209 million or $0.77 per share compared to $57 million or $0.21 per share in the prior year. For the full fiscal year, we continue to target adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 30%, consistent with fiscal 2013.\r\nAs we look at our overall financial position, our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong. As of January 31, total unrestricted cash was $437 million and total outstanding debt was $1.1 billion. Reductions in cash from the prior quarter reflect our normal operating cash requirements. Additionally, all outstanding commercial paper at January 31 was paid off in February.\r\nFinally, our third quarter effective tax rate was 38.8%. As we discussed in our Investor Day, we continue to focus on lowering our effective tax rate. As a reminder, however, due to significant one-time tax benefit received last year, we expect our effective tax rate in 2014 to more closely approximate pre-2013 levels.\r\nTurning to discontinued operations which include results of Sand Canyon, our fiscal third quarter net loss of $2 million was $1 million higher than the prior year. Sand Canyon continue to engage in settlement discussions with the counterparties from which it has received a significant majority of its asserted claims. Sand Canyon's accrual for contingent losses relating to reps and warrants remained unchanged at $159 million.\r\nTurning to H&R Block Bank, I realized that many of you are interested in an update as we continue to explore strategic alternatives. All I can say at this point is that we're pleased by the progress we've made over the past couple of months and continue to expect to have a transaction completed in time for the next tax season. We will continue to provide updates as we make progress.\r\nOne final housekeeping note before we turn it over for Q&A. This quarter, we've updated our reporting methodology for digital returns to be based primarily on accepted e-files. We believe this methodology is a more appropriate way to measure our performance, enhances comparability within the industry and also eliminates, from our counts, certain returns that could potentially be fraudulent. This change reinforces our position on fraud and is another example of our commitment to do the right thing. It's important to note that this is a one-time change and it does not impact how we view our share growth overall in the digital category over the last few years. We have included a table in our press release with historical return counts which reflects our updated reporting methodology.\r\nI know we've covered a lot in today's call. So with that, we're now ready for questions. Operator?",

This change reinforces our position on fraud and is another example of our commitment to do the right thing. It's important to note that this is a one-time change and it does not impact how we view our share growth overall in the digital category over the last few years. We have included a table in our press release with historical return counts which reflects our updated reporting methodology.\r\nI know we've covered a lot in today's call. So with that, we're now ready for questions. Operator?",
      "transcript_text3": "So just doing some math here. According to your press release, the assisted volumes through the end of the fiscal third quarter were down 10% and you said revenues were flattish. So should we read into that, that pricing is up around 10%? And then, kind of going a step further, in the press release it says that revenues in fiscal '14 have been  $200 million, and then you pushed off $277 million, and the previous year it was $472 million, so that kind of implies a 1% increase? So just trying to understand pricing or fee per return or revenue in general a little better.\n\n---\n\nYes, Tom, let me take it and then, Greg can maybe help you with the math. I'll tell the theory. It's very hard to just make a blanket statement like that, but churn's down, pricing up. A lot of this is the component of mix comes into play. So this will be the first of probably 14 times I'm going to say this, we are in halftime of the game, there's a lot of season left to go and really, the full picture will emerge once we have completed the season after April 15. But Greg, you want to do some of the math stuff?\n\n---\n\nYes, let me just talk quickly about the return counts. So really, the delta in our perspective is driven really by the Free EZ elimination. And as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, that those are really done at 0 or like minimal to negative value on the bottom line, but on the revenue, it was basically free. So that elimination, a lot of those people have actually are not paying us, so I guess that's the price increase, if you think of it that way, but we just think of it more of just getting rid of the promotional that we've had in the last 3 years. More broadly on pricing, we've outlined to you that we know as an industry, we've got pricing power. That's not lost on us. We go into the season, wanted to be much more strategic in how we handle pricing. We're quite pleased with how we've executed that and we'll be able to talk about that more at the end of the season with you. And also, just closing off this thought with Bill's point, which is mix is a very important part of this conversation, and we have been pleased with our mix thus far in the season.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then going on to pricing, I think a lot of us, and I think you agree that the Affordable Care Act is a big opportunity for you going forward. So just a little curious why you're willing to give up market share now given the level of customer attention ahead of kind of this big opportunity next year and going forward?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think, obviously, well, the intersection of taxes and health care really come into bear in fiscal '15. I think what we're trying to do is get our system ready to serve the clients that we want to serve. We are very focused on this Tax Plus strategy which is having tax returns and attaching our best-in-class financial services product. So I don't look at it as by giving away our service for free, that we've given up a lot from that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just finally, on the bank sale. Great to hear that you still expect to get a deal done by next tax season. But can you just give us an update on how long you think you would take to get a transaction completed to get through all the regulatory requirements and everything?\n\n---\n\nYes. So we remain committed to obviously selling our bank, we remain very much committed to selling world-class management products. Those 2 things aren't changing. We're simply transacting the bank for broader regulatory issues and capital issues related to the additional capital requirements that would be required. And we've been working on this for quite a while, and we actually know a lot about this specific in terms of what we're trying to sell for. As we looked last summer when we made the initial announcement with our previous partner, we'd outlined a timeline that is really announced in July, and we felt comfortable that we'd be able to commercially and operationally get things done at the time felt the regulatory process had enough time to. We had sort of felt that, that would be a mid-October, early November would be really the window that was important for us to hit this tax season. We sit here really halfway through the tax season very much just focused on executing the tax season and running our business. And we continue to believe that getting a solution in place for next tax season is going to happen at this point.\n\n---\n\nThis is Anj Singh dialing in for Hamzah Mazari. I was wondering if you can give us some color, one, on just more if you can be a little bit more explicit on what the attach rates and the metrics looks like on the Emerald Card that you mentioned?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think we'll be doing that at the end of the tax season. Again, first half of the season is one part of the game. Well, all that data will be coming forward at the end of the tax season.\n\n---\n\nI mean, we spent a lot of time in December describing all the progress the team has made on developing features and functions. We've seen double-digit year-over-year improvement in annual users. As we sort of stand halfway through the season, we're very pleased with executing that strategy. I think it will be a good story at the end of the season.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then the other question, building on the bank sale question earlier, can you comment on what your view is on what the optimum leverage might look on the balance sheet post you being regulated as a bank holding company?\n\n---\n\nYes. I'll go back to what Greg said, and then, Greg, if you want to comment on this specifically. Right now, we have 2 major priorities in the company, one is to put together a great tax season, and we are hopeful that, that will happen and we feel good about where we're at. And two is to get a transaction done, so that we do execute the goal that Greg outlined earlier that we'll have a bank partner by the -- by tax -- next year's tax season. That's where we're completely focused on. We are having discussions, obviously, about other elements of our business, but we're not prepared at this time to have any announcements around that.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to ask a little bit about what -- now that we are a few months into Affordable Care Act, some of the new rules attached to it, you've been doing some trials in Phoenix, you've been -- you have an interface online for consumers to go buy health insurance. How happy are you with the results so far? Is -- are the online results better? The physical store presence resonating more with your customers? What's the update on those initiatives?\n\n---\n\nYes, we're not going to go through specific numbers. Here's what I would say. Obviously, this whole initiative got off to a rocky start. There's now stability at healthcare.gov. I think the White House said today, enrollment will definitely end March 31 next year. We just got word, it's now going to be a 90-day enrollment period between November 15 and February 15. And the reason why I'm starting to answer your question in this way is, this is such a fluid situation. What I'm most pleased about is the fact that we are in the game, we are learning, we are talking to clients, we are seeing what matters,  we're trying to reduce confusion. It is still a very hazy initiative for a number of clients. I think this is going to help us. I think we've pointed out in the Analyst Day presentation, there are 46 changes to the tax code associated with this initiative. So by being in the middle of this both for the DIY product and a direct-assisted product, we have learned an awful lot, and that really was the goal for this year. We had signaled that there would be an EPS hit of, I think, it was $0.03 to $0.04, Greg. And that -- really, that was part of the cost of getting the website up to speed, getting the offices in Phoenix ready, and really just being prepared to learn in this business. I don't know if you have anything to add in that, Greg.\n\n---\n\nNo, just an observation, Gil, to share with you. So we've outlined in December, I think, a fairly detailed explanation of why we think this is an exciting opportunity for the tax preparation industry. And now that we're halfway through the tax season, we have spent a lot of time at our competitors' locations, we've been spending a lot of time looking at the competitive offerings online. And it's our belief that the amount of investment, thought leadership that Block has done is disproportionately large than the entire rest of the industry combined, and that will benefit us as we think about next season. And I guess, I will also say that we've overinvested this year and it's highly likely we'll be over investing next year because we continue to believe this is a good opportunity for Block.\n\n---\n\nHow about the ability to charge directly for some of this? The IRS is likely to have a form next year and you charge per form. In Massachusetts, we're hearing that you're now charging for their health care form around the neighborhood of $5. Is that an indication of your ability to charge for this? Should we think of $5 as the price point? Or is there still work to do in terms of what an additional form would be priced next year at the national level?\n\n---\n\nYes, and again, I think I don't mean to, if you will, sidestep your question, but I think we do have to see the form. And I think the issue is, there are other considerations with regard to Massachusetts as we look at this, we really need to see the form, we really need to see how that 1095s are going to rollout, which is what everybody's going to be getting along with their W-2s next year. So all that intersection, we have to figure out. So I wouldn't make any assumptions on the particular price with regard to as we true-up folks next year and assess the impact of tax penalties on people who chose not to take insurance.\n\n---\n\nAnd relative to that, for what it's worth, Gil, I'll just mention, so we are charging in Massachusetts and frankly, probably should have done it historically, but part of the reason we're doing that is, I mean, we're incurring work and training time and we're doing value for our clients by that. But of course, there's broader lessons that we're trying to learn. But keep in mind that the Massachusetts form made materially different than what we see from the federal government, and that's what Bill is really trying to get at. We have to wait and see.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to get your thoughts on the impact so far this tax season, at least through February, because of no Free 1040EZ. Now how much of that 9% would you say is the result of not offering the preparation of 1040EZ?\n\n---\n\nMost of it. We're not going to get in the specifics, but the large, large majority of it is that decision.\n\n---\n\nAny thoughts on how much of it is -- I'm assuming it's weather and the Free 1040EZ, or has some of the weather stuff are -- have been made up by now?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think the weather stuff and actually, we have a young executive here who actually did a very expensive weather analysis for us, his geospatial work that he did to show the impact of how much snow has impacted literally each of the, I believe, it was 7,100 offices that got hit by snow this year. So we have a very good understanding of what the impact of the weather was. That is obviously starting to abate as the weather hopefully starts to normalize. So I think that weather, obviously, did have an impact. There were days, especially in places like Georgia, where we did 8% of the returns we were supposed to do on that particular day. So I would say that it was, again, a weird start to this season, there was for all retailers in a variety of businesses big impacts from the weather. The great thing about our industry is you have to come file. So I think, and I think we said this in our prepared remarks, everything's starting to normalize now. We've got 40 days and 40 nights left in the tax season, and we're really focused on the big finish here.\n\n---\n\nAnd then, Bill, you talked about, obviously, pricing is going to -- or revenues are going to be higher than what return count is going to be. Would you anticipate that in the first half pricing will be better than the second half? Or will it be the same throughout the tax season?\n\n---\n\nWhen you say pricing will be better, I assume you mean will be a higher percentage. Obviously, now charging $39 versus $0 last year, that's a monumental price increase that will appear to be. That's why Greg was talking about earlier the mix element of that by not having -- by not giving away our service for free. That is having an impact. So as we get into the second half where we're overlapping the same pricing on something like EZ, you're certainly going to see that start to normalize. In addition to that, and again, I think it's critical that we continue to focus on what is our core strategy and back to what we talked about in Analyst Day, Tax Plus or our ability to attach these financial services products that we are so proud of, that is a big component of our revenue drive. And while we have not given specific indication, I think Greg and I certainly, speaking for the company, feel very good about the way the field and the digital business has responded to attaching products.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just one final question, Bill. You talked a little bit about the online business, and I'm just wondering, the share loss you're seeing in the online business, is that strictly because of the pricing initiatives that you talked about, or is there a little bit more to it? Or maybe how you're going about marketing the product this year?\n\n---\n\nWhy don't I let Jason take a shot at that.\n\n---\n\nThanks for your question, Kartik. So as Bill mentioned, we have made some changes in our product that require more complex filers to upgrade, and this has led to a significant portion of what we see is why we trail the industry for an online perspective. But what I want to say is that, I'm really pleased with the results of our product redesign. And as I talked about in December, we're in year 1 of a 2-year redesign. And this year, we're seeing better conversion of our clients and a much better job of driving the growth in our average revenue per user. But I think that you have to consider results from a competitive perspective. And what I see is that we're in maturing digital industry. And my main competitor, Intuit, I have a lot of respect for, frankly, have seen our growth in online segment share the last 3 years, and this season, they appear to be using price as a lever to grow volume. And this is likely because they see parity with us from a product perspective, and it's our viewpoint that this isn't sustainable really in the long run. So with that said, there's a lot of season left, so stay tuned.\n\n---\n\nI'll start with the bank guys. So it sounds like no update yet, it sounds like you're confident you're on the timetable that you've been discussing recently. Some other guidelines you provide us in the past were that you had the ballpark of 5 or 6 final suitors with whom you were looking. The first question is, have you whittled that down? Are you comfortable in saying, yes, you're the final 1 or 2 right now? And then the second bank question is, you are also comfortable telling us not too far back that we should continue to think once a partnership's announced that the dilution would be similar to what it was that over public. Do you still feel that those are comfortable guidelines for us to think about as we move forward?\n\n---\n\nYes, so the message is really the same as we've been talking about. We're confident we're going to get this done. Our goals and motivations remain the same. We have wide and varied interests in doing business with Block. I'm really not going to get too much more specific at that point. But I want to make it clear that even though the message has not changed from your perspective, I don't want that to be misinterpreted. There's been a substantial amount of work in the last 3 months from our side, and we continue to feel very comfortable and confident that this will get resolved for next tax season. Now there's always a regulatory angle here that needs to be considered. We learned a lot from that last time, but we should never ignore the fact that there will be regulator approvals that have to go on here, and that, obviously, we're trying to factor into our decisions here. In terms of the form of the actual arrangement when we arrive at it, we'd be really premature to speculate on it what the actual commercial terms would be. But in terms of the general expectation, Scott, we would say we'd be fairly much in the ballpark of what we did with our previous announcement.\n\n---\n\nOkay. That's helpful on that. The -- I'm going to shift it over to tax now. Whatever went on our end of the phone is trying to figure out is how at this halftime point are revenues progressing? And Bill, one of your parting -- I think before you turned it over in the prepared remarks to the CFO, you said we are looking to drive, or I don't know if you said, but drive improved top and bottom line result, is that -- are we to take that literally in looking at the full year that you expect improved year-over-year top and bottom line results?\n\n---\n\nI think the answer is yes. I don't know, Greg, if you want to give any more...\n\n---\n\nNo, I mean, this is very consistent how we've talked about what we believe the opportunity of Block at this industry is you've got core growth every year. In this case, we think it will be 0% to 1% in terms of more returns in the industry. We continue to believe that even for the support in our view from the IRS' release this morning. The second thing is, we know we have pricing power, and that should add another point or two over time, so we sort of believe at Block that getting to 3% to 5% revenue top line is the right starting point for this conversation. That hasn't changed at all here. We, obviously, have come out of several year period where that's not been true, but the trend has been moving in the right direction. We have revenue growth last year for the first time, small growth, but still some growth. And of course, we believe from a fixed cost leverage and focus on expenses and productivity that, that should also have a bigger impact on the bottom line. We've shared with you during today's conversation that we think margins this year, EBITDA margins, will be in line with last year, which will be around 30%.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just because a bunch of my peers have obviously asked these questions, and in the same way, you obviously don't want to quantify the price impacts or the revenue impact here at halftime. But I think it's implied and what's being discussed, it will be a net positive by year end is what you're continuing to anticipate. Is -- and I think Tom has asked this, but are you comfortable saying within a couple of hundred basis points, your pricing growth is positive relative to the 9% negative? Or maybe even just talking on the total volume number of 5.6%. Is it fairly comparable at this halftime point, a little ahead, a little behind?\n\n---\n\nSo I want to be really clear here that if anyone is believing that price is up 9%, you're mistaken. I think you're really misunderstanding mix and some other sort of factors that will come in here in terms of attach rate and some of the other international things. So I think you really need to be careful when -- in terms of conclusions there. We're not going to go on record in terms of what the price increase is going to be. We'll talk about that more at the end of the season. But we're happy with how we're executing our pricing strategy this year. I think we'll be in much more nuanced this year, much more thoughtful because we're in this business for the long run.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And Greg, are you making a rate versus yield comment in that response? Obviously, mix is something that helps revenue per customer go up, but you're saying, hey, rate has not increased 9%, but could, in fact, the revenue per return, probably the bottom line and what people look at, could that still be in the same ballpark? I just want to make sure I understand the message.\n\n---\n\nSo my comments are really focused in on the specific price, the net price or the gross price how you think about it.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then on marketing, I see that, and I'm just curious if this is a timing issue. It looks like $77 million spent on that line item versus $99 million last year, please correct me if that's correct. But is that you're spending a lot less this year, or is that because of some timing of the third quarter versus the fourth quarter? And a follow-up to that is, how -- are you still -- are you looking to spend the same amount year-over-year? Are you going to get some efficiencies?\n\n---\n\nYes, I won't get into specific spending plans but what I will say is, when you have a campaign like we have with the impact it's had, with the great reception that it's gotten from consumers, you can get a lot of bang for the buck, and that's what we've gotten this year. It's a fabulous campaign, awareness is extremely high, all our field leaders are calling into our marketing group and saying, people are walking in the door saying, \"Give me my piece of the $1 billion back.\" It's really been very exciting to see. So whatever the -- if Greg wants to comment on any of the numbers, but really, what we need to do as a marketing-driven organization is really make sure that the impact from the messaging that we do is high, and I think we've certainly achieved that this year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. If I could add 2 more, 1 for Jason. Jason, a comment from -- I guess, it was from Greg mentioning the new reporting format of the digital category and how that's adjusted out for what you believe could have been fraudulent returns. Could you give us the old -- how it would have been reported otherwise? Or just a way for us to think about that as we compare you to some other industry peers. And any thoughts on perhaps, I know it's a stretch, but if others had adjusted their numbers a similar way, I just want to understand apples-to-apples comparison.\n\n---\n\nSo let me, Scott, if I can, just give you a bit more of a mechanical view, and then Jason can give you some broader thoughts. But I mean, the spirit of this is right, which is we're trying to really give you all the best estimate of how many Americans we help to file their taxes. And I think as time's gone on, we have missed that a little bit in some of the definitions, this change was really in the spirit of fixing that problem. It's really -- and when you kind of do the math and, by the way, afterwards if you want to -- anyone wants to call, they can go through the math with you. But in an absolute sense, the numbers have changed, but relatively speaking, they haven't changed at all. The market share gains that we've reported are basically dead on as they were before. But this, I think, is in the spirit of a much cleaner reporting. We do think it has better comparability and, of course, we're able to also spike out this fraud issue, which is a very real issue. And frankly, would be nice to see if some of our competitors recognize that as well.\n\n---\n\nAnd, Scott, the 2 things that we really took out specifically were online free returns that were printed instead of e-filed, and returns that were e-filed but rejected by the IRS, and that makes up the approximately 600,000 reduction from the FY '13 digital return counts. And I just want to make one last point which is that there was no revenue associated with any of these returns that were counted.\n\n---\n\nAll right, guys. That's helpful. One more, Bill, for you, if I could. I know that you've had discussions with folks at the Treasury with regard to if there will be a health care form next year, and you touched upon that a little bit today on what would be delivered with the W-2. But as far as the tax form, do you anticipate there will be -- do you -- is there progress on that? Just an update would be great.\n\n---\n\nYes, Scott. The only indications we received is that we will see the form, I think, the latest indication we have, this summer. I have certainly indicated in my conversations with the government officials that the sooner you can get that to us, the more I think we can weigh in and give advice. And maybe we'll see -- fresh eyes will see something in that, that has been received. Well -- but we have not -- none of the people in the tax institute or anything have seen the form yet. But we're hopeful that in the next few months, we'll get a peek at it.\n\n---\n\nFollowing up on some of the -- from many of the questions. Just to make sure, the IRS in counting their online, that's only accepted by the IRS, correct?\n\n---\n\nThat's correct, Michael.\n\n---\n\nRegarding the billion-dollar marketing campaign, can you give us some ideas how -- what impact that's had? I guess, quantify the impact and the source?\n\n---\n\nWell, again, I think I said this, what we track is we track consumer reaction to all the ads we do. Overall, the core message, which we've obviously been very focused on and zeroed in on, for -- this was, I think, 4 weeks into the campaign, it might have been 5 weeks, but we had 3 quarters of all Americans could recite the line. It's part of the consumer vernacular right now. And 90% of the people associated with Block, which for our marketers, sometimes you have a message and you don't know what brand it is. So we've been able to hit on both dimensions which is very exciting for us.\n\n---\n\nI think I should ask this a little differently. In terms of those coming in who cite the promotion, were they coming from do-it-yourself and coming to assisted? Were they coming from other places? Or were they Block clients who said, boy, I saw this, it was great?\n\n---\n\nYes, we don't disclose source of volume. But what I would say is, it's coming from all places in terms of the way this campaign has caught the imagination of America.\n\n---\n\nIn connection with, I guess, with the online, the assumption was that this was aimed to be online. And yes, you discussed it -- discussed the numbers, but it just seems that the IRS is 7.5% day-to-day is so much bigger than the number you cite, I guess, on a date-to-date as well. Is there some loss of share in there?\n\n---\n\nSorry, can you just be clear what the question is, Michael, please?\n\n---\n\nSo the IRS number today that was -- self-prepared up 7.5%, and you indicated that you dropped some of nonprofitable business. I was just trying to sort of reconcile numbers, if they're comparable and you reconcile, or if you're gaining share or losing share?\n\n---\n\nI'll just point back to Bill's comments as far as our strategy to really go -- to do 2 things this season. One is to look at more complex and high-value clients from a digital perspective and how do we attract those, and then the other to look at our large number of historically free clients and determine how can we create more value. And as he noted and how I also noted in my earlier comment, this decision has led to a significant portion of the delta that you mentioned.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Moving on, the -- you indicated a 3% to 5% revenue growth over the long term. If it's not been there, could we expect over the next several years better than 3% to 5% to get -- to average it out?\n\n---\n\nSo the 3% of 5% that I outlined earlier doesn't include the ability to take market share, it doesn't include the ability to attach and grow financial services products. As you all know also, our international business is growing at a faster rate. But at this point, let's just get to 3% to 5%, and then we'll talk about what's beyond that.\n\n---\n\nYes, and this is consistent with what Greg laid out at the Investor Day. This is, as he puts it, what we should expect over the long term, and we're certainly not talking about anything specifically about this year. We'll play the season out and then we'll be reporting to you post-season.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you, Alea. And we'd like just to thank everyone once again for joining us, and we can conclude the call.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nSo just doing some math here. According to your press release, the assisted volumes through the end of the fiscal third quarter were down 10% and you said revenues were flattish. So should we read into that, that pricing is up around 10%? And then, kind of going a step further, in the press release it says that revenues in fiscal '14 have been  $200 million, and then you pushed off $277 million, and the previous year it was $472 million, so that kind of implies a 1% increase? So just trying to understand pricing or fee per return or revenue in general a little better.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, Tom, let me take it and then, Greg can maybe help you with the math. I'll tell the theory. It's very hard to just make a blanket statement like that, but churn's down, pricing up. A lot of this is the component of mix comes into play. So this will be the first of probably 14 times I'm going to say this, we are in halftime of the game, there's a lot of season left to go and really, the full picture will emerge once we have completed the season after April 15. But Greg, you want to do some of the math stuff?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, let me just talk quickly about the return counts. So really, the delta in our perspective is driven really by the Free EZ elimination. And as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, that those are really done at 0 or like minimal to negative value on the bottom line, but on the revenue, it was basically free. So that elimination, a lot of those people have actually are not paying us, so I guess that's the price increase, if you think of it that way, but we just think of it more of just getting rid of the promotional that we've had in the last 3 years. More broadly on pricing, we've outlined to you that we know as an industry, we've got pricing power. That's not lost on us. We go into the season, wanted to be much more strategic in how we handle pricing. We're quite pleased with how we've executed that and we'll be able to talk about that more at the end of the season with you. And also, just closing off this thought with Bill's point, which is mix is a very important part of this conversation, and we have been pleased with our mix thus far in the season.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then going on to pricing, I think a lot of us, and I think you agree that the Affordable Care Act is a big opportunity for you going forward. So just a little curious why you're willing to give up market share now given the level of customer attention ahead of kind of this big opportunity next year and going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes. I think, obviously, well, the intersection of taxes and health care really come into bear in fiscal '15. I think what we're trying to do is get our system ready to serve the clients that we want to serve. We are very focused on this Tax Plus strategy which is having tax returns and attaching our best-in-class financial services product. So I don't look at it as by giving away our service for free, that we've given up a lot from that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just finally, on the bank sale. Great to hear that you still expect to get a deal done by next tax season. But can you just give us an update on how long you think you would take to get a transaction completed to get through all the regulatory requirements and everything?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes. So we remain committed to obviously selling our bank, we remain very much committed to selling world-class management products. Those 2 things aren't changing. We're simply transacting the bank for broader regulatory issues and capital issues related to the additional capital requirements that would be required. And we've been working on this for quite a while, and we actually know a lot about this specific in terms of what we're trying to sell for. As we looked last summer when we made the initial announcement with our previous partner, we'd outlined a timeline that is really announced in July, and we felt comfortable that we'd be able to commercially and operationally get things done at the time felt the regulatory process had enough time to. We had sort of felt that, that would be a mid-October, early November would be really the window that was important for us to hit this tax season. We sit here really halfway through the tax season very much just focused on executing the tax season and running our business. And we continue to believe that getting a solution in place for next tax season is going to happen at this point.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anjaneya Singh (Analysts)】\nThis is Anj Singh dialing in for Hamzah Mazari. I was wondering if you can give us some color, one, on just more if you can be a little bit more explicit on what the attach rates and the metrics looks like on the Emerald Card that you mentioned?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, I think we'll be doing that at the end of the tax season. Again, first half of the season is one part of the game. Well, all that data will be coming forward at the end of the tax season.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nI mean, we spent a lot of time in December describing all the progress the team has made on developing features and functions. We've seen double-digit year-over-year improvement in annual users. As we sort of stand halfway through the season, we're very pleased with executing that strategy. I think it will be a good story at the end of the season.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anjaneya Singh (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then the other question, building on the bank sale question earlier, can you comment on what your view is on what the optimum leverage might look on the balance sheet post you being regulated as a bank holding company?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes. I'll go back to what Greg said, and then, Greg, if you want to comment on this specifically. Right now, we have 2 major priorities in the company, one is to put together a great tax season, and we are hopeful that, that will happen and we feel good about where we're at. And two is to get a transaction done, so that we do execute the goal that Greg outlined earlier that we'll have a bank partner by the -- by tax -- next year's tax season. That's where we're completely focused on. We are having discussions, obviously, about other elements of our business, but we're not prepared at this time to have any announcements around that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gil Luria (Analysts)】\nI wanted to ask a little bit about what -- now that we are a few months into Affordable Care Act, some of the new rules attached to it, you've been doing some trials in Phoenix, you've been -- you have an interface online for consumers to go buy health insurance. How happy are you with the results so far? Is -- are the online results better? The physical store presence resonating more with your customers? What's the update on those initiatives?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, we're not going to go through specific numbers. Here's what I would say. Obviously, this whole initiative got off to a rocky start. There's now stability at healthcare.gov. I think the White House said today, enrollment will definitely end March 31 next year. We just got word, it's now going to be a 90-day enrollment period between November 15 and February 15. And the reason why I'm starting to answer your question in this way is, this is such a fluid situation. What I'm most pleased about is the fact that we are in the game, we are learning, we are talking to clients, we are seeing what matters,  we're trying to reduce confusion. It is still a very hazy initiative for a number of clients. I think this is going to help us. I think we've pointed out in the Analyst Day presentation, there are 46 changes to the tax code associated with this initiative. So by being in the middle of this both for the DIY product and a direct-assisted product, we have learned an awful lot, and that really was the goal for this year. We had signaled that there would be an EPS hit of, I think, it was $0.03 to $0.04, Greg. And that -- really, that was part of the cost of getting the website up to speed, getting the offices in Phoenix ready, and really just being prepared to learn in this business. I don't know if you have anything to add in that, Greg.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nNo, just an observation, Gil, to share with you. So we've outlined in December, I think, a fairly detailed explanation of why we think this is an exciting opportunity for the tax preparation industry. And now that we're halfway through the tax season, we have spent a lot of time at our competitors' locations, we've been spending a lot of time looking at the competitive offerings online. And it's our belief that the amount of investment, thought leadership that Block has done is disproportionately large than the entire rest of the industry combined, and that will benefit us as we think about next season. And I guess, I will also say that we've overinvested this year and it's highly likely we'll be over investing next year because we continue to believe this is a good opportunity for Block.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gil Luria (Analysts)】\nHow about the ability to charge directly for some of this? The IRS is likely to have a form next year and you charge per form. In Massachusetts, we're hearing that you're now charging for their health care form around the neighborhood of $5. Is that an indication of your ability to charge for this? Should we think of $5 as the price point? Or is there still work to do in terms of what an additional form would be priced next year at the national level?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, and again, I think I don't mean to, if you will, sidestep your question, but I think we do have to see the form. And I think the issue is, there are other considerations with regard to Massachusetts as we look at this, we really need to see the form, we really need to see how that 1095s are going to rollout, which is what everybody's going to be getting along with their W-2s next year. So all that intersection, we have to figure out. So I wouldn't make any assumptions on the particular price with regard to as we true-up folks next year and assess the impact of tax penalties on people who chose not to take insurance.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nAnd relative to that, for what it's worth, Gil, I'll just mention, so we are charging in Massachusetts and frankly, probably should have done it historically, but part of the reason we're doing that is, I mean, we're incurring work and training time and we're doing value for our clients by that. But of course, there's broader lessons that we're trying to learn. But keep in mind that the Massachusetts form made materially different than what we see from the federal government, and that's what Bill is really trying to get at. We have to wait and see.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nI wanted to get your thoughts on the impact so far this tax season, at least through February, because of no Free 1040EZ. Now how much of that 9% would you say is the result of not offering the preparation of 1040EZ?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nMost of it. We're not going to get in the specifics, but the large, large majority of it is that decision.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nAny thoughts on how much of it is -- I'm assuming it's weather and the Free 1040EZ, or has some of the weather stuff are -- have been made up by now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes. I think the weather stuff and actually, we have a young executive here who actually did a very expensive weather analysis for us, his geospatial work that he did to show the impact of how much snow has impacted literally each of the, I believe, it was 7,100 offices that got hit by snow this year. So we have a very good understanding of what the impact of the weather was. That is obviously starting to abate as the weather hopefully starts to normalize. So I think that weather, obviously, did have an impact. There were days, especially in places like Georgia, where we did 8% of the returns we were supposed to do on that particular day. So I would say that it was, again, a weird start to this season, there was for all retailers in a variety of businesses big impacts from the weather. The great thing about our industry is you have to come file. So I think, and I think we said this in our prepared remarks, everything's starting to normalize now. We've got 40 days and 40 nights left in the tax season, and we're really focused on the big finish here.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nAnd then, Bill, you talked about, obviously, pricing is going to -- or revenues are going to be higher than what return count is going to be. Would you anticipate that in the first half pricing will be better than the second half? Or will it be the same throughout the tax season?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nWhen you say pricing will be better, I assume you mean will be a higher percentage. Obviously, now charging $39 versus $0 last year, that's a monumental price increase that will appear to be. That's why Greg was talking about earlier the mix element of that by not having -- by not giving away our service for free. That is having an impact. So as we get into the second half where we're overlapping the same pricing on something like EZ, you're certainly going to see that start to normalize. In addition to that, and again, I think it's critical that we continue to focus on what is our core strategy and back to what we talked about in Analyst Day, Tax Plus or our ability to attach these financial services products that we are so proud of, that is a big component of our revenue drive. And while we have not given specific indication, I think Greg and I certainly, speaking for the company, feel very good about the way the field and the digital business has responded to attaching products.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nAnd then just one final question, Bill. You talked a little bit about the online business, and I'm just wondering, the share loss you're seeing in the online business, is that strictly because of the pricing initiatives that you talked about, or is there a little bit more to it? Or maybe how you're going about marketing the product this year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nWhy don't I let Jason take a shot at that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nThanks for your question, Kartik. So as Bill mentioned, we have made some changes in our product that require more complex filers to upgrade, and this has led to a significant portion of what we see is why we trail the industry for an online perspective. But what I want to say is that, I'm really pleased with the results of our product redesign. And as I talked about in December, we're in year 1 of a 2-year redesign. And this year, we're seeing better conversion of our clients and a much better job of driving the growth in our average revenue per user. But I think that you have to consider results from a competitive perspective. And what I see is that we're in maturing digital industry. And my main competitor, Intuit, I have a lot of respect for, frankly, have seen our growth in online segment share the last 3 years, and this season, they appear to be using price as a lever to grow volume. And this is likely because they see parity with us from a product perspective, and it's our viewpoint that this isn't sustainable really in the long run. So with that said, there's a lot of season left, so stay tuned.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nI'll start with the bank guys. So it sounds like no update yet, it sounds like you're confident you're on the timetable that you've been discussing recently. Some other guidelines you provide us in the past were that you had the ballpark of 5 or 6 final suitors with whom you were looking. The first question is, have you whittled that down? Are you comfortable in saying, yes, you're the final 1 or 2 right now? And then the second bank question is, you are also comfortable telling us not too far back that we should continue to think once a partnership's announced that the dilution would be similar to what it was that over public. Do you still feel that those are comfortable guidelines for us to think about as we move forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, so the message is really the same as we've been talking about. We're confident we're going to get this done. Our goals and motivations remain the same. We have wide and varied interests in doing business with Block. I'm really not going to get too much more specific at that point. But I want to make it clear that even though the message has not changed from your perspective, I don't want that to be misinterpreted. There's been a substantial amount of work in the last 3 months from our side, and we continue to feel very comfortable and confident that this will get resolved for next tax season. Now there's always a regulatory angle here that needs to be considered. We learned a lot from that last time, but we should never ignore the fact that there will be regulator approvals that have to go on here, and that, obviously, we're trying to factor into our decisions here. In terms of the form of the actual arrangement when we arrive at it, we'd be really premature to speculate on it what the actual commercial terms would be. But in terms of the general expectation, Scott, we would say we'd be fairly much in the ballpark of what we did with our previous announcement.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nOkay. That's helpful on that. The -- I'm going to shift it over to tax now. Whatever went on our end of the phone is trying to figure out is how at this halftime point are revenues progressing? And Bill, one of your parting -- I think before you turned it over in the prepared remarks to the CFO, you said we are looking to drive, or I don't know if you said, but drive improved top and bottom line result, is that -- are we to take that literally in looking at the full year that you expect improved year-over-year top and bottom line results?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nI think the answer is yes. I don't know, Greg, if you want to give any more...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nNo, I mean, this is very consistent how we've talked about what we believe the opportunity of Block at this industry is you've got core growth every year. In this case, we think it will be 0% to 1% in terms of more returns in the industry. We continue to believe that even for the support in our view from the IRS' release this morning. The second thing is, we know we have pricing power, and that should add another point or two over time, so we sort of believe at Block that getting to 3% to 5% revenue top line is the right starting point for this conversation. That hasn't changed at all here. We, obviously, have come out of several year period where that's not been true, but the trend has been moving in the right direction. We have revenue growth last year for the first time, small growth, but still some growth. And of course, we believe from a fixed cost leverage and focus on expenses and productivity that, that should also have a bigger impact on the bottom line. We've shared with you during today's conversation that we think margins this year, EBITDA margins, will be in line with last year, which will be around 30%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just because a bunch of my peers have obviously asked these questions, and in the same way, you obviously don't want to quantify the price impacts or the revenue impact here at halftime. But I think it's implied and what's being discussed, it will be a net positive by year end is what you're continuing to anticipate. Is -- and I think Tom has asked this, but are you comfortable saying within a couple of hundred basis points, your pricing growth is positive relative to the 9% negative? Or maybe even just talking on the total volume number of 5.6%. Is it fairly comparable at this halftime point, a little ahead, a little behind?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nSo I want to be really clear here that if anyone is believing that price is up 9%, you're mistaken. I think you're really misunderstanding mix and some other sort of factors that will come in here in terms of attach rate and some of the other international things. So I think you really need to be careful when -- in terms of conclusions there. We're not going to go on record in terms of what the price increase is going to be. We'll talk about that more at the end of the season. But we're happy with how we're executing our pricing strategy this year. I think we'll be in much more nuanced this year, much more thoughtful because we're in this business for the long run.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nOkay. And Greg, are you making a rate versus yield comment in that response? Obviously, mix is something that helps revenue per customer go up, but you're saying, hey, rate has not increased 9%, but could, in fact, the revenue per return, probably the bottom line and what people look at, could that still be in the same ballpark? I just want to make sure I understand the message.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nSo my comments are really focused in on the specific price, the net price or the gross price how you think about it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then on marketing, I see that, and I'm just curious if this is a timing issue. It looks like $77 million spent on that line item versus $99 million last year, please correct me if that's correct. But is that you're spending a lot less this year, or is that because of some timing of the third quarter versus the fourth quarter? And a follow-up to that is, how -- are you still -- are you looking to spend the same amount year-over-year? Are you going to get some efficiencies?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nYes, I won't get into specific spending plans but what I will say is, when you have a campaign like we have with the impact it's had, with the great reception that it's gotten from consumers, you can get a lot of bang for the buck, and that's what we've gotten this year. It's a fabulous campaign, awareness is extremely high, all our field leaders are calling into our marketing group and saying, people are walking in the door saying, \"Give me my piece of the $1 billion back.\" It's really been very exciting to see. So whatever the -- if Greg wants to comment on any of the numbers, but really, what we need to do as a marketing-driven organization is really make sure that the impact from the messaging that we do is high, and I think we've certainly achieved that this year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nOkay. If I could add 2 more, 1 for Jason. Jason, a comment from -- I guess, it was from Greg mentioning the new reporting format of the digital category and how that's adjusted out for what you believe could have been fraudulent returns. Could you give us the old -- how it would have been reported otherwise? Or just a way for us to think about that as we compare you to some other industry peers. And any thoughts on perhaps, I know it's a stretch, but if others had adjusted their numbers a similar way, I just want to understand apples-to-apples comparison.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nSo let me, Scott, if I can, just give you a bit more of a mechanical view, and then Jason can give you some broader thoughts. But I mean, the spirit of this is right, which is we're trying to really give you all the best estimate of how many Americans we help to file their taxes. And I think as time's gone on, we have missed that a little bit in some of the definitions, this change was really in the spirit of fixing that problem. It's really -- and when you kind of do the math and, by the way, afterwards if you want to -- anyone wants to call, they can go through the math with you. But in an absolute sense, the numbers have changed, but relatively speaking, they haven't changed at all. The market share gains that we've reported are basically dead on as they were before. But this, I think, is in the spirit of a much cleaner reporting. We do think it has better comparability and, of course, we're able to also spike out this fraud issue, which is a very real issue. And frankly, would be nice to see if some of our competitors recognize that as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nAnd, Scott, the 2 things that we really took out specifically were online free returns that were printed instead of e-filed, and returns that were e-filed but rejected by the IRS, and that makes up the approximately 600,000 reduction from the FY '13 digital return counts. And I just want to make one last point which is that there was no revenue associated with any of these returns that were counted.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nAll right, guys. That's helpful. One more, Bill, for you, if I could. I know that you've had discussions with folks at the Treasury with regard to if there will be a health care form next year, and you touched upon that a little bit today on what would be delivered with the W-2. But as far as the tax form, do you anticipate there will be -- do you -- is there progress on that? Just an update would be great.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, Scott. The only indications we received is that we will see the form, I think, the latest indication we have, this summer. I have certainly indicated in my conversations with the government officials that the sooner you can get that to us, the more I think we can weigh in and give advice. And maybe we'll see -- fresh eyes will see something in that, that has been received. Well -- but we have not -- none of the people in the tax institute or anything have seen the form yet. But we're hopeful that in the next few months, we'll get a peek at it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nFollowing up on some of the -- from many of the questions. Just to make sure, the IRS in counting their online, that's only accepted by the IRS, correct?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nThat's correct, Michael.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nRegarding the billion-dollar marketing campaign, can you give us some ideas how -- what impact that's had? I guess, quantify the impact and the source?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nWell, again, I think I said this, what we track is we track consumer reaction to all the ads we do. Overall, the core message, which we've obviously been very focused on and zeroed in on, for -- this was, I think, 4 weeks into the campaign, it might have been 5 weeks, but we had 3 quarters of all Americans could recite the line. It's part of the consumer vernacular right now. And 90% of the people associated with Block, which for our marketers, sometimes you have a message and you don't know what brand it is. So we've been able to hit on both dimensions which is very exciting for us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nI think I should ask this a little differently. In terms of those coming in who cite the promotion, were they coming from do-it-yourself and coming to assisted? Were they coming from other places? Or were they Block clients who said, boy, I saw this, it was great?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, we don't disclose source of volume. But what I would say is, it's coming from all places in terms of the way this campaign has caught the imagination of America.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nIn connection with, I guess, with the online, the assumption was that this was aimed to be online. And yes, you discussed it -- discussed the numbers, but it just seems that the IRS is 7.5% day-to-day is so much bigger than the number you cite, I guess, on a date-to-date as well. Is there some loss of share in there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nSorry, can you just be clear what the question is, Michael, please?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nSo the IRS number today that was -- self-prepared up 7.5%, and you indicated that you dropped some of nonprofitable business. I was just trying to sort of reconcile numbers, if they're comparable and you reconcile, or if you're gaining share or losing share?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nI'll just point back to Bill's comments as far as our strategy to really go -- to do 2 things this season. One is to look at more complex and high-value clients from a digital perspective and how do we attract those, and then the other to look at our large number of historically free clients and determine how can we create more value. And as he noted and how I also noted in my earlier comment, this decision has led to a significant portion of the delta that you mentioned.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nOkay. Moving on, the -- you indicated a 3% to 5% revenue growth over the long term. If it's not been there, could we expect over the next several years better than 3% to 5% to get -- to average it out?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nSo the 3% of 5% that I outlined earlier doesn't include the ability to take market share, it doesn't include the ability to attach and grow financial services products. As you all know also, our international business is growing at a faster rate. But at this point, let's just get to 3% to 5%, and then we'll talk about what's beyond that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, and this is consistent with what Greg laid out at the Investor Day. This is, as he puts it, what we should expect over the long term, and we're certainly not talking about anything specifically about this year. We'll play the season out and then we'll be reporting to you post-season.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you, Alea. And we'd like just to thank everyone once again for joining us, and we can conclude the call.",

Joining me today are Paul Varga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Jane Morreau, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Fitzgerald, Chief Accounting Officer. \r\nThis morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements, whether due to new information, future events or otherwise. \r\nThis morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. The release can be found on our website under the section titled Investor Relations. In the press release, we have listed a number of the risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K, Form 8-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \r\nDuring this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures and the reasons management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release. \r\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Jane for her prepared remarks.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Jay, and thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. I plan on covering 3 topics today, which should leave us with plenty of time for Q&A after Paul's brief comments: first, I'll review our year-to-date results; second, I'll share some thoughts on what we believe is driving our top-tier performance; and third, I'll discuss our revised outlook for fiscal 2014. \r\nSo let me start with a review of our year-to-date results. We are pleased to report that our underlying net sales grew 8% in the third quarter, slightly above the 7% underlying growth rate registered over the first 9 months of the year. We are encouraged by our ability to deliver strong outperformance in the important O&D period against a backdrop of softer results from many of our competitors. \r\nLet us look at some of our year-to-date growth by geography. Underlying net sales in emerging markets accelerated in the third quarter, lifting our year-to-date growth in these markets from 7% through the second quarter to almost 12% through the third quarter. The majority of our emerging markets enjoyed strong gains, including double-digit growth in China, Brazil, Russia, Thailand, Turkey, India and the former CIS countries. Our results in China have improved significantly through the first 9 months of this fiscal year, driven by our intense focus on diving profitable growth through higher pricing and lower discounting. It is worth mentioning that while our business today in China is relatively small, it has accelerated despite the recent government clampdown on extravagant gift-giving. We believe this is attributable to our portfolio skew to premium rather than luxury price points. Poland also posted double-digit net sales growth year-to-date, reflecting significant volumes at the retail level prior to the January 1 excise tax and price increase. We expect some giveback of Poland's Q3 outperformance in our Q4. \r\nMexico's underlying net sales declined mid single digits in the first 9 months of the fiscal 2014 due to a few factors, including the giveback after significant trade buy-ins late in fiscal 2013, soft economic conditions and a competitive environment for mainstream tequila and RTDs. The softer results in tequila were somewhat offset by continued demand for the Jack Daniel's family of brands. \r\nIn Brown-Forman's non-U.S. developed markets, we delivered 7% year-to-date net sales growth. In Western Europe, underlying net sales increased approximately 10% with strong results in the U.K., Germany and France. On January 1 of this year, we transitioned to our own distribution model in France. We believe that we will be able to translate this investment into long-term growth for our portfolio, our brands, not to mention leverage the cost associated with an owned distribution model as we have done in many markets, such as Germany and Turkey. As expected, the negative impact from this transition and the complete reduction in trade inventory with our previous distributor was $0.06 per share, most of which hit the third quarter. \r\nWe continue to be pleased with our performance in Japan since making our distribution change through Asahi a year ago, as net sales grew double digits. We do, however, anticipate a slower rate of growth in Japan in Q4, as well as the balance of calendar 2014, as we lap the 2013 transition to Asahi. Australia's underlying net sales grew low single digits as the continued combination of a fragile economy and what we believe to be excessive excise tax increases have hampered the country's growth. \r\nIn the United States, year-to-date underlying net sales grew 4%. As has well been documented, brown spirits are outperforming an increasingly competitive vodka category in both volume and value terms, and price mix has become a significant driver of our sales growth. Off-premise trends remain healthy, although on-premise trends appear to have weakened significantly over the last 12 months to the lowest level in almost 5 years. We believe this decline in the on-premise is driven by a number of factors, including a reduction in traffic count, particularly in casual dining; an overall slowdown in consumer spending as consumer confidence has weakened; and persistently high unemployment among the LDA to age 34 group, to name a few. In that last group, instead of drinking in the on-premise, they are drinking in the off-premise as they balance price and value. And of course, one of the worst winters on record has further dampened on-premise sales over the past couple of months. So while our overall on-premise performance in the U.S. is also down, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey is outperforming the top 10 value share brands in that channel. \r\nWith that, let me now move to a discussion of our brands, beginning with the Jack Daniel's trademark. The Jack Daniel's family registered robust underlying net sales growth, up 10% year-to-date. Growth outside of the United States was strong, driven by global demand for authentic, high-quality, American whiskey brands with clear and distinct consumer positioning. We believe that our low market share outside the United States remains a source of tremendous long-term opportunity as we further grow and develop this brand family. The Jack Daniel's trademark grew well in the United States year-to-date, driven by disciplined innovations such as Tennessee Honey. Tennessee Honey grew net sales over 20% despite increasingly challenging comparisons as we approach the brand's fourth year in the U.S. marketplace. Tennessee Honey is now 1 of just 19 special brands to sell over 1 million cases globally at a price point greater than $25, joining none other than Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, which holds the #1 position on that rarefied air list of brands. Collectively, Jack Daniel's Single Barrel and Gentleman Jack grew net sales 12% year-to-date. Jack Daniel's RTDs and RTPs also grew well, up 7% globally with solid contribution from Winter Jack, a seasonal ready-to-pour product that was rolled out into a number of new markets this holiday season, including 30 states in the U.S. \r\nWoodford Reserve's family of brands, which includes Double Oaked, advanced net sales 27% year-to-date. There appears to be continued strong interest in super- and ultra-premium whiskey brands in both the on- and off-premise, and we believe Woodford is well positioned for long-term global growth as one of the pioneers in craft distilling. We aspire to develop Woodford into a million-case brand, given the already sizable business we have today and its current growth trend. \r\nOld Forester grew net sales 13% year-to-date, terrific results from a brand that has been in decline for many years. There is enormous consumer interest in bourbon brands with heritage and authenticity, and Old Forester has both. So we are very excited to see consumers gravitate back towards the first bottled in bond bourbon. \r\nIn vodka, Finlandia's family of brands grew underlying net sales by 9% year-to-date, driven by Russia and Poland. A move to more premium products is helping drive strong results in Russia. However, we believe the vodka category in Poland remains challenging, and we would expect full year rates of growth to moderate given the previously mentioned buy-in, in that market. \r\nIn tequila, Herradura and El Jimador both grew underlying net sales with growth in the United States offset by declines in Mexico, where the tequila category remains extremely competitive. While agave prices have increased, they have not yet translated into better pricing discipline in that marketplace. New Mix RTDs' net sales declined 10% year-to-date, as last year's fourth quarter trade buy-ins negatively impacted the first quarter results. More normal trading patterns have resumed for New Mix as inventories have rebalanced, but the fourth quarter still faces a challenging comparison to last year's buy-in. Southern Comfort's net sales were down mid single digits. These declines were driven by a combination of worsening on-premise trends in the United States and continued pressure in the broader liquors category. \r\nLet me now move to the P&L and reconcile reported to underlying net sales. Year-to-date reported sales grew of 5% was negatively impacted by 1 point due to reductions in trade inventories and by another 1 point due to the strengthening of the dollar, resulting in 7% underlying net sales growth. This top line growth, driven by improvements in price and mix, helped drive a 70-basis-point improvement in our gross margin and a growth in underlying gross profit of 9%. Year-to-date underlying A&P spend increased 8%, 1 point above our underlying net sales growth, as we continue to find new opportunities to invest behind the long-term growth and positioning of our brands through increased media spend on award-winning creative campaigns as well as next-generation advertising. Year-to-date underlying SG&A grew only 2%, helped by some favorable items as well as timing of expenses. We estimate that the normalized rate of SG&A growth would have been over 4% excluding this favorability. So putting this all together, the solid top line growth, margin expansion due to price and mix and operating expense leverage drove underlying operating income growth of 14% or 9% on a reported basis. Given the previously mentioned timing of SG&A, as well as the impact from buy-ins in both Germany and Poland, we estimate these factors boosted our underlying operating income growth through January by about 2 percentage points. Our reported diluted earnings per share for the first 9 months increased 10% to $2.45. \r\nNow moving on to my second topic, I'll share some thoughts on why we believe we are performing at the top tier of the industry. First, we believe we have a terrific portfolio of brands that are skewed towards an increasingly global category, American whiskey. In fact, we have the leading brand, Jack Daniel's, and this trademark represents roughly half of our global volumes. Second, over the past several years, we have divested of lower-growth and lower-margin brands and businesses, such as Hopland wines, Lenox and Hartmann Luggage. This has resulted in a highly focused premium spirits portfolio. In other words, we lack the large tail of low-end brands that some others in our industry have accumulated. Third, we have maintained a disciplined approach towards innovation that has helped fuel growth, such as the success we have driven with Tennessee Honey. And finally, we believe that part of Brown-Forman's outperformance has been driven by a balanced geographic delivery of top line growth. For example, while some competitors were reducing investments in Europe and doubling down in China, we pursued a strategy of balanced investments across all potential markets, developed and emerging, with an eye towards developing superior risk-adjusted returns. So we have been significantly less impacted by the slowdown in some of the emerging markets and have been able to deliver strong market share gains in parts of the developed world, such as Western Europe. \r\nSo we are encouraged by the strength and consistency of our results. While many competitors are increasingly focused on cost cutting, we believe we are in the fortunate position to be able to continue investing in our operations, including but not limited to A&P and SG&A, in an effort to drive long-term sustainable growth. \r\nThis leads me to my third and final topic, an update on our full year outlook for fiscal 2014 and, specifically, a walk-through of what we expect for the fourth quarter. We believe we are on track -- still on track to deliver the high single-digit underlying net sales growth we shared with you since the beginning of the fiscal year, albeit at the low end of the range. We expect our price increases and improved mix will continue to offset inflation on cost of goods and help drive full year gross margin expansion. A&P has been growing ahead of sales, and we expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter. SG&A growth, helped by the previously mentioned favorability, is running a few points behind our full year expectation for mid single-digit growth. This implies Q4's SG&A will be up double digits as favorability unwinds and we incur expenses related to several strategic investments and organizational-related changes. \r\nThese expenses include such things as the buildout of both our sales force in France and the workforce at our new cooperage, not to mention the establishment of our European regional headquarters in Amsterdam. Because these anticipated expenses are occurring later in the year, we expect Q4's underlying operating income growth to be well below what we have achieved year-to-date but keep us on track to deliver our outlook for strong, low double-digit underlying operating income growth for the full fiscal year. Remember that this outlook is on top of last year's impressive 13% growth in underlying operating income. Low double-digit underlying growth in operating income corresponds to an EPS range of $2.95 to $3.05. This EPS range includes a negative $0.06 impact from France as well as a $0.01 hit due to adverse foreign exchange. We expect a full year tax rate of approximately 31%. And to help you model the potential impact from changes in foreign exchange, a 10% move in the dollar in either direction would impact EPS for the balance of the year by approximately $0.04 per share. \r\nIn summary, we are very, very pleased to be reporting such terrific results this morning. This performance is the result of years of investing in our business, and we will continue to invest behind our brands, our people and our production facilities in order to drive the next decade of growth and market outperformance. \r\nSo with that, let the turn the call over to Paul for some of his comments.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I really don't have a lot to add to this morning's release and Jane's very nice summary of our Q3 and year-to-date results. Her detailing of the reasons for our performance relative to our broader industry is, I believe, the main storyline today. We worked very hard over the years to put the company in this position, balancing well, I believe, risk and reward along the way. And today, we, of course, welcome what Jane mentioned, the great momentum that exists for whiskey at premium-and-above price points. And above all, we cherish the opportunity to continue developing the Jack Daniel's trademark around the world as our foremost opportunity in premium whiskey. \r\nI mean, just in summary, we're in a great place today, and we very much look forward to what lies ahead. Before we take your questions, let me finish by congratulating our employees on our continued excellent results and on the comprehensive quality of the results that we announced today. They cannot happen without the collective effort that we observe each and every day across our company, so let me simply say, well done, everyone. \r\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. And now we're happy to take any questions you might have.",

      "transcript_text3": "This is Bill Kirk for Nik Modi. Real quick, you mentioned there'd be some giveback, but have you quantified the 3-2 [ph] magnitude of the Poland buy-in ahead of the excise tax? And is that reflected in the distributor inventory adjustments to calculate underlying net sales and operating income?\n\n---\n\nNik, in terms of your 2 questions, the giveback, the way I would characterize it is the combination of both Poland and Germany buy-in was about 1 point. And so that's what we would expect to shift from third quarter to the fourth quarter in terms of the OI.\n\n---\n\nYes, its impact on OI.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nAnd the impacts are not -- just to clarify something to you, it is not something that in the schedule we always provide that reflects inventory adjustments. This is something that is actually in our underlying operating performance. And so we make note of it, of course, when we think there's -- it's not sustainable in this case because it was related to buy-ins. So we think the impact of OI will be -- was it 2 points specific...\n\n---\n\nIt's 1 point for Poland and Germany and about 1 point for the SG&A timing.\n\n---\n\nOne point for -- that's it.\n\n---\n\nAnd Paul is correct, the inventory -- it's not included in our inventory adjustment schedule.\n\n---\n\nOkay, perfect. And then real quick on Winter Jack. It's branded as a seasonal offering, but given its success and the success of the cider category on a larger basis, are you considering allowing it or something like it to become a more year-round offering?\n\n---\n\nWe're looking at it. We've only had 2 passes at it so far, with the first one in Germany, and it was very seasonal. I mean, it was as intended. And then in the United States, we expanded it this year after just a couple of initial markets, and really, we're encouraged by what we saw. So we're -- like we always do, we're -- with any Jack Daniel's line extension, we always err on the side of caution and conservatism. And so we're taking a look at it. But we're aware of the appeal of that flavor profile and those offerings, particularly in the U.S. market these days.\n\n---\n\nPaul, just wanted to get some perspective on the pricing environment in the U.S. I think in the brown spirits, pricing still seems to be pretty healthy here. So just wanted to get your view on that and kind of the opportunity to take further pricing going forward. Also, just in terms of the on-premise, still somewhat soft for the industry as a whole. How does that kind of factor in, in terms of thinking about pricing?\n\n---\n\nWell, Judy, I think the first part is, yes, we would agree with you. I mean, I think it is a tale really of maybe 2 categories, if you were thinking brown spirits versus white. It does appear that through the holiday period, particularly, that the combination of trade-up to ultra-premium price points within the category is offering a form of a price increase. But then also, within the trademarks, you can see continued evidence of pricing going up. Less so, of course, particularly in the hotly competitive vodka market and in some of the other categories. So -- but we think that potential continues to exist. I mean, you do -- as we go into maybe, what is this now, going to be the third year, we continue to look at cumulative impact as well as the individual impact. And remember, too, for our most significant interests in this area, being the Jack Daniel's trademark, it was not just for financial reasons or trying to cover costs and those sorts of things that we took pricing. I mean, very prevalent in our thinking all along has been continuing to price Jack Daniel's at the ultra-premium levels that we believe it should be around the world, particularly as these segments above the Jack Daniel's price point, which we, of course, compete in, but so do others, continue to develop and expand pretty rapidly. So we, of course, just don't want Jack Daniel's to be seen as a mid-priced or popular-priced brand. So there are some strategic reasons for us to continue to explore that. We're, at this -- always on this call, when we get questions, we're always amidst our planning and budgeting for next fiscal year. So we'll be taking a look at what the specific details are around pricing going forward. But it certainly is our hope that with the category momentum and some other factors out there, we'll be sensitive to the economies that we encounter around the world. But we like the category momentum, and that should encourage us to continue to take pricing where we can get it. So -- and then on the on-premise, I think you had a question about just what does that mean for pricing. Well, I mean, I think Jane mentioned this, you want to be sensitive to it. It's a weak and weaker environment versus the off-premise right now. So you've got to exercise some caution there. And I also would note that one of the reasons we think the on-premise is a little soft is because of the value equation associated with drinking off-premise relative to on-, so -- and actually, the gaps can be pretty large there depending upon where you frequent. And I do think that, that is a contributing factor and does influence the way a lot of the companies might be thinking about pricing. It is, during normal times, I think, a bit easier to pass through price increases when the price is by the drink versus the bottle. But that environment has been kind of soft now for a while. And I just haven't seen as aggressive a set of activities around pricing in that area as we have in the off-premise. So we'll take a look at that as well as we go through our planning this year, but I don't have any sort of new news to report on that.\n\n---\n\nI might just build on what Paul said, just to note a couple of our brands in the on-premise and how they're performing very, very well.  And that is Woodford Reserve, which we also talked about in this call, and our vision to get it to 1 million cases, as well as Tennessee Honey. Both of those brands are performing very well in the on-premise.\n\n---\n\nYes, and it picked up in recent months, too, so...\n\n---\n\nGot it. Okay. And then just on China, so, Jane, you talked about the acceleration you've seen in that market. If you can quantify just how much China was up in the third quarter and then some of the changes that you've made there. I think you had talked about changing some of the pricing strategy there. But anything to sort of note in terms of what is driving sort of that acceleration in that market, which arguably has been more challenging for some of your competitors?\n\n---\n\nYes. So China, of course, is a low base for us, and it was up double digits in the quarter. We've done a number of things over the past year as it relates -- past couple of years as it relates to that market in terms of how we go to market: our people there, the structure, the pricing, the discounting. It's a whole host of new things that we're doing there. And again, it's a small market for it. We're very, very excited about what we've been seeing in the momentum and we're starting to see, and again, like I said, it's up double digits for the quarter.\n\n---\n\nYes, Paul, Jane, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, you kept seeing run rate as you had in the first 6 months, the 30%, and I think you have -- looks like you expected that to slow down a little bit in the second half. I mean, what's happened here? Is this renewed growth in the U.S. or was it new markets? Why are you managing to keep that growth rate going so strongly?\n\n---\n\nI think a balance of all of them, Ian. We -- some of the influence to this is staging kind of the win we roll out in markets. If you go all the way back to the beginning, we started in the United States and we could track quite easily where and when we were introducing it and then as we've expanded it more globally, and it's been pretty staged. Not everyone, as was our tradition in the earlier parts of the rollout, introduced in the first 3 to 4 months of the fiscal year, our fiscal year. So actually, we had some introductions occurring here after even the end of October, just so there's some Q3 introductions that contributed to that. And I'd say just the U.S. has continued to hold up well. I mean, it's on slightly lower growth rates off the higher base. But compared to some of the things we would have been concerned about, when you get these products that do very, very well at the intro, you always have a lurking concern about whether they're going to be too trendy and drop off when they start to cycle against their early successes. And this one, we've been very pleased on 2 levels: one, that it's continued to grow off of its expanding base, and I think a big part of that is it's strong in new consumers; and the other one is just the minimal amounts of cannibalization that we would've observed as it relates to Jack Daniel's Black Label. I mean, those are the always critical tests for a new product in its first few years. And then, yes, of course, we continue -- we don't have as much experience in the markets outside the United States yet. We've got 1 year or 2 with some of them, and the competitive environment is different out there. But so far, so good. I mean, this brand, I think, during the quarter, passed 1 million cases. Jane referenced it. That's sort of rare space for brands that are $25 and above. So, so far, so good on it. And as we do our plans for F '15, we'll be looking closely at those expectations. And in the summer, when we can report full year, we'll update you guys, perhaps, on it.\n\n---\n\nI think just on a full -- I mean, on the tax rate, Jane, you've given us the 31% for this year. I mean, that's slightly lower probably than we've been thinking. Is that a sustainable level as the business becomes more international? Should we be expecting a slightly lower overall tax rate?\n\n---\n\nYes, so just for the year, I will say -- and for the quarter, we had a couple of discrete items that went through. So it is lower than we would normally expect ongoing. But I would just step back for a moment and think about our tax rate in general. And we're a U.S.-based company. We have a single -- our flagship brand that has a single point of production that's in the U.S. as well. And as you know, the U.S. has one of the highest tax -- corporate tax rates around. But to your point, as we do get more global, and we've been seeing this over the past several years, we get -- our business expands, so 60% of our revenues were outside of the U.S. last year, 40% in the U.S, we do expect the tax rate to come down slowly. With that being said, we're always actively looking for legitimate ways to have a more efficient tax rate, and we're very proactive in that space.\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, I think your question -- the best aid to this, if you really think over the long term, in the next 10 years is the international development of the business, which thankfully, for us, has been the main story for a long time, and so we'll continue to look for opportunities. We're encouraged by what -- with this, what is I think the key focus on this point is how discrete this item was and these items were in the quarter to take the tax rate down.\n\n---\n\nThis is Sarah Miller on for Bill. I just had a kind of -- can you talk about, number one, the promotional industry environment during the holiday season? What was kind of the level of gifting, and if there was any excessive promotional activity or kind of any commentary about what you saw there?\n\n---\n\nWell, I mean -- and Jane, you can think about it. I mean, we wouldn't have any provocative headlines, I think, in that area. I mean, the holiday period is always competitive. I think one of the things that influences a bit of the discounting and promotional pricing around whiskey these days, particularly in the categories that we pay the most attention to, our supply-demand dynamics that have been sort of well discussed around the world as it relates particularly to Scotch. And I mean, I think I would have observed that the pricing is pretty rational around the world these last couple of years, probably as a result of that. Because, I mean, if their supplies are precious, they don't want to be giving away the product at prices that is just inappropriate. So I think that might have been, in the longer range, is just more general influence for the premium and ultra-premium areas, where we tend to be concentrated. To be quite honest with you, I know in like -- categories like vodka and more standard-priced tequilas and things like that, I mean, it's very competitive. I don't know that I'd say that the prices were lower so much as it was just tougher to get prices to go up.\n\n---\n\nRight. Just building on what Paul said, this is more of a U.S.-only comment, and so that's only a smaller portion of our business as we go forward. But according to the syndicated data that I believe you all receive or see, both in Nielsen and NABCA, over the holiday period, the value actually grew, and so meaning -- implying that with probably less discounting, could be mix in there as well. But if we look at value growth over that period, it was actually -- it picked up a little bit.\n\n---\n\nYes. That's about what we have to say on that...\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then I know we talked a lot about A&P and SG&A. Do you have any additional color you can add on kind of the gross margin side of what you expect going forward? Is pricing going to boost that in the fourth quarter? Or is that going to be offset by kind of FX moves and that kind of stuff?\n\n---\n\nSo you've seen, and as we talked this morning, that our gross margin expanded about 70 basis points year-to-date. And you also probably saw that in the quarter, we didn't get as much. I think we were basically flat on our margins. And so one reason for that was the mix of our sales that we had in the quarter. We talked about the buy-in, in Poland. And it was with -- largely with Finlandia, which is -- has a lower margin for us in our business. So if I think ahead to our fourth quarter, we still believe, our full year, we will have nice gross margin expansion. Sales will still exceed our cost of goods and inflationary increase. But I would think that would imply that our gross margin in the fourth quarter, because of some of that giveback, should have some improving trends.\n\n---\n\nYes. A nice thing I always look at that could help you with thinking about this longer term, and we'll update this, of course, when we get out to the full year results, is just the supplemental information we provide in the earnings release on Page 11. If you just look at the relationship as you go down the page between net sales gross profit and then down to operating income and look at last year as a full year and our first 9 months to date, I mean, it's evident the sort of operating leverage that the company has been able to accomplish just in these last -- what that would be 21 months. And we're always looking at that to see what's the appropriate level of it. But we're pleased that we were able to get some leverage, and it exists between both sales and gross profit and then between gross profit down to the operating income line. And so -- and we feel like we're investing well behind the business, too. Jane outlined that as it related to the capital investments, too, that we're making to -- which will help us 10 years from now and beyond, but then also the things that we need -- feel we need to do over the next sort of 12 to 36 months related to A&P and SG&A. So it's a great story, I think, for the company right now, and we always scrub this pretty hard during our planning process. And then, again, we'll update that with you here in this, I guess, early June.\n\n---\n\nYes. I guess a longer-term question on the U.S. and millennials. Could you update us on what kind of behavior you're seeing among millennials in the North American whiskey segment, to what extent it's mixing versus straight consumption? My bias is to think that if it's more mixing, that's favorable for the longer-term outlook for the category. And then what also does your research show about their behavior as they age, behavior in the larger spirits segment? Again, you're obviously making some optimistic and, I think, reasonable assumptions as you look out 4 or 5 years for product coming out of the barrel. So just wanted to get an update on what you're seeing from the millennials that kind of undergirds that optimism?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think that -- and maybe a couple of things I'd comment on there. Typically, you'll find early 20s sort of legal drinking age and up, say, to the mid 20s, maybe even into the late 20s, you will see a mix component to it. It's the initial trial stage. And interestingly, at least from my vantage point, is that the mixers actually change with the passage of time, too. I mean, it's just -- all of us who grew up in the industry would have these references to Jack and Coke and all the -- a lot of the leading brands that would be mixed with sodas, and there's, of course, the traditional ones of tonics and things like that. But I mean, all the new ways in which products are prepared and there's such -- and one of the great aspects of this booming bourbon business is the ownership of the account in creating the cocktails they're creating that make it delicious for a consumer to drink bourbon. So some of it's been classic cocktails, but also variations of old classic cocktails that -- I mean, I just saw somewhere the other day just a Peach Manhattan for Woodford Reserve, which you'd think -- I mean, if you think about it, that sounds odd, but how drinkable? It was just outstanding. And so this whole mixability component of American whiskey is perhaps one of the most important aspects of its long-term growth. I think you were sort of inferring that, that it -- the ability to enjoy it in a variety of ways and to, actually, to dilute the product so that it's not exclusively a straight consumption or a shot consumption is a real helpful aspect of what we think has been going on. People do tend to evolve. Even if they stay with the brand, we've noticed from Jack Daniel's over the years that they will evolve the way they consume it. Some will stick with the tried and true way they first experienced it, but other people will evolve toward sometimes more straight consumption or different types of mixers. I think one of the most interesting aspects of what's going on with the millennials and whiskey, and it actually, I think, could be influencing on-premise today, is the social media aspect. And if you think about it, if you're challenged from the standpoint of disposable income but you still want to gather, but you can't afford to go hang out and drink in the bar, you end up creating the bar maybe at home. And social media is a great partnership to that exercise for the consumer. They can mobilize people and be with other people and connect with other people in a way to assemble each other. Sometimes it's called mobbing or hoarding, and I've heard all kinds of interesting terms for the way that millennials and others are gathering. And so that could have a contributing factor to some of the softness that you might see in the on-premise. I mean, I don't have any data to prove that. But just observationally, it seems correct to think that people with access to technology and communications and the ability to bring each other together in different ways than always relying on the bar to do that for them will create new ways to enjoy the products. And of course, that might be part of the reason they're fueling the off-premise consumption relative to the on-. So I think there's a lot of things, some of which we don't quite fully understand and know yet but, of course, we welcome as it relates to our business. But I do think this mixability factor that you were hinting at there is a huge factor in the consumption of American whiskey today.\n\n---\n\nThat's great. And well, as an aside, not that she's drinking age yet, but our 15-year-old was telling my wife and I last night how passé Facebook is, which we're active on. So I'm sure you're much more active than Facebook. But kind of second follow-up is, product coming out of the barrel 4 or 5 years from now, this mixability seems to be a very good reason for optimism in terms of the growth you're planning out there. What do you see that is giving you confidence that as these millennials, of course, aging, we're getting near that point where they're not going to be the contributor to the LDA growth that they've been. What are you seeing that says, okay, they're going to be staying in North American whiskey versus shifting? Is it again this mixability thing?\n\n---\n\nI think mixability relative to, say, even other whiskeys that we see -- I mean, we think even within whiskey, mixability's a -- I do think -- and look, we're all -- we would all be speculating about how long-running the contributing factor of, say, authenticity is. I mean, many of us at the company are regularly talking right now, even in public forums, I just did one here locally a few weeks ago, where you are challenged to think about why is urban and American whiskey doing what it's doing right now, and how sustainable is it and how might you think about it. I think, at the core of it, it's tied up in all kinds of factors related not only to mixability, but also very much -- and I think American whiskey, particularly, hits the sweet spot that's sort of the best attributes of what Scotch provides in terms of premiumness and authenticity and all these other things and all of the great attributes that vodka provides. And I just -- I mean, those are the 2 world's largest categories. And so here's -- American whiskey sits poised to benefit from being at the intersection of the favorable attributes of the 2 of them. Also, I think, don't underestimate things like the hospitality and the realness and the ability to promote and do public relations because you actually have a real place where people can go and visit and meet the manufacturing, the people who make it. They can understand more about the product and deepen their knowledge. And just as a reference point, that's far less a tradition in, say, vodka, whereas it just deepens the sense of commitment and emotion and also the value equation that consumers will then associate with it. So it's kind of bourbon's time right now. We've been waiting for it, to be quite honest with you, for a long time and are happy to have it. But I -- could I forecast 10 years out or even -- but it's -- we know that these forecasts are required because we have to make the product so far in advance. I do say, one of the things that's a nice self-regulating mechanism, it's really interesting, because you're level-headed -- all of us, I hope, are level-headed as we plan 5 and 7 and 10 years out into the future, you do this. You can't have the explosive growth because you won't have the product that creates the trendiness that makes the business go away. So I mean, it's almost like a self-regulating mechanism in whiskey that is you sit there while you could -- maybe could be growing at, I don't know, 9 and you can only grow at 7 or something, you're frustrated. But maybe that 7 goes for a lot longer because you didn't get the 9. And in such a way that I think for years, I think, bourbon manufacturers have had to think about this business.\n\n---\n\nThat's great. Very helpful. We'll try to self-regulate with our numbers as well.\n\n---\n\nAll right.\n\n---\n\nA couple of -- just a couple of housekeeping questions, and then I've got a, I guess, a little bit longer one or larger one for Paul. Jane, just -- have you given CapEx assumption for the full year?\n\n---\n\nWe have a CapEx -- well, I should revise it. I think, before, we had given a $140 million to $160 million range. I think it's going to be more in the $120 million to $140 million range. That money will end up being what we were projecting this year to be spent, being a little bit less, is actually just going to be shifted into next year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So just a timing thing in terms of projects?\n\n---\n\nIt's a timing issue. Absolutely. It's just the timing.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then the -- just the impact of the French -- the distributor inventory changes in France in the fourth quarter, have you talked at all about just kind of quantifying how we should think about that in the fourth quarter if there's an effect at all?\n\n---\n\nYes. Brian, all the hit from the distributor inventory and from the changeover happened through year-to-date January, so we don't expect any more at this point in time.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So fourth quarter is clear of that?\n\n---\n\nIt should be clean...\n\n---\n\nOn the inventory.\n\n---\n\nI mean, on the...\n\n---\n\nNot on the SG&A.\n\n---\n\nAnd not on SG&A. That's fair, Paul.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just on the kind of the lumpiness in the way that SG&A has come in, so it's going to be higher in the fourth quarter. So is that, again, just a timing thing, first? And then, second, is SG&A, I guess, going to come in for the full year higher or lower or in-line than where you were originally planning?\n\n---\n\nSo I'll do this. I mean, let me think about this SG&A thing. First of all, it is lumpy, and we're around 2% underlying right now. I think we've done a really good job thus far balancing the investment in our business with containing cost. But as I said in my script, we're projecting, if we take out all the benefits that we've had and timing through the first 9 months, we're running probably a little bit over 4% on what we call a normalized basis. So when you look at the fourth quarter, it is going to be up double digits. We do not expect that going forward to next year. It's highly unusual. Some of the things that I mentioned, let's talk about, first of all, the cooperage as an example. That's -- we're very excited. We're going to have our new cooperage open in Decatur, Alabama for full production here in a matter of weeks. And those costs that are going to hit the fourth quarter are onetime in nature, so they won't be repeatable. I've mentioned the European office, the regional office. That's part this year, part next year kind of thing. The France is an ongoing thing. This is the first quarter we will have full expense in it. And we will continue to have it all of next year, of course, and beyond. But comparability for the first 8 months next year will be difficult because we didn't have it in the previous year. So it's a combination of things like that. And so I would not expect, though, what you're seeing in the fourth quarter to be sustainable. We will have -- our numbers are coming pretty close to what we planned for the year, which I think was your last question.\n\n---\n\nYes, okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, Paul, just this one last question. I guess, since Beam was taken out, there's been some speculation and we've certainly fielded a lot of questions about just how Brown-Forman stands in terms of the industry consolidating, would the company be a takeout target. And so I guess, not asking you to answer that directly, but more I just kind of reflected back on the Investor Day in 2012 and the presentation that Garvin Brown had made, where he really laid out the -- how the board thinks about the stock, how the family thinks about it, the ownership in the stock. So can you just talk a little bit about whether anything in that regard has changed and just, overall, how you think Brown-Forman is affected? Or is it not affected at all in terms of some of the consolidation you've seen in the industry?\n\n---\n\nWell, I mean, I'll just start. I mean, gosh, I'm trying to think, Bryan, you might go back further than almost anybody on this call with this conversation. I expect you and I have at some point in this conversation. And actually, I give you that reference solely because I think the story and message has been so consistent over that period of time. And look, and how well served has the company and Brown-Forman been by their continuing commitment to the business. So I mean, I think -- I don't know that I can actually say it any better than Garvin did in New York, what was that, about 15 months ago or so. It was a little over a year ago, I think. And so no, I don't think there's any change in our point of view. I mean, we have -- I mean, I just gave a speech that -- where we used the initials of the company to reemphasize our highest ambition, and that phrase is building forever. And I know Jane was there. There was others. I mean, we continue to have regular strategy conversations. And one of the more recent ones I had, probably, I don't know, 3 or 4 weeks ago, we were heavily focused on 2035. I'll just tell you that as a point. So I mean, we were -- and we were spending a lot of time on what the business might look like and how the world might unfold in front of us. And so if that gives you any insight as to whether or not we're lessening in our commitment or perspective about that, I think that's probably one good example as to how we field that. And I'll tell you, I think it's really interesting to -- I mean, of course, you correctly reflected on all the attention, which is, of course, observing what people are writing or speculating about. But for us, it's not -- I mean, it's really not speculating. I mean, we know what we're trying to do, and we welcome the momentum that exists right now in the industry. And we think, also, we're just so well positioned, as you would have observed over the years, to own Jack Daniel's and to be able to take it around the world with what we consider to be still relatively modest shares in the markets and against the categories that we measure ourselves. So we think there's just so much runway still for the company. And so in any event, I mean, I don't really feel like there's any update to that point of view, other than things have been strengthening here at the company.\n\n---\n\nPaul, in the past you've talked about the on-premise as a leading indicator for the business as a whole and that it would -- changes in the on-premise could potentially drive your mix of marketing from push to pull and that it was really something to focus on. Do you think -- obviously, some of the on-premise weakness is the weather, some of it is the economy. Maybe you can talk about the mix there, number one. Number two, refresh us on the percentage of your business in the U.S. that's on-premise and off-. And then, perhaps most importantly, do you think that the changing patterns of consumptions of millennials, for perhaps a variety of reasons, to drink more at home anyhow, perhaps invalidates the importance of on-premise changes as a leading indicator for the rest of the business?\n\n---\n\nOkay, good questions. I think in the past, when I've spoken about the on-premise, I always felt this was just philosophical. But if you could succeed as a brand in the on-premise, it was just the -- it was the ultimate test to have a consumer go in and call, usually in a noisy place, pay more than they would if they were drinking at home and, at the decision point, know how to drink it and, oftentimes, as is the case, like the brand so much you're willing to buy one for another person. I mean, these were great tests, I always felt, of brand appeal and the connection between a brand and a consumer. And so it's less of a shopping experience, is the way to think about it. It's just so instantaneous. And so brand strength, I always felt, was measured there. I think your point is, I sort of was referring to some of this in response to an earlier question, is it's probably time to think about a new [indiscernible] for many of these markets around the world, what the implications are for the on-premise. I would not go so far to say that the on-premise doesn't remain probably perhaps the greatest brand-building environment for distilled spirits and a great differentiator of our industry relative to most packaged goods. I think your question and some of the things we would have been thinking about are good reminders of how does things evolve based on whether it's millennials and new consumers and the way they interact with each other, what does technology impart upon the channel, going back and thinking about pricing. I mean, there was a great question earlier about that. I think all those things are put in the mix, and we haven't done a proper strategic consideration of that. And let's be honest, I mean, it changes market by market by market. You probably should do one for maybe U.S. and maybe more developed Western international markets, would be one cut. Some of these markets around the world, particularly the emerging markets where things are sold by the bottle and food is often consumed, that's a totally different consumption occasion. And so you want to break it into its component parts. But I think it's a fair question for all of us to be asking ourselves, is are we at the beginning of something where the -- it's evolving in the way that the consumer behavior is such that it might influence the business. And I wouldn't have a definitive answer to it, but I think it's a fair question to be asking of us and the entire industry.\n\n---\n\nAnd can -- so can you remind us, just in the U.S., what your mix in terms of volume is, on-premise and off-? And then what I'm kind of hearing from you is that the on-premise weakness that you referred to, maybe it's a source of caution, but it's not a big source of concern as you do your budgeting for next year?\n\n---\n\nI will say it's a source of caution and it's an area of focus, which is not that different to, say, concern. We're trying to evaluate what the best posture is. I know, in more recent months and as we've talked and predicted, and maybe I'll just use the U.S. as an example, I mean, our gang there wants to spend more time and energy and dollars against the on-promise because we're so prominent with Southern Comfort and Jack Daniel's and Tennessee Honey and Woodford. And it is a -- it is not as easy to go and as efficient from a personnel standpoint to cover the many, many, many outlets that exist in on-premise as it is, say, going to a big chain or something. So you have to be thoughtful about how you do it. But no, it's an area of, I mean, concern, I would say. I mean, there's a lot of conversation going on at our company about what's going on with the on-premise and how do we support it, what can we do. I mean, the greatest thing you can do is have the consumers just blissfully walking into the accounts asking for your brands. That's the greatest event. And -- but short of that, there's always a bit of a push component and a need to promote in the on-premise. And so our teams are looking at the best ways to do that. We'll continue to think about it, though. I think these questions you all have raised today about the on-premise are fair. They're fair, and we are continuing to think about it. I don't think, what I've seen so far in our own data, that it's cause for some significant, what I would call in many cases, overreactions or a rash move and reallocation of resources between the 2. I think we'll be more thoughtful about it. And then on your question about how -- what percentage of our business, of course it varies by brand. But just to give you a really developed, well -- a brand in the United States generally might, even if it has very strong call, is going to be more like a 25% to 35% on-premise, and the other part off-premise. I mean, and that would be for the big brands. I mean, you can get these really hot on-premise shop brands, and they'll be 80% on-premise. But for Jack, I don't have the data in front of me, but it's something more like a 20% to 25%. And I think Southern Comfort might be in about that range, something like that, because the business continues, from a distilled spirits basis overall, to be more skewed to the off-premise.\n\n---\n\nJust one quick one on share repurchase, I guess. Looks like you guys didn't buy back stock in the quarter. Is that just being more opportunistic around the stock price? Are there maybe more compelling M&A opportunities out there that you're looking at? Just trying to get a sense of sort of what your appetite might be for share repurchase at these levels versus other uses of cash.\n\n---\n\nJane, do you want to take it?\n\n---\n\nYes, Nic, that's a good question. I just thought I would take us up a level, first of all, and just remind everybody how we look at our capital allocation decisions, and we always look at them over a long-term horizon, generally 10 years. And we really think that has served the company well, served the shareholders very well because it allowed us to be very flexible in our approach, because we're always looking for the opportunity to -- how best to create long-term value for our shareholders. So as you know, what we do is we first go through our list. Our first priority is to always find opportunities to invest behind the organic growth of the business, and we're doing that just now. As you know, we're investing behind a new distillery at Jack Daniel's, the first such major investment since pre-Prohibition. We've got the cooperage that's going to get ready to be opened here soon in Decatur, Alabama. And we're investing heavily behind our Woodford Reserve facility to meet the ambitions that we just talked about in this earnings release of over 1 million cases. We continue to build barrel warehouses so that we have places to put our barrels in to age with the whiskey that we're putting into it, which leads, obviously, to working capital investments that we need to do. So all of those are investments that we do first and foremost. And then we move on our lists, and we want to make sure that we're growing our dividends. And we generally look at growing our dividends in line with our earnings. Once we get past that, we then do look at opportunistic acquisitions, buying back stock and paying special dividends based on our excess cash. And so we do have a share repurchase, and share repurchases are part of our program, as I just said, a part of the equation that we look at. And we have a $250 million share repurchase that will expire this September. We've acquired roughly $50 million so far. I think it's important to note that we've never ever been programmatic, if you will, in our buybacks. So we're not trying to get to a debt-to-EBITDA ratio with these things. And so our buybacks are always subject to what's going on around us in the market and opportunistic purchases and when we can take advantage of it when we pull back and so forth. So we're always constantly reevaluating the best ways to return cash to our shareholders. And we don't -- we do it over a long period of time, not measured by quarters. And that's what I would say.\n\n---\n\nI realize it's still early days, both in France and then looking at the consolidation of the European operations, but can you talk a little bit about sort of the lessons learned as you've brought more distribution in-house over the past couple of years in Europe and how we should think about that as you look at the balance of your business on a global basis? And what are the key takeaways so far as you've really sort of changed your business model in Europe, and what that implies for the rest of the world?\n\n---\n\nThank you for the question. I was over, it was, I guess, maybe 6 weeks ago, for the launch of the French company. So I'll just use that as the example. A bunch of us went over to sort of help get things kicked off. And I mean, it's unbelievable, the amount of excitement. And this was, of course, a unique case. I mean, I don't know -- we got regular questions and observations while we were there about how no one really knew of any other people starting French companies or investing. And the observation sometimes is broader about investing in this way in Europe right now. And so we were sort of against the grain with -- as we were before with Germany, to be quite honest. And so I mean, the primary benefit of this is focus, is the way you might think about it. And when you go from being sold amongst many brands to, in this case for France particularly, where it really is almost to start -- it's starting out, is very much a Jack Daniel's business. Now one of the reasons to do it is so that it can become more than just a Jack Daniel's business as we develop in a very attractive whiskey market. So what happens is, is that you end up having this large group of people who are, I mean, enormously dedicated and incredibly passionate about going out and building something. And that's an intangible you can't measure, you can't put it on the income statement, but that's it. I mean, that to me is the differentiating factor between having an agency relationship and having an owned. And now there are all kinds of unique circumstances as we go up and down the P&L and can describe the cost, and each case is a little bit different. But if you want to know the common theme, whether it was Australia or Turkey or Germany or France, in this case, any of the ones that we've done historically, it's really about getting the people focused on Brown-Forman's work, and in many instances, particularly in the international markets, that's been the Jack Daniel's trademark. And so it's really the word \"focus\" and dedicated effort and enthusiasm that comes from having your own people do the work on your behalf.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Holly, and thanks to all of you for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call. Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any additional questions. Have a great week.\n\n---\n\nThanks, everyone.\n\n---\n\nThank you.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: William Kirk (Analysts)】\nThis is Bill Kirk for Nik Modi. Real quick, you mentioned there'd be some giveback, but have you quantified the 3-2 [ph] magnitude of the Poland buy-in ahead of the excise tax? And is that reflected in the distributor inventory adjustments to calculate underlying net sales and operating income?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nNik, in terms of your 2 questions, the giveback, the way I would characterize it is the combination of both Poland and Germany buy-in was about 1 point. And so that's what we would expect to shift from third quarter to the fourth quarter in terms of the OI.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes, its impact on OI.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nAnd the impacts are not -- just to clarify something to you, it is not something that in the schedule we always provide that reflects inventory adjustments. This is something that is actually in our underlying operating performance. And so we make note of it, of course, when we think there's -- it's not sustainable in this case because it was related to buy-ins. So we think the impact of OI will be -- was it 2 points specific...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nIt's 1 point for Poland and Germany and about 1 point for the SG&A timing.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nOne point for -- that's it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nAnd Paul is correct, the inventory -- it's not included in our inventory adjustment schedule.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Kirk (Analysts)】\nOkay, perfect. And then real quick on Winter Jack. It's branded as a seasonal offering, but given its success and the success of the cider category on a larger basis, are you considering allowing it or something like it to become a more year-round offering?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nWe're looking at it. We've only had 2 passes at it so far, with the first one in Germany, and it was very seasonal. I mean, it was as intended. And then in the United States, we expanded it this year after just a couple of initial markets, and really, we're encouraged by what we saw. So we're -- like we always do, we're -- with any Jack Daniel's line extension, we always err on the side of caution and conservatism. And so we're taking a look at it. But we're aware of the appeal of that flavor profile and those offerings, particularly in the U.S. market these days.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judy Hong (Analysts)】\nPaul, just wanted to get some perspective on the pricing environment in the U.S. I think in the brown spirits, pricing still seems to be pretty healthy here. So just wanted to get your view on that and kind of the opportunity to take further pricing going forward. Also, just in terms of the on-premise, still somewhat soft for the industry as a whole. How does that kind of factor in, in terms of thinking about pricing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nWell, Judy, I think the first part is, yes, we would agree with you. I mean, I think it is a tale really of maybe 2 categories, if you were thinking brown spirits versus white. It does appear that through the holiday period, particularly, that the combination of trade-up to ultra-premium price points within the category is offering a form of a price increase. But then also, within the trademarks, you can see continued evidence of pricing going up. Less so, of course, particularly in the hotly competitive vodka market and in some of the other categories. So -- but we think that potential continues to exist. I mean, you do -- as we go into maybe, what is this now, going to be the third year, we continue to look at cumulative impact as well as the individual impact. And remember, too, for our most significant interests in this area, being the Jack Daniel's trademark, it was not just for financial reasons or trying to cover costs and those sorts of things that we took pricing. I mean, very prevalent in our thinking all along has been continuing to price Jack Daniel's at the ultra-premium levels that we believe it should be around the world, particularly as these segments above the Jack Daniel's price point, which we, of course, compete in, but so do others, continue to develop and expand pretty rapidly. So we, of course, just don't want Jack Daniel's to be seen as a mid-priced or popular-priced brand. So there are some strategic reasons for us to continue to explore that. We're, at this -- always on this call, when we get questions, we're always amidst our planning and budgeting for next fiscal year. So we'll be taking a look at what the specific details are around pricing going forward. But it certainly is our hope that with the category momentum and some other factors out there, we'll be sensitive to the economies that we encounter around the world. But we like the category momentum, and that should encourage us to continue to take pricing where we can get it. So -- and then on the on-premise, I think you had a question about just what does that mean for pricing. Well, I mean, I think Jane mentioned this, you want to be sensitive to it. It's a weak and weaker environment versus the off-premise right now. So you've got to exercise some caution there. And I also would note that one of the reasons we think the on-premise is a little soft is because of the value equation associated with drinking off-premise relative to on-, so -- and actually, the gaps can be pretty large there depending upon where you frequent. And I do think that, that is a contributing factor and does influence the way a lot of the companies might be thinking about pricing. It is, during normal times, I think, a bit easier to pass through price increases when the price is by the drink versus the bottle. But that environment has been kind of soft now for a while. And I just haven't seen as aggressive a set of activities around pricing in that area as we have in the off-premise. So we'll take a look at that as well as we go through our planning this year, but I don't have any sort of new news to report on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nI might just build on what Paul said, just to note a couple of our brands in the on-premise and how they're performing very, very well.  And that is Woodford Reserve, which we also talked about in this call, and our vision to get it to 1 million cases, as well as Tennessee Honey. Both of those brands are performing very well in the on-premise.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes, and it picked up in recent months, too, so...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judy Hong (Analysts)】\nGot it. Okay. And then just on China, so, Jane, you talked about the acceleration you've seen in that market. If you can quantify just how much China was up in the third quarter and then some of the changes that you've made there. I think you had talked about changing some of the pricing strategy there. But anything to sort of note in terms of what is driving sort of that acceleration in that market, which arguably has been more challenging for some of your competitors?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes. So China, of course, is a low base for us, and it was up double digits in the quarter. We've done a number of things over the past year as it relates -- past couple of years as it relates to that market in terms of how we go to market: our people there, the structure, the pricing, the discounting. It's a whole host of new things that we're doing there. And again, it's a small market for it. We're very, very excited about what we've been seeing in the momentum and we're starting to see, and again, like I said, it's up double digits for the quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ian Shackleton (Analysts)】\nYes, Paul, Jane, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, you kept seeing run rate as you had in the first 6 months, the 30%, and I think you have -- looks like you expected that to slow down a little bit in the second half. I mean, what's happened here? Is this renewed growth in the U.S. or was it new markets? Why are you managing to keep that growth rate going so strongly?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nI think a balance of all of them, Ian. We -- some of the influence to this is staging kind of the win we roll out in markets. If you go all the way back to the beginning, we started in the United States and we could track quite easily where and when we were introducing it and then as we've expanded it more globally, and it's been pretty staged. Not everyone, as was our tradition in the earlier parts of the rollout, introduced in the first 3 to 4 months of the fiscal year, our fiscal year. So actually, we had some introductions occurring here after even the end of October, just so there's some Q3 introductions that contributed to that. And I'd say just the U.S. has continued to hold up well. I mean, it's on slightly lower growth rates off the higher base. But compared to some of the things we would have been concerned about, when you get these products that do very, very well at the intro, you always have a lurking concern about whether they're going to be too trendy and drop off when they start to cycle against their early successes. And this one, we've been very pleased on 2 levels: one, that it's continued to grow off of its expanding base, and I think a big part of that is it's strong in new consumers; and the other one is just the minimal amounts of cannibalization that we would've observed as it relates to Jack Daniel's Black Label. I mean, those are the always critical tests for a new product in its first few years. And then, yes, of course, we continue -- we don't have as much experience in the markets outside the United States yet. We've got 1 year or 2 with some of them, and the competitive environment is different out there. But so far, so good. I mean, this brand, I think, during the quarter, passed 1 million cases. Jane referenced it. That's sort of rare space for brands that are $25 and above. So, so far, so good on it. And as we do our plans for F '15, we'll be looking closely at those expectations. And in the summer, when we can report full year, we'll update you guys, perhaps, on it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ian Shackleton (Analysts)】\nI think just on a full -- I mean, on the tax rate, Jane, you've given us the 31% for this year. I mean, that's slightly lower probably than we've been thinking. Is that a sustainable level as the business becomes more international? Should we be expecting a slightly lower overall tax rate?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes, so just for the year, I will say -- and for the quarter, we had a couple of discrete items that went through. So it is lower than we would normally expect ongoing. But I would just step back for a moment and think about our tax rate in general. And we're a U.S.-based company. We have a single -- our flagship brand that has a single point of production that's in the U.S. as well. And as you know, the U.S. has one of the highest tax -- corporate tax rates around. But to your point, as we do get more global, and we've been seeing this over the past several years, we get -- our business expands, so 60% of our revenues were outside of the U.S. last year, 40% in the U.S, we do expect the tax rate to come down slowly. With that being said, we're always actively looking for legitimate ways to have a more efficient tax rate, and we're very proactive in that space.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, I think your question -- the best aid to this, if you really think over the long term, in the next 10 years is the international development of the business, which thankfully, for us, has been the main story for a long time, and so we'll continue to look for opportunities. We're encouraged by what -- with this, what is I think the key focus on this point is how discrete this item was and these items were in the quarter to take the tax rate down.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sarah Miller (Analysts)】\nThis is Sarah Miller on for Bill. I just had a kind of -- can you talk about, number one, the promotional industry environment during the holiday season? What was kind of the level of gifting, and if there was any excessive promotional activity or kind of any commentary about what you saw there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nWell, I mean -- and Jane, you can think about it. I mean, we wouldn't have any provocative headlines, I think, in that area. I mean, the holiday period is always competitive. I think one of the things that influences a bit of the discounting and promotional pricing around whiskey these days, particularly in the categories that we pay the most attention to, our supply-demand dynamics that have been sort of well discussed around the world as it relates particularly to Scotch. And I mean, I think I would have observed that the pricing is pretty rational around the world these last couple of years, probably as a result of that. Because, I mean, if their supplies are precious, they don't want to be giving away the product at prices that is just inappropriate. So I think that might have been, in the longer range, is just more general influence for the premium and ultra-premium areas, where we tend to be concentrated. To be quite honest with you, I know in like -- categories like vodka and more standard-priced tequilas and things like that, I mean, it's very competitive. I don't know that I'd say that the prices were lower so much as it was just tougher to get prices to go up.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nRight. Just building on what Paul said, this is more of a U.S.-only comment, and so that's only a smaller portion of our business as we go forward. But according to the syndicated data that I believe you all receive or see, both in Nielsen and NABCA, over the holiday period, the value actually grew, and so meaning -- implying that with probably less discounting, could be mix in there as well. But if we look at value growth over that period, it was actually -- it picked up a little bit.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes. That's about what we have to say on that...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sarah Miller (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then I know we talked a lot about A&P and SG&A. Do you have any additional color you can add on kind of the gross margin side of what you expect going forward? Is pricing going to boost that in the fourth quarter? Or is that going to be offset by kind of FX moves and that kind of stuff?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nSo you've seen, and as we talked this morning, that our gross margin expanded about 70 basis points year-to-date. And you also probably saw that in the quarter, we didn't get as much. I think we were basically flat on our margins. And so one reason for that was the mix of our sales that we had in the quarter. We talked about the buy-in, in Poland. And it was with -- largely with Finlandia, which is -- has a lower margin for us in our business. So if I think ahead to our fourth quarter, we still believe, our full year, we will have nice gross margin expansion. Sales will still exceed our cost of goods and inflationary increase. But I would think that would imply that our gross margin in the fourth quarter, because of some of that giveback, should have some improving trends.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes. A nice thing I always look at that could help you with thinking about this longer term, and we'll update this, of course, when we get out to the full year results, is just the supplemental information we provide in the earnings release on Page 11. If you just look at the relationship as you go down the page between net sales gross profit and then down to operating income and look at last year as a full year and our first 9 months to date, I mean, it's evident the sort of operating leverage that the company has been able to accomplish just in these last -- what that would be 21 months. And we're always looking at that to see what's the appropriate level of it. But we're pleased that we were able to get some leverage, and it exists between both sales and gross profit and then between gross profit down to the operating income line. And so -- and we feel like we're investing well behind the business, too. Jane outlined that as it related to the capital investments, too, that we're making to -- which will help us 10 years from now and beyond, but then also the things that we need -- feel we need to do over the next sort of 12 to 36 months related to A&P and SG&A. So it's a great story, I think, for the company right now, and we always scrub this pretty hard during our planning process. And then, again, we'll update that with you here in this, I guess, early June.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Swartzberg (Analysts)】\nYes. I guess a longer-term question on the U.S. and millennials. Could you update us on what kind of behavior you're seeing among millennials in the North American whiskey segment, to what extent it's mixing versus straight consumption? My bias is to think that if it's more mixing, that's favorable for the longer-term outlook for the category. And then what also does your research show about their behavior as they age, behavior in the larger spirits segment? Again, you're obviously making some optimistic and, I think, reasonable assumptions as you look out 4 or 5 years for product coming out of the barrel. So just wanted to get an update on what you're seeing from the millennials that kind of undergirds that optimism?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes. I think that -- and maybe a couple of things I'd comment on there. Typically, you'll find early 20s sort of legal drinking age and up, say, to the mid 20s, maybe even into the late 20s, you will see a mix component to it. It's the initial trial stage. And interestingly, at least from my vantage point, is that the mixers actually change with the passage of time, too. I mean, it's just -- all of us who grew up in the industry would have these references to Jack and Coke and all the -- a lot of the leading brands that would be mixed with sodas, and there's, of course, the traditional ones of tonics and things like that. But I mean, all the new ways in which products are prepared and there's such -- and one of the great aspects of this booming bourbon business is the ownership of the account in creating the cocktails they're creating that make it delicious for a consumer to drink bourbon. So some of it's been classic cocktails, but also variations of old classic cocktails that -- I mean, I just saw somewhere the other day just a Peach Manhattan for Woodford Reserve, which you'd think -- I mean, if you think about it, that sounds odd, but how drinkable? It was just outstanding. And so this whole mixability component of American whiskey is perhaps one of the most important aspects of its long-term growth. I think you were sort of inferring that, that it -- the ability to enjoy it in a variety of ways and to, actually, to dilute the product so that it's not exclusively a straight consumption or a shot consumption is a real helpful aspect of what we think has been going on. People do tend to evolve. Even if they stay with the brand, we've noticed from Jack Daniel's over the years that they will evolve the way they consume it. Some will stick with the tried and true way they first experienced it, but other people will evolve toward sometimes more straight consumption or different types of mixers. I think one of the most interesting aspects of what's going on with the millennials and whiskey, and it actually, I think, could be influencing on-premise today, is the social media aspect. And if you think about it, if you're challenged from the standpoint of disposable income but you still want to gather, but you can't afford to go hang out and drink in the bar, you end up creating the bar maybe at home. And social media is a great partnership to that exercise for the consumer. They can mobilize people and be with other people and connect with other people in a way to assemble each other. Sometimes it's called mobbing or hoarding, and I've heard all kinds of interesting terms for the way that millennials and others are gathering. And so that could have a contributing factor to some of the softness that you might see in the on-premise. I mean, I don't have any data to prove that. But just observationally, it seems correct to think that people with access to technology and communications and the ability to bring each other together in different ways than always relying on the bar to do that for them will create new ways to enjoy the products. And of course, that might be part of the reason they're fueling the off-premise consumption relative to the on-. So I think there's a lot of things, some of which we don't quite fully understand and know yet but, of course, we welcome as it relates to our business. But I do think this mixability factor that you were hinting at there is a huge factor in the consumption of American whiskey today.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Swartzberg (Analysts)】\nThat's great. And well, as an aside, not that she's drinking age yet, but our 15-year-old was telling my wife and I last night how passé Facebook is, which we're active on. So I'm sure you're much more active than Facebook. But kind of second follow-up is, product coming out of the barrel 4 or 5 years from now, this mixability seems to be a very good reason for optimism in terms of the growth you're planning out there. What do you see that is giving you confidence that as these millennials, of course, aging, we're getting near that point where they're not going to be the contributor to the LDA growth that they've been. What are you seeing that says, okay, they're going to be staying in North American whiskey versus shifting? Is it again this mixability thing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nI think mixability relative to, say, even other whiskeys that we see -- I mean, we think even within whiskey, mixability's a -- I do think -- and look, we're all -- we would all be speculating about how long-running the contributing factor of, say, authenticity is. I mean, many of us at the company are regularly talking right now, even in public forums, I just did one here locally a few weeks ago, where you are challenged to think about why is urban and American whiskey doing what it's doing right now, and how sustainable is it and how might you think about it. I think, at the core of it, it's tied up in all kinds of factors related not only to mixability, but also very much -- and I think American whiskey, particularly, hits the sweet spot that's sort of the best attributes of what Scotch provides in terms of premiumness and authenticity and all these other things and all of the great attributes that vodka provides. And I just -- I mean, those are the 2 world's largest categories. And so here's -- American whiskey sits poised to benefit from being at the intersection of the favorable attributes of the 2 of them. Also, I think, don't underestimate things like the hospitality and the realness and the ability to promote and do public relations because you actually have a real place where people can go and visit and meet the manufacturing, the people who make it. They can understand more about the product and deepen their knowledge. And just as a reference point, that's far less a tradition in, say, vodka, whereas it just deepens the sense of commitment and emotion and also the value equation that consumers will then associate with it. So it's kind of bourbon's time right now. We've been waiting for it, to be quite honest with you, for a long time and are happy to have it. But I -- could I forecast 10 years out or even -- but it's -- we know that these forecasts are required because we have to make the product so far in advance. I do say, one of the things that's a nice self-regulating mechanism, it's really interesting, because you're level-headed -- all of us, I hope, are level-headed as we plan 5 and 7 and 10 years out into the future, you do this. You can't have the explosive growth because you won't have the product that creates the trendiness that makes the business go away. So I mean, it's almost like a self-regulating mechanism in whiskey that is you sit there while you could -- maybe could be growing at, I don't know, 9 and you can only grow at 7 or something, you're frustrated. But maybe that 7 goes for a lot longer because you didn't get the 9. And in such a way that I think for years, I think, bourbon manufacturers have had to think about this business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Swartzberg (Analysts)】\nThat's great. Very helpful. We'll try to self-regulate with our numbers as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nAll right.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Spillane (Analysts)】\nA couple of -- just a couple of housekeeping questions, and then I've got a, I guess, a little bit longer one or larger one for Paul. Jane, just -- have you given CapEx assumption for the full year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nWe have a CapEx -- well, I should revise it. I think, before, we had given a $140 million to $160 million range. I think it's going to be more in the $120 million to $140 million range. That money will end up being what we were projecting this year to be spent, being a little bit less, is actually just going to be shifted into next year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Spillane (Analysts)】\nOkay. So just a timing thing in terms of projects?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nIt's a timing issue. Absolutely. It's just the timing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Spillane (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then the -- just the impact of the French -- the distributor inventory changes in France in the fourth quarter, have you talked at all about just kind of quantifying how we should think about that in the fourth quarter if there's an effect at all?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes. Brian, all the hit from the distributor inventory and from the changeover happened through year-to-date January, so we don't expect any more at this point in time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Spillane (Analysts)】\nOkay. So fourth quarter is clear of that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nIt should be clean...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nOn the inventory.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nI mean, on the...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nNot on the SG&A.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nAnd not on SG&A. That's fair, Paul.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Spillane (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just on the kind of the lumpiness in the way that SG&A has come in, so it's going to be higher in the fourth quarter. So is that, again, just a timing thing, first? And then, second, is SG&A, I guess, going to come in for the full year higher or lower or in-line than where you were originally planning?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nSo I'll do this. I mean, let me think about this SG&A thing. First of all, it is lumpy, and we're around 2% underlying right now. I think we've done a really good job thus far balancing the investment in our business with containing cost. But as I said in my script, we're projecting, if we take out all the benefits that we've had and timing through the first 9 months, we're running probably a little bit over 4% on what we call a normalized basis. So when you look at the fourth quarter, it is going to be up double digits. We do not expect that going forward to next year. It's highly unusual. Some of the things that I mentioned, let's talk about, first of all, the cooperage as an example. That's -- we're very excited. We're going to have our new cooperage open in Decatur, Alabama for full production here in a matter of weeks. And those costs that are going to hit the fourth quarter are onetime in nature, so they won't be repeatable. I've mentioned the European office, the regional office. That's part this year, part next year kind of thing. The France is an ongoing thing. This is the first quarter we will have full expense in it. And we will continue to have it all of next year, of course, and beyond. But comparability for the first 8 months next year will be difficult because we didn't have it in the previous year. So it's a combination of things like that. And so I would not expect, though, what you're seeing in the fourth quarter to be sustainable. We will have -- our numbers are coming pretty close to what we planned for the year, which I think was your last question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Spillane (Analysts)】\nYes, okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, Paul, just this one last question. I guess, since Beam was taken out, there's been some speculation and we've certainly fielded a lot of questions about just how Brown-Forman stands in terms of the industry consolidating, would the company be a takeout target. And so I guess, not asking you to answer that directly, but more I just kind of reflected back on the Investor Day in 2012 and the presentation that Garvin Brown had made, where he really laid out the -- how the board thinks about the stock, how the family thinks about it, the ownership in the stock. So can you just talk a little bit about whether anything in that regard has changed and just, overall, how you think Brown-Forman is affected? Or is it not affected at all in terms of some of the consolidation you've seen in the industry?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nWell, I mean, I'll just start. I mean, gosh, I'm trying to think, Bryan, you might go back further than almost anybody on this call with this conversation. I expect you and I have at some point in this conversation. And actually, I give you that reference solely because I think the story and message has been so consistent over that period of time. And look, and how well served has the company and Brown-Forman been by their continuing commitment to the business. So I mean, I think -- I don't know that I can actually say it any better than Garvin did in New York, what was that, about 15 months ago or so. It was a little over a year ago, I think. And so no, I don't think there's any change in our point of view. I mean, we have -- I mean, I just gave a speech that -- where we used the initials of the company to reemphasize our highest ambition, and that phrase is building forever. And I know Jane was there. There was others. I mean, we continue to have regular strategy conversations. And one of the more recent ones I had, probably, I don't know, 3 or 4 weeks ago, we were heavily focused on 2035. I'll just tell you that as a point. So I mean, we were -- and we were spending a lot of time on what the business might look like and how the world might unfold in front of us. And so if that gives you any insight as to whether or not we're lessening in our commitment or perspective about that, I think that's probably one good example as to how we field that. And I'll tell you, I think it's really interesting to -- I mean, of course, you correctly reflected on all the attention, which is, of course, observing what people are writing or speculating about. But for us, it's not -- I mean, it's really not speculating. I mean, we know what we're trying to do, and we welcome the momentum that exists right now in the industry. And we think, also, we're just so well positioned, as you would have observed over the years, to own Jack Daniel's and to be able to take it around the world with what we consider to be still relatively modest shares in the markets and against the categories that we measure ourselves. So we think there's just so much runway still for the company. And so in any event, I mean, I don't really feel like there's any update to that point of view, other than things have been strengthening here at the company.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ottenstein (Analysts)】\nPaul, in the past you've talked about the on-premise as a leading indicator for the business as a whole and that it would -- changes in the on-premise could potentially drive your mix of marketing from push to pull and that it was really something to focus on. Do you think -- obviously, some of the on-premise weakness is the weather, some of it is the economy. Maybe you can talk about the mix there, number one. Number two, refresh us on the percentage of your business in the U.S. that's on-premise and off-. And then, perhaps most importantly, do you think that the changing patterns of consumptions of millennials, for perhaps a variety of reasons, to drink more at home anyhow, perhaps invalidates the importance of on-premise changes as a leading indicator for the rest of the business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nOkay, good questions. I think in the past, when I've spoken about the on-premise, I always felt this was just philosophical. But if you could succeed as a brand in the on-premise, it was just the -- it was the ultimate test to have a consumer go in and call, usually in a noisy place, pay more than they would if they were drinking at home and, at the decision point, know how to drink it and, oftentimes, as is the case, like the brand so much you're willing to buy one for another person. I mean, these were great tests, I always felt, of brand appeal and the connection between a brand and a consumer. And so it's less of a shopping experience, is the way to think about it. It's just so instantaneous. And so brand strength, I always felt, was measured there. I think your point is, I sort of was referring to some of this in response to an earlier question, is it's probably time to think about a new [indiscernible] for many of these markets around the world, what the implications are for the on-premise. I would not go so far to say that the on-premise doesn't remain probably perhaps the greatest brand-building environment for distilled spirits and a great differentiator of our industry relative to most packaged goods. I think your question and some of the things we would have been thinking about are good reminders of how does things evolve based on whether it's millennials and new consumers and the way they interact with each other, what does technology impart upon the channel, going back and thinking about pricing. I mean, there was a great question earlier about that. I think all those things are put in the mix, and we haven't done a proper strategic consideration of that. And let's be honest, I mean, it changes market by market by market. You probably should do one for maybe U.S. and maybe more developed Western international markets, would be one cut. Some of these markets around the world, particularly the emerging markets where things are sold by the bottle and food is often consumed, that's a totally different consumption occasion. And so you want to break it into its component parts. But I think it's a fair question for all of us to be asking ourselves, is are we at the beginning of something where the -- it's evolving in the way that the consumer behavior is such that it might influence the business. And I wouldn't have a definitive answer to it, but I think it's a fair question to be asking of us and the entire industry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ottenstein (Analysts)】\nAnd can -- so can you remind us, just in the U.S., what your mix in terms of volume is, on-premise and off-? And then what I'm kind of hearing from you is that the on-premise weakness that you referred to, maybe it's a source of caution, but it's not a big source of concern as you do your budgeting for next year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nI will say it's a source of caution and it's an area of focus, which is not that different to, say, concern. We're trying to evaluate what the best posture is. I know, in more recent months and as we've talked and predicted, and maybe I'll just use the U.S. as an example, I mean, our gang there wants to spend more time and energy and dollars against the on-promise because we're so prominent with Southern Comfort and Jack Daniel's and Tennessee Honey and Woodford. And it is a -- it is not as easy to go and as efficient from a personnel standpoint to cover the many, many, many outlets that exist in on-premise as it is, say, going to a big chain or something. So you have to be thoughtful about how you do it. But no, it's an area of, I mean, concern, I would say. I mean, there's a lot of conversation going on at our company about what's going on with the on-premise and how do we support it, what can we do. I mean, the greatest thing you can do is have the consumers just blissfully walking into the accounts asking for your brands. That's the greatest event. And -- but short of that, there's always a bit of a push component and a need to promote in the on-premise. And so our teams are looking at the best ways to do that. We'll continue to think about it, though. I think these questions you all have raised today about the on-premise are fair. They're fair, and we are continuing to think about it. I don't think, what I've seen so far in our own data, that it's cause for some significant, what I would call in many cases, overreactions or a rash move and reallocation of resources between the 2. I think we'll be more thoughtful about it. And then on your question about how -- what percentage of our business, of course it varies by brand. But just to give you a really developed, well -- a brand in the United States generally might, even if it has very strong call, is going to be more like a 25% to 35% on-premise, and the other part off-premise. I mean, and that would be for the big brands. I mean, you can get these really hot on-premise shop brands, and they'll be 80% on-premise. But for Jack, I don't have the data in front of me, but it's something more like a 20% to 25%. And I think Southern Comfort might be in about that range, something like that, because the business continues, from a distilled spirits basis overall, to be more skewed to the off-premise.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nicholas Cavallo (Analysts)】\nJust one quick one on share repurchase, I guess. Looks like you guys didn't buy back stock in the quarter. Is that just being more opportunistic around the stock price? Are there maybe more compelling M&A opportunities out there that you're looking at? Just trying to get a sense of sort of what your appetite might be for share repurchase at these levels versus other uses of cash.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nJane, do you want to take it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes, Nic, that's a good question. I just thought I would take us up a level, first of all, and just remind everybody how we look at our capital allocation decisions, and we always look at them over a long-term horizon, generally 10 years. And we really think that has served the company well, served the shareholders very well because it allowed us to be very flexible in our approach, because we're always looking for the opportunity to -- how best to create long-term value for our shareholders. So as you know, what we do is we first go through our list. Our first priority is to always find opportunities to invest behind the organic growth of the business, and we're doing that just now. As you know, we're investing behind a new distillery at Jack Daniel's, the first such major investment since pre-Prohibition. We've got the cooperage that's going to get ready to be opened here soon in Decatur, Alabama. And we're investing heavily behind our Woodford Reserve facility to meet the ambitions that we just talked about in this earnings release of over 1 million cases. We continue to build barrel warehouses so that we have places to put our barrels in to age with the whiskey that we're putting into it, which leads, obviously, to working capital investments that we need to do. So all of those are investments that we do first and foremost. And then we move on our lists, and we want to make sure that we're growing our dividends. And we generally look at growing our dividends in line with our earnings. Once we get past that, we then do look at opportunistic acquisitions, buying back stock and paying special dividends based on our excess cash. And so we do have a share repurchase, and share repurchases are part of our program, as I just said, a part of the equation that we look at. And we have a $250 million share repurchase that will expire this September. We've acquired roughly $50 million so far. I think it's important to note that we've never ever been programmatic, if you will, in our buybacks. So we're not trying to get to a debt-to-EBITDA ratio with these things. And so our buybacks are always subject to what's going on around us in the market and opportunistic purchases and when we can take advantage of it when we pull back and so forth. So we're always constantly reevaluating the best ways to return cash to our shareholders. And we don't -- we do it over a long period of time, not measured by quarters. And that's what I would say.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Faucher (Analysts)】\nI realize it's still early days, both in France and then looking at the consolidation of the European operations, but can you talk a little bit about sort of the lessons learned as you've brought more distribution in-house over the past couple of years in Europe and how we should think about that as you look at the balance of your business on a global basis? And what are the key takeaways so far as you've really sort of changed your business model in Europe, and what that implies for the rest of the world?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nThank you for the question. I was over, it was, I guess, maybe 6 weeks ago, for the launch of the French company. So I'll just use that as the example. A bunch of us went over to sort of help get things kicked off. And I mean, it's unbelievable, the amount of excitement. And this was, of course, a unique case. I mean, I don't know -- we got regular questions and observations while we were there about how no one really knew of any other people starting French companies or investing. And the observation sometimes is broader about investing in this way in Europe right now. And so we were sort of against the grain with -- as we were before with Germany, to be quite honest. And so I mean, the primary benefit of this is focus, is the way you might think about it. And when you go from being sold amongst many brands to, in this case for France particularly, where it really is almost to start -- it's starting out, is very much a Jack Daniel's business. Now one of the reasons to do it is so that it can become more than just a Jack Daniel's business as we develop in a very attractive whiskey market. So what happens is, is that you end up having this large group of people who are, I mean, enormously dedicated and incredibly passionate about going out and building something. And that's an intangible you can't measure, you can't put it on the income statement, but that's it. I mean, that to me is the differentiating factor between having an agency relationship and having an owned. And now there are all kinds of unique circumstances as we go up and down the P&L and can describe the cost, and each case is a little bit different. But if you want to know the common theme, whether it was Australia or Turkey or Germany or France, in this case, any of the ones that we've done historically, it's really about getting the people focused on Brown-Forman's work, and in many instances, particularly in the international markets, that's been the Jack Daniel's trademark. And so it's really the word \"focus\" and dedicated effort and enthusiasm that comes from having your own people do the work on your behalf.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Koval (Executives)】\nThank you, Holly, and thanks to all of you for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call.

The speakers for today's call will be Jim Whitehurst, President and CEO; and Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and CFO.\r\nOur press -- our earnings press release was issued after the market closed today and may be downloaded from redhat.com on the Investor Relations page. Also on this page, you will be able to find historic reconciliation schedule of GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics, as well as a schedule on currency rates.\r\nVarious remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans, prospects, including statements containing the words believe, anticipate, plan, project, estimate, expect, intend or will, constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC, as well as the Safe Harbor statement in today's press release. \r\nIn addition, any forward-looking statements represent our views only as of today, March 27, 2014, and these estimates or views may change.

And therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our estimates or views as any date subsequent to today.\r\nBefore I turn the call over to Jim, I'd like to remind everyone in the investment community to register for our April 16 Analyst Day. The Analyst Day will be held in conjunction with Red Hat Summit. \r\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Whitehurst.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Tom, and let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call. The fourth quarter was a strong finish to fiscal 2014, and it was highlighted by a record number of deals over $1 million and 24% growth in our billings proxy. Fiscal '14 was a great year, during which we produced a record billings proxy, up 17% year-over-year; record annual revenue, up 15% year-over-year; and record total backlog, up 14% year-over-year.\r\nThe main drivers of this growth in Q4 was the continued demand for Red Hat's fast-growing core platform and application development offerings, including our broad portfolio of middleware offerings. In addition, our cross-selling efforts resulted in early wins for our emerging technologies, which address CIOs' top priorities that are driving the evolution of enterprise computing. \r\nThis demand led to closing OpenStack, OpenShift and Red Hat cloud infrastructure deals in all of our major geographies. These deals covered a broad group of the industries, from financial services, technology and media, government agencies, research universities, telecommunications, health care, transportation and retail companies.\r\nAs Charlie will detail later, we expect Red Hat to deliver continued solid growth in FY '15, and we plan to continue investing for the long term, with a particular focus on further commercializing and driving adoption of our emerging technologies in cloud computing and Big Data storage.\r\nOur record quarter for both bookings and billings was driven by strong renewals, further expansion of existing customer relationships, growing traction across multiple offerings, new customer acquisition and broadening of our routes to market. With that overview, let's discuss some of the key customer metrics from our fourth quarter.\r\nLarge deal metrics were very strong this quarter. All of the top 30 deals were greater than $1 million for the third quarter in a row. In fact, we've closed a record number of deals in excess of $1 million with more than 70 in total. The 7 deals that were over $5 million also set a record, and 2 of these were over $10 million. \r\nThe growth in our larger deals is not only one of the drivers of our continued solid growth at Red Hat's current scale, it also is an important validation of Red Hat's growing strategic importance with customers. A record 65% of the top 30 deals included a middleware component with 4 all-middleware deals in the group. Cross-selling was even broader in Q4 where 75% of our top deals had a technology component beyond RHEL, including middleware, RHEV, storage, OpenShift and OpenStack technologies.\r\nTechnology and media and telecom cloud had the highest dollar representation in the top 30 deals. Interesting, looking at the number of deals, instead of the dollars, the number of deals was evenly split across our top 4 verticals: financial services, government, technology and media and telecom [ph] cloud, as well as our group of mainstream customers that include customers in health care, retail and travel, among others.\r\nRenewals are an important opportunity to expand our relationship with customers for our core technologies, as well as emerging ones. This quarter, we renewed 24 out of 25 of our largest deals up for renewal during the quarter and 99 out of 100 deals for the fiscal year. These top deals grew at approximately 120% of their previous annualized value during every quarter this year. \r\nWe also saw a number of customers in the top renewals for the quarter by multiple technologies from us, demonstrating our expanding relationship with our top customers. The one deal that did not renew this quarter is a customer that is competing in a consolidating industry. We are still working with the customer and expect to move forward with the new deal in the future.\r\nNow let me update you on some of the progress we've made in our growth initiatives to offer a cohesive, open hybrid cloud solution for our customers in new markets. Here are a few highlights from the quarter: first, we continued to enhance our core platform and application development offerings. For instance, the RHEL 7 data process is moving smoothly as the technology continues to be further hardened. One of the exciting new features of RHEL 7 is Linux Containers, which has emerged as a noteworthy application packaging and delivering technology, combining lightweight application isolation with the flexibility of image-based deployment methods. \r\nRecently, we announced the extension of our certification program to include containerized applications. The Red Hat Container Certification ensures that application containers built using Red Hat Enterprise Linux will operate seamlessly across certified container hosts.\r\nOn the application development side, we released 8 new versions of our middleware offerings over the past year. This quarter, we -- releases included our application performance enhancing, JBoss Data Grid 6.2 and JBoss Data Virtualization 6 to help enterprises turn Big Data into actionable information. \r\nSecond, we expanded our relationship with the largest public cloud providers to give us additional ways to reach new customers, while also providing existing customers with a certified option to run their applications. In February, we expanded our partnership with Amazon to their AWS GovCloud, so that Red Hat offerings are now available globally across every region of AWS. We also continued to add large public cloud providers, as we welcomed AT&T Cloud Services to our Certified Cloud Provider program in Q4.\r\nThird, in addition to Big Data announcements around JBoss Data Virtualization 6, we also deepened our strategic relationship with the leading contributor and provider of enterprise, Apache Hadoop of Hortonworks. As Hadoop continues to gain traction in enterprise Big Data implementations, we want to make sure that it is tightly integrated into Red Hat's open hybrid cloud technologies, such as RHEL, OpenStack platform, Red Hat JBoss Middleware and Red Hat Storage.\r\nFourth, our progress to commercialize OpenStack continues to advance quickly. We continue to see additional downloads, proof of concepts and deal closings. We are experiencing approximately 3,000 downloads per day, increased commitments to POCs, and we closed dozens of new deals. Most customers are still in the initial deployment phase, but we continue to see 6-figure commitments for larger deployments and we closed our first million-dollar deal.\r\nCross-selling in our top deals was also evident with 3 of the top 5 deals having an OpenStack component, and 2 of these deals had an OpenStack and OpenShift component. We also launched our OpenStack training and professional certification program globally and have already certified hundreds on Red Hat OpenStack, with the goal of ramping that number into thousands very rapidly. Further, we've hired a number of OpenStack engineers, overlaid sales people and consultants that we believe will drive further innovation and adoption of these exciting new technologies.\r\nFifth, we announced new relationships with Alcatel-Lucent and Dell to bring OpenStack-based network function virtualization or NFV to the telecom providers. There's a major shift to the telecom market as these providers look to save both CapEx and OpEx with software-based solutions in their networks. This market for carrier-class technology is new for Red Hat and further expands our addressable market. According to IDC, NFV is the fastest-growing piece of the global telecommunications market and is expected to grow rapidly to more than $1 billion in the next few years.\r\nAs we begin our next fiscal year, we are very optimistic about Red Hat's future. Our infrastructure-related offerings, including our CORE platform, continue to have attractive growth opportunities. And our application-related offerings, including our flagship middleware offering and our portfolio of emerging cloud technologies, are increasingly important contributors to our overall success. We are addressing multiple areas of IT spend that are both significant and strategic, and we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity based on Red Hat's proven ability to deliver business value to our customers over the long term.\r\nBefore turning the call over to Charlie, I want to thank each of our Red Hat associates around the globe for their continued focus on driving innovation, supporting our customers and delivering strong results for our shareholders. \r\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Charlie.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Jim. I'm pleased to report a strong fourth quarter that demonstrates the continued demand of our offerings, spanning operating systems, middleware and emerging technologies. It also reflects strong execution on the part of our people, which resulted in a compelling combination of revenue growth, profitability and cash flow. \r\nHere are just a few financial highlights on a year-over-year basis: first, our billings proxy for Q4 set a new record at $565 million, up 24% year-over-year in U.S. dollars or 26% in constant currency, with strong growth in both short- and long-term deferred revenue. As a reminder, our billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue to the change in deferred revenue shown on the cash flow statement, which Jim highlighted earlier.\r\nQ4 subscription revenue grew 18% in constant currency or 16% in U.S. dollars. Full year subscription revenue was also up 18% in constant currency and 16% in U.S. dollars. Full year non-GAAP operating income grew 15%, and we hit new record highs for both quarterly and annual operating cash flow of $185 million for the quarter, up 35%; and full year operating cash flow of $541 million, up 16%. And free cash flow grew 21% year-over-year, as CapEx has begun to subside as we predicted.\r\nAs I've done on other year-end calls, I'm going to add a few additional statistics about bookings. To be clear, similar to prior years, we will not be updating these booking statistics on a quarterly basis. First, total backlog for the fiscal year was over $1.56 billion, up 14% year-over-year. We define total backlog as total deferred revenue, which is billed, plus the value of customer contracts to be billed in the future not reflected in our financial statements.\r\nThe total deferred revenue portion for the fiscal year was $1.29 billion, up 18% year-over-year. The portion of total backlog to be billed in the future or our off-balance sheet backlog was in excess of $270 million compared to in excess of $280 million last fiscal year. It's important to note that the portion of off-balance sheet backlog to be billed in the next 12 months was in excess of $190 million, up $10 million from fiscal 2013. \r\nThese results reflect the mix of business that include a larger number of renewable, single-year deals and the impact of growing public cloud revenue that is reported in arrears as revenue. The combination of deferred revenue and off-balance sheet backlog to be billed in the next 12 months gives us very good visibility into a significant portion of fiscal year '15 revenue, which I'll discuss in a moment.\r\nMoving on to bookings by channel and geography. Our Q4 bookings mix was 56% from the channel and 44% from direct sales. Similar to past fourth quarters, the higher direct sales percentage in Q4 versus earlier quarters was a result of the increase in large deals, mostly handled by our direct sales teams. For the year, our channel business grew faster than direct sales, resulting in an annual mix of 63% from the channel and 37% direct, up from last fiscal year, and moving closer to our multiyear goal of 70%:30% split of channel and direct sales.\r\nOur geographic split of bookings was 61% from the Americas, 26% from EMEA and 13% from APAC compared to a split in Q4 last year of 63%, 25% and 12%, respectively. All regions performed well.\r\nNow let's talk about our financial performance for the quarter, starting with revenue. Fourth quarter revenue was $400 million, up 15% in U.S. dollars from the prior year and at the top end of our guidance, despite a slight FX headwind from guidance rate. On a constant currency basis, revenue would have been $407 million or up 17% from the prior year.\r\nSubscription revenue, which is a renewable revenue stream, constitute approximately 88% of total revenue in Q4. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $351 million, up 16% in U.S. dollars from the prior year. In constant currency, subscription revenue would have been $356 million or up 18% from the prior year.\r\nTraining and services revenue was $49 million, up 8% in U.S. dollars from the year-ago quarter and was down $5 million sequentially, as we experienced our normal Q4 holiday downtime, which reduces the number of consulting and training delivery days.\r\nNow I'll discuss the rest of the results on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation and amortization expense. Overall, gross margin was 86% for Q4, up 10 basis points sequentially and up 10 basis points from the prior year, due to more subscription revenue in the mix. Subscription gross margin was consistent with last quarter and last year at 94%.\r\nThe training and services gross margin is 32%, 220 basis points lower than Q4 last year, due to the increased hiring of OpenStack consultants and training resources ahead of revenue, as we continue to build our global presence in this technology.\r\nFor Q4, non-GAAP operating expense was $248 million, up 2% sequentially and up 15% in U.S. dollars from the prior year. We added over 180 new employees in the quarter, aggressively hiring sales and engineering associates, including those with skills related to our emerging technologies like OpenStack, as I just mentioned.\r\nFor the fiscal year, we increased our headcount about -- by 14% with greater than 80% of the new associates doing [ph] sales, engineering, services and support. Q4 non-GAAP operating income of $97 million increased 16% from last year, resulting in Q4 non-GAAP operating margin of 24.3%. Net interest income was $2 million, consistent with last year.\r\nOur annual effective tax rate was approximately 26% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results, which is lower than the 27.5% rate, which we had estimated last quarter. This led to a Q4 non-GAAP tax rate, which was 24% in order to adjust to this annual rate.\r\nOur non-GAAP diluted quarterly earnings per share is $0.39 compared to non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.36 in Q4 last year. One should note that in fiscal year 2013 Q4, EPS included a benefit of approximately $0.03 per share from the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit, which is not in this year's Q4 results.\r\nNow let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the year with just under $1.5 billion in cash and investments. For the fiscal year, we repurchased approximately 5 million shares of Red Hat common stock for approximately $239 million. At February 28, the balance remaining on our stock repurchase authorization was approximately $240 million.\r\nOur day sales outstanding improved sequentially and year-over-year and was within our desired range. Satisfied customers tend to pay their bills on time but slightly better linearity in the quarter also helped. DSO was 58 days for Q4 compared to 62 days last quarter and 60 days last year. As a reminder, since days sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables versus billings, our DSO calculation is based on our billings proxy, which includes revenue plus the change in deferred revenue from the cash flow statement.\r\nTotal deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.29 billion, an increase of $199 million or 18% over the prior year-end. Sequentially, deferred revenue increased approximately $166 million from last quarter. \r\nLet me break down the components of deferred revenue for you while factoring in the impact of foreign exchange. Short-term deferred revenue, which ended Q3 at $834 million, had real growth in Q4 of $132 million and increased further just $1 million as a result of changes in the spot rates, ending Q4 at $967 million. \r\nLong-term deferred revenue, which ended Q3 at $290 million, had a real increase in Q4 of approximately $32 million with no material impact as a result of changes in FX spot rates, ending Q4 at $322 million. The total increase in deferred revenue without the impact of currency changes was $164 million, and you can find it on the statement of cash flows.\r\nMoving to the statement of cash flows. We produced a record quarterly operating cash flow of $185 million. That's up 35% year-over-year. Full year operating cash flow was $541 million, up 16% and well above guidance. This overachievement was driven by strong billings and collections and is more remarkable in light of the negative impact to cash flow of the $10 million payment for U.S. taxes, which I mentioned last quarter.\r\nNow to briefly recap and summarize highlights for the full fiscal year. Revenue grew to $1.53 billion, up 17% year-over-year in constant currency or up 15% in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue grew to $1.34 billion, an increase of 18% in constant currency or 16% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP operating margin for the year was 24.5%, 50 basis points higher than initial guidance. That's still allowing for further international expansion and continued investment in emerging technologies.\r\nNon-GAAP operating income grew by 15%. Non-GAAP EPS for the full year was $1.49, up 21% over the prior year. Overall, it was another great year with strong execution.\r\nI now want to shift to fiscal year 2015 guidance. For this guidance, I have assumed average FX rates of $1.37 to the euro and JPY 102 to the dollar. Compared to the year just finished, this represents a 2% strengthening of the euro and a 2% weakening of the yen. Please see our website for other currencies in which we do business.\r\nAs in the past, I'm not attempting to forecast exchange rates. I'm simply taking guidance at this point. So at these foreign exchange rates, we are forecasting total revenue in the range of $1.730 billion to $1.755 billion for fiscal 2015, representing an annual revenue growth rate up to 14% in U.S. dollars. This growth rate assumes that subscription and services revenues will grow at approximately the same rate. We expect services will reaccelerate this year, as training picks up after the introduction of RHEL 7 and consulting for both middleware and OpenStack will continue to grow.\r\nOur operating margin forecast reflects our plan to ramp up investment in emerging technologies and planned launches of core technologies, including RHEL 7. You should expect to see the investment in newer technologies reflected in higher spending in services, support, engineering and sales, which, due to our subscription model, is always ahead of revenue. Based upon our finish to fiscal year 2014 and our current outlook, we are targeting non-GAAP operating margin around 23.5% for the fiscal year 2015, as we continue to invest for growth, particularly around OpenStack.\r\nI'm estimating full year other income, principally net interest income of approximately $8 million or $2 million per quarter. The estimated annual effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 is 29% for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. One of the primary reasons for the rate -- that the rate is higher in fiscal '15 is due to the expiration, once again, of the U.S. R&D tax credit. Assuming a 29% tax rate and approximately 192 million diluted shares, one would estimate diluted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.54 to $1.56 per share.\r\nOn a GAAP basis, we estimate annual stock compensation expense of approximately $135 million and annual amortization expense of approximately $25 million.\r\nFrom a cash flow perspective, we anticipate operating cash flow for the full year between $580 million to $600 million. This assumes approximately 10% cash taxes. We are forecasting CapEx of approximately $50 million, a decrease of almost $30 million from fiscal year '14, which reflects the completion of several major facility expansion projects last year and returning to a more normal run rate. This CapEx reduction is a significant boost to free cash flow, which should grow upwards to 19% this year.\r\nFinally, as we have seen over the last several years, with the recurring revenue model, there's a natural ebb and flow to the business from quarter to quarter. Bookings and billings historically are lowest in Q1, and then they have grown each quarter to the fourth quarter to then repeat the pattern again in the following year. We would expect the same this year. Revenue, on the other hand, has grown every quarter for the last 12 years. \r\nFor Q1, we offer the following guidance: revenue is estimated to be $412 million to $415 million. Non-GAAP operating margin is estimated to be approximately 21%, as a result of the timing this year of the Red Hat Summit in mid-April, the OpenStack summit in May, combined with sales kickoffs and other major marketing events globally and continued hiring in sales and engineering. With interest income of $2 million and a 29% tax rate, non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.32 to $0.33, assuming approximately 192 million diluted shares. \r\nConsistent with my past practice, I do not guide quarterly cash flow because it can be quite variable, depending upon individual large payments or receipts. However, I would say it seems likely that the multiyear pattern of higher cash flow in Q1 than Q2 will repeat, given our strong year-end balance sheet. \r\nIn summary, we are pleased by the strength of our results for fiscal year 2014. We're firmly positioned for further growth and profitability in 2015 and beyond by leveraging emerging technologies that continue to expand our addressable market; larger deals, strong renewals and increasing upsell on our top deals that strengthen our strategic position with customers; a record backlog that provides even better forward visibility; the fastest-growing set of core platform and middleware technologies in the industry; and of course, we have a major product refresh cycle this year.\r\nOn a final note, I hope many of you will be able to join us on April 16 for Analyst Day at the Red Hat Summit in San Francisco. It will be a great opportunity to learn more about our strategy, innovation and customer focus. If you are unable to attend in person, we hope you'll be able to join our live webcast where you'll be able to access all the information that we present.\r\nOperator, I'd now like to turn it back over to you for the first question.",

The Analyst Day will be held in conjunction with Red Hat Summit. \r\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Whitehurst.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nThanks, Tom, and let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call. The fourth quarter was a strong finish to fiscal 2014, and it was highlighted by a record number of deals over $1 million and 24% growth in our billings proxy. Fiscal '14 was a great year, during which we produced a record billings proxy, up 17% year-over-year; record annual revenue, up 15% year-over-year; and record total backlog, up 14% year-over-year.\r\nThe main drivers of this growth in Q4 was the continued demand for Red Hat's fast-growing core platform and application development offerings, including our broad portfolio of middleware offerings. In addition, our cross-selling efforts resulted in early wins for our emerging technologies, which address CIOs' top priorities that are driving the evolution of enterprise computing. \r\nThis demand led to closing OpenStack, OpenShift and Red Hat cloud infrastructure deals in all of our major geographies. These deals covered a broad group of the industries, from financial services, technology and media, government agencies, research universities, telecommunications, health care, transportation and retail companies.\r\nAs Charlie will detail later, we expect Red Hat to deliver continued solid growth in FY '15, and we plan to continue investing for the long term, with a particular focus on further commercializing and driving adoption of our emerging technologies in cloud computing and Big Data storage.\r\nOur record quarter for both bookings and billings was driven by strong renewals, further expansion of existing customer relationships, growing traction across multiple offerings, new customer acquisition and broadening of our routes to market. With that overview, let's discuss some of the key customer metrics from our fourth quarter.\r\nLarge deal metrics were very strong this quarter. All of the top 30 deals were greater than $1 million for the third quarter in a row. In fact, we've closed a record number of deals in excess of $1 million with more than 70 in total. The 7 deals that were over $5 million also set a record, and 2 of these were over $10 million. \r\nThe growth in our larger deals is not only one of the drivers of our continued solid growth at Red Hat's current scale, it also is an important validation of Red Hat's growing strategic importance with customers. A record 65% of the top 30 deals included a middleware component with 4 all-middleware deals in the group. Cross-selling was even broader in Q4 where 75% of our top deals had a technology component beyond RHEL, including middleware, RHEV, storage, OpenShift and OpenStack technologies.\r\nTechnology and media and telecom cloud had the highest dollar representation in the top 30 deals. Interesting, looking at the number of deals, instead of the dollars, the number of deals was evenly split across our top 4 verticals: financial services, government, technology and media and telecom [ph] cloud, as well as our group of mainstream customers that include customers in health care, retail and travel, among others.\r\nRenewals are an important opportunity to expand our relationship with customers for our core technologies, as well as emerging ones. This quarter, we renewed 24 out of 25 of our largest deals up for renewal during the quarter and 99 out of 100 deals for the fiscal year. These top deals grew at approximately 120% of their previous annualized value during every quarter this year. \r\nWe also saw a number of customers in the top renewals for the quarter by multiple technologies from us, demonstrating our expanding relationship with our top customers. The one deal that did not renew this quarter is a customer that is competing in a consolidating industry. We are still working with the customer and expect to move forward with the new deal in the future.\r\nNow let me update you on some of the progress we've made in our growth initiatives to offer a cohesive, open hybrid cloud solution for our customers in new markets. Here are a few highlights from the quarter: first, we continued to enhance our core platform and application development offerings. For instance, the RHEL 7 data process is moving smoothly as the technology continues to be further hardened. One of the exciting new features of RHEL 7 is Linux Containers, which has emerged as a noteworthy application packaging and delivering technology, combining lightweight application isolation with the flexibility of image-based deployment methods. \r\nRecently, we announced the extension of our certification program to include containerized applications. The Red Hat Container Certification ensures that application containers built using Red Hat Enterprise Linux will operate seamlessly across certified container hosts.\r\nOn the application development side, we released 8 new versions of our middleware offerings over the past year. This quarter, we -- releases included our application performance enhancing, JBoss Data Grid 6.2 and JBoss Data Virtualization 6 to help enterprises turn Big Data into actionable information. \r\nSecond, we expanded our relationship with the largest public cloud providers to give us additional ways to reach new customers, while also providing existing customers with a certified option to run their applications. In February, we expanded our partnership with Amazon to their AWS GovCloud, so that Red Hat offerings are now available globally across every region of AWS. We also continued to add large public cloud providers, as we welcomed AT&T Cloud Services to our Certified Cloud Provider program in Q4.\r\nThird, in addition to Big Data announcements around JBoss Data Virtualization 6, we also deepened our strategic relationship with the leading contributor and provider of enterprise, Apache Hadoop of Hortonworks. As Hadoop continues to gain traction in enterprise Big Data implementations, we want to make sure that it is tightly integrated into Red Hat's open hybrid cloud technologies, such as RHEL, OpenStack platform, Red Hat JBoss Middleware and Red Hat Storage.\r\nFourth, our progress to commercialize OpenStack continues to advance quickly. We continue to see additional downloads, proof of concepts and deal closings. We are experiencing approximately 3,000 downloads per day, increased commitments to POCs, and we closed dozens of new deals. Most customers are still in the initial deployment phase, but we continue to see 6-figure commitments for larger deployments and we closed our first million-dollar deal.\r\nCross-selling in our top deals was also evident with 3 of the top 5 deals having an OpenStack component, and 2 of these deals had an OpenStack and OpenShift component. We also launched our OpenStack training and professional certification program globally and have already certified hundreds on Red Hat OpenStack, with the goal of ramping that number into thousands very rapidly. Further, we've hired a number of OpenStack engineers, overlaid sales people and consultants that we believe will drive further innovation and adoption of these exciting new technologies.\r\nFifth, we announced new relationships with Alcatel-Lucent and Dell to bring OpenStack-based network function virtualization or NFV to the telecom providers. There's a major shift to the telecom market as these providers look to save both CapEx and OpEx with software-based solutions in their networks. This market for carrier-class technology is new for Red Hat and further expands our addressable market. According to IDC, NFV is the fastest-growing piece of the global telecommunications market and is expected to grow rapidly to more than $1 billion in the next few years.\r\nAs we begin our next fiscal year, we are very optimistic about Red Hat's future. Our infrastructure-related offerings, including our CORE platform, continue to have attractive growth opportunities. And our application-related offerings, including our flagship middleware offering and our portfolio of emerging cloud technologies, are increasingly important contributors to our overall success. We are addressing multiple areas of IT spend that are both significant and strategic, and we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity based on Red Hat's proven ability to deliver business value to our customers over the long term.\r\nBefore turning the call over to Charlie, I want to thank each of our Red Hat associates around the globe for their continued focus on driving innovation, supporting our customers and delivering strong results for our shareholders. \r\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Charlie.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nThanks, Jim. I'm pleased to report a strong fourth quarter that demonstrates the continued demand of our offerings, spanning operating systems, middleware and emerging technologies. It also reflects strong execution on the part of our people, which resulted in a compelling combination of revenue growth, profitability and cash flow. \r\nHere are just a few financial highlights on a year-over-year basis: first, our billings proxy for Q4 set a new record at $565 million, up 24% year-over-year in U.S. dollars or 26% in constant currency, with strong growth in both short- and long-term deferred revenue. As a reminder, our billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue to the change in deferred revenue shown on the cash flow statement, which Jim highlighted earlier.\r\nQ4 subscription revenue grew 18% in constant currency or 16% in U.S. dollars. Full year subscription revenue was also up 18% in constant currency and 16% in U.S. dollars. Full year non-GAAP operating income grew 15%, and we hit new record highs for both quarterly and annual operating cash flow of $185 million for the quarter, up 35%; and full year operating cash flow of $541 million, up 16%. And free cash flow grew 21% year-over-year, as CapEx has begun to subside as we predicted.\r\nAs I've done on other year-end calls, I'm going to add a few additional statistics about bookings. To be clear, similar to prior years, we will not be updating these booking statistics on a quarterly basis. First, total backlog for the fiscal year was over $1.56 billion, up 14% year-over-year. We define total backlog as total deferred revenue, which is billed, plus the value of customer contracts to be billed in the future not reflected in our financial statements.\r\nThe total deferred revenue portion for the fiscal year was $1.29 billion, up 18% year-over-year. The portion of total backlog to be billed in the future or our off-balance sheet backlog was in excess of $270 million compared to in excess of $280 million last fiscal year. It's important to note that the portion of off-balance sheet backlog to be billed in the next 12 months was in excess of $190 million, up $10 million from fiscal 2013. \r\nThese results reflect the mix of business that include a larger number of renewable, single-year deals and the impact of growing public cloud revenue that is reported in arrears as revenue. The combination of deferred revenue and off-balance sheet backlog to be billed in the next 12 months gives us very good visibility into a significant portion of fiscal year '15 revenue, which I'll discuss in a moment.\r\nMoving on to bookings by channel and geography.

All regions performed well.\r\nNow let's talk about our financial performance for the quarter, starting with revenue. Fourth quarter revenue was $400 million, up 15% in U.S. dollars from the prior year and at the top end of our guidance, despite a slight FX headwind from guidance rate. On a constant currency basis, revenue would have been $407 million or up 17% from the prior year.\r\nSubscription revenue, which is a renewable revenue stream, constitute approximately 88% of total revenue in Q4. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $351 million, up 16% in U.S. dollars from the prior year. In constant currency, subscription revenue would have been $356 million or up 18% from the prior year.\r\nTraining and services revenue was $49 million, up 8% in U.S. dollars from the year-ago quarter and was down $5 million sequentially, as we experienced our normal Q4 holiday downtime, which reduces the number of consulting and training delivery days.\r\nNow I'll discuss the rest of the results on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation and amortization expense. Overall, gross margin was 86% for Q4, up 10 basis points sequentially and up 10 basis points from the prior year, due to more subscription revenue in the mix. Subscription gross margin was consistent with last quarter and last year at 94%.\r\nThe training and services gross margin is 32%, 220 basis points lower than Q4 last year, due to the increased hiring of OpenStack consultants and training resources ahead of revenue, as we continue to build our global presence in this technology.\r\nFor Q4, non-GAAP operating expense was $248 million, up 2% sequentially and up 15% in U.S. dollars from the prior year. We added over 180 new employees in the quarter, aggressively hiring sales and engineering associates, including those with skills related to our emerging technologies like OpenStack, as I just mentioned.\r\nFor the fiscal year, we increased our headcount about -- by 14% with greater than 80% of the new associates doing [ph] sales, engineering, services and support. Q4 non-GAAP operating income of $97 million increased 16% from last year, resulting in Q4 non-GAAP operating margin of 24.3%. Net interest income was $2 million, consistent with last year.\r\nOur annual effective tax rate was approximately 26% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results, which is lower than the 27.5% rate, which we had estimated last quarter.

Sequentially, deferred revenue increased approximately $166 million from last quarter. \r\nLet me break down the components of deferred revenue for you while factoring in the impact of foreign exchange. Short-term deferred revenue, which ended Q3 at $834 million, had real growth in Q4 of $132 million and increased further just $1 million as a result of changes in the spot rates, ending Q4 at $967 million. \r\nLong-term deferred revenue, which ended Q3 at $290 million, had a real increase in Q4 of approximately $32 million with no material impact as a result of changes in FX spot rates, ending Q4 at $322 million. The total increase in deferred revenue without the impact of currency changes was $164 million, and you can find it on the statement of cash flows.\r\nMoving to the statement of cash flows. We produced a record quarterly operating cash flow of $185 million. That's up 35% year-over-year. Full year operating cash flow was $541 million, up 16% and well above guidance. This overachievement was driven by strong billings and collections and is more remarkable in light of the negative impact to cash flow of the $10 million payment for U.S. taxes, which I mentioned last quarter.\r\nNow to briefly recap and summarize highlights for the full fiscal year. Revenue grew to $1.53 billion, up 17% year-over-year in constant currency or up 15% in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue grew to $1.34 billion, an increase of 18% in constant currency or 16% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP operating margin for the year was 24.5%, 50 basis points higher than initial guidance. That's still allowing for further international expansion and continued investment in emerging technologies.\r\nNon-GAAP operating income grew by 15%. Non-GAAP EPS for the full year was $1.49, up 21% over the prior year. Overall, it was another great year with strong execution.\r\nI now want to shift to fiscal year 2015 guidance. For this guidance, I have assumed average FX rates of $1.37 to the euro and JPY 102 to the dollar. Compared to the year just finished, this represents a 2% strengthening of the euro and a 2% weakening of the yen. Please see our website for other currencies in which we do business.\r\nAs in the past, I'm not attempting to forecast exchange rates. I'm simply taking guidance at this point. So at these foreign exchange rates, we are forecasting total revenue in the range of $1.730 billion to $1.755 billion for fiscal 2015, representing an annual revenue growth rate up to 14% in U.S. dollars. This growth rate assumes that subscription and services revenues will grow at approximately the same rate. We expect services will reaccelerate this year, as training picks up after the introduction of RHEL 7 and consulting for both middleware and OpenStack will continue to grow.\r\nOur operating margin forecast reflects our plan to ramp up investment in emerging technologies and planned launches of core technologies, including RHEL 7. You should expect to see the investment in newer technologies reflected in higher spending in services, support, engineering and sales, which, due to our subscription model, is always ahead of revenue. Based upon our finish to fiscal year 2014 and our current outlook, we are targeting non-GAAP operating margin around 23.5% for the fiscal year 2015, as we continue to invest for growth, particularly around OpenStack.\r\nI'm estimating full year other income, principally net interest income of approximately $8 million or $2 million per quarter. The estimated annual effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 is 29% for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. One of the primary reasons for the rate -- that the rate is higher in fiscal '15 is due to the expiration, once again, of the U.S. R&D tax credit. Assuming a 29% tax rate and approximately 192 million diluted shares, one would estimate diluted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.54 to $1.56 per share.\r\nOn a GAAP basis, we estimate annual stock compensation expense of approximately $135 million and annual amortization expense of approximately $25 million.\r\nFrom a cash flow perspective, we anticipate operating cash flow for the full year between $580 million to $600 million. This assumes approximately 10% cash taxes. We are forecasting CapEx of approximately $50 million, a decrease of almost $30 million from fiscal year '14, which reflects the completion of several major facility expansion projects last year and returning to a more normal run rate. This CapEx reduction is a significant boost to free cash flow, which should grow upwards to 19% this year.\r\nFinally, as we have seen over the last several years, with the recurring revenue model, there's a natural ebb and flow to the business from quarter to quarter. Bookings and billings historically are lowest in Q1, and then they have grown each quarter to the fourth quarter to then repeat the pattern again in the following year. We would expect the same this year. Revenue, on the other hand, has grown every quarter for the last 12 years. \r\nFor Q1, we offer the following guidance: revenue is estimated to be $412 million to $415 million. Non-GAAP operating margin is estimated to be approximately 21%, as a result of the timing this year of the Red Hat Summit in mid-April, the OpenStack summit in May, combined with sales kickoffs and other major marketing events globally and continued hiring in sales and engineering. With interest income of $2 million and a 29% tax rate, non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.32 to $0.33, assuming approximately 192 million diluted shares. \r\nConsistent with my past practice, I do not guide quarterly cash flow because it can be quite variable, depending upon individual large payments or receipts. However, I would say it seems likely that the multiyear pattern of higher cash flow in Q1 than Q2 will repeat, given our strong year-end balance sheet. \r\nIn summary, we are pleased by the strength of our results for fiscal year 2014. We're firmly positioned for further growth and profitability in 2015 and beyond by leveraging emerging technologies that continue to expand our addressable market; larger deals, strong renewals and increasing upsell on our top deals that strengthen our strategic position with customers; a record backlog that provides even better forward visibility; the fastest-growing set of core platform and middleware technologies in the industry; and of course, we have a major product refresh cycle this year.\r\nOn a final note, I hope many of you will be able to join us on April 16 for Analyst Day at the Red Hat Summit in San Francisco. It will be a great opportunity to learn more about our strategy, innovation and customer focus. If you are unable to attend in person, we hope you'll be able to join our live webcast where you'll be able to access all the information that we present.\r\nOperator, I'd now like to turn it back over to you for the first question.",
      "transcript_text3": "I just want to dig into more into your emerging technology product line. So could you give us, like, what's driving at this time, what you are seeing? And especially OpenStack, you talked about, could you tell us, like, what is the use cases you are seeing? And what have you factored in, in terms of growth opportunity there in next couple of years?\n\n---\n\nWell, we're seeing actually -- I kind of see surprisingly strong interest across the board. We certainly have a lot of telcos who are looking to build out their public clouds that we are working with on POCs now. They are the most obvious who were going to want to support an OpenStack. We're seeing it across the banking sector. We're seeing it in telecommunications, technology and media. It's really pretty broad-based on OpenStack. Now we have some pretty sizable aspirations in terms of POCs and design wins. We'll have some reasonable bookings this year but almost no revenue, given the lag of the subscription model associated with OpenStack.\n\n---\n\nCan I speak on that subject, too? Let's talk a little bit, do you remember last quarter, we talked about lag [ph] ? So this year, it's going to be about having the consulting organization kind of working on more projects around OpenStack and then kind of slowly, that turns into more standardized product version that can go out there. Where -- if you look at the early customer discussions you have at the moment, where are you seeing that? Do you think that consulting phase or that kind of engagement phase with the client will be there? Or do you see people are making already big commitments here?\n\n---\n\nRaimo, I think a couple things are important to note. One is on the consulting side that you mentioned. The other is the training and the certification that we mentioned in the prepared remarks. I think, as we said, we have hundreds of people already now certified on Red Hat OpenStack. We are expecting it to be thousands and -- sort of planning on thousands certified. That group of individuals will then go back to their employers and begin to drive it that way, the same way that Red Hat certified engineers did in the early days of Linux. On the consulting side, we are seeing good demand for consulting. And as we've also said, we're beginning to see early days of bookings for subscriptions. But because of the revenue model, as Jim mentioned, it will take a while for that to be meaningful in dollars on the subscription side.\n\n---\n\nJim, I also wanted to ask about OpenStack. In our most recent survey of Red Hat resellers, the Red Hat OpenStack product actually ranked higher in terms of momentum than any other Red Hat product has in the last 3 years. So I'm curious how you think OpenStack feels at this stage. Understanding it's very early stage, but in terms of bonds [ph] or inquiries, downloads, pilots, RFPs, all those kinds of leading indicators, how does that feel relative to how RHEV sales or Gluster sales at this particular stage? And would you say that your conviction in the size of the OpenStack opportunity is changing at all, just given what's -- given the commentary that you gave us upfront on the prepared comments?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, obviously, there's substantially more interest in OpenStack, frankly, than there's been in really any product since Linux. There's a huge need for cloud infrastructure, and there are not a lot of alternatives out there. Most of the industry have declared that they're behind OpenStack. So there's just a lot of organic interest, where things like RHEV, Red Hat had to go out and create it. So substantially more, and that's really what's driving our relative bullishness in investment in it as we go through this year. But yes, a different zip code than RHEV or Gluster.\n\n---\n\nJim, you're seeing, at least by all accounts, and from what we hear, I think, a significantly growing business with third party customers that are running virtual instances of RHEL in the public cloud and it all sounds as though OpenShift continues to gain pretty strong momentum there as well. Do you have any sense of, on the RHEL side, how much of that public cloud business at this point is incremental versus cannibalistic?\n\n---\n\nWe -- this is Charlie. We -- first of all, a couple of statistics. We've looked at the public cloud contribution, and we're up 40% at the end of the year from where we started from last year in terms of what's coming from third-party customers running virtual instances in public clouds. We have had a discussion with a very large cloud provider indicated to us that about 55% of their workload based on surveys, their brand new customers for Red Hat is on [ph] new business, and it's very consistent. It is -- this is -- looks -- it looks sustainable and growing every month.\n\n---\n\nAnd that's a survey done every quarter, and those results are consistent between 55% and 60% of the revenue -- of the customer count and that's -- those customers' revenue are brand new to Red Hat, which is great to see.\n\n---\n\nCharlie, I think it's your 10th year as CFO, so nice to see the very consistent execution in the financial results. Remember meeting with you the first time, I think the stock was about 20% of its current level, so a nice shout on that. My question on OpenStack is, when you look at some of the levers you have with RHEL 6, you had a price increase lever for more than 2 socket servers and I think you had uplift from the free to fee, whatnot. But as you look at the RHEL 7 cycle, what are the -- if you can walk through what could be the levers that could help your customer wallet share at a unit level, where are the incremental opportunity from this cycle versus the last cycle?\n\n---\n\nKash, it's a good question. That's one -- I think the appropriate answer is we're going through that in a lot of depth at the Red Hat Summit, and so we hope you'll come. You'll get some of the technical side of it. There's some significant differences in the technologies than where we are with RHEL 6. The early feedback on the beta is really good. But I think I'll leave it at that. And from a pricing perspective, we don't -- really don't have anything that we would announce until something was announceable so...\n\n---\n\nIt looks like you guys really exited FY '14 with a really nice head of steam, with billings growth accelerating to -- in the back half -- by 22% in the back half. Against that sort of 20%-plus billings growth in the back half of FY '14, the revenue guide for FY '14, that's 13.5 at the midpoint seems to be a pretty big deceleration. Can you help us understand that disconnect? What are you seeing in the business that would cause that type of deceleration into FY '15?\n\n---\n\nI think one of things I'd start what is the total backlog, the deferred revenue plus the off-balance sheet backlog, the 14% growth there is a pretty good indicator of what you would expect to see in the coming year of revenue, which -- and so you see a guide that's very similar. But that's a reasonable starting point. The newer technologies that we're -- we want to invest a lot in are still small by comparison but can be meaningful in subsequent years. The subscription model has expenses at least a year or 2 before meaningful revenue. But the starting point would be the backlog growth in the prior year.\n\n---\n\nCharlie, just a follow-up on the backlog growth. I think in '12 and '13, you were having high-teen backlog growth and this year, you had 14%. Is there something that's changing in terms of the structure of the contract in terms of seeing the decel in terms of the growth? Or are you just kind of working up from a much bigger base that would describe that deceleration?\n\n---\n\nYes. There's probably 2 things I would point it to. One is the average contract duration is still around 21 months. But if you look at the portion that is within 12 months at the end of the year, we are at 76%. The 24%, which is a portion that goes beyond the year, it's -- there's a slight difference in both years, this year and last year. It rounds the 21 months. But there's a slight shortening this year that has -- that accounts for a part of it. The second thing I would mention is this idea of the public cloud revenue. It is not -- it's revenue that is reported for activity in the prior month. And therefore, when the report comes in, it's an immediate billing. There is no deferred revenue. It's immediate billing and immediate revenue, so maybe a little of the change coming there as well.\n\n---\n\nOne billing question, one fundamental question. On the billings side, obviously, a very strong bookings quarter than the -- close to last year. How much of the strong billings this quarter was a function of just a billing of stuff that got booked in the year ago at fourth quarter close? And then I have a fundamental question.\n\n---\n\nI mean one measure of that is the off-balance sheet backlog. The total off-balance sheet backlog this year was in excess of $270 million. Last year was an excess of $280 million. And as I said, it's important to note that the portion billable within the next 12 months actually went the other way, increased by $10 million. So this year, it's in excess of $190 million billable in the next 12 months. So depending upon how you look at that, you could say it's either $10 million negative or $10 million positive to that total billings number. Either way, it's a rounding here on the total billing for the quarter. It will be a really good quarter regardless.\n\n---\n\nAnd then on the fundamental side, back to -- focusing on Linux, we've historically asked you about the UNIX-Linux migrations. One of the things that occurred in the last quarter or so was a big pickup at folks from IBM on the move to Linux on power. Any positive impact there at all?\n\n---\n\nWhile it's great to have them continuing to talk about moving mission-critical workloads over, that will clearly have an impact for us. Those are conversations that generally take a while, so we don't see anything at the numbers yet, but it's great to see IBM recognizing the power of that OS on the power chip. So we should see that in the future.\n\n---\n\nCharlie, just revisiting your revenue guidance comments, I understand the 14% backlog growth, and that's where the revenue growth is more or less. But there's some elements that are not in there like the cloud revenue you mentioned, which are only cloud and services. Growth rates are [indiscernible] . So should we think -- are those numbers too small to make an impact right now? And when should we expect those numbers to become meaningful? When will we start seeing acceleration in revenue growth for you guys?\n\n---\n\nThe numbers are still small enough that they're not going to change in a meaningful way out of $1.7 billion total number. But I think the growth rate we're seeing there is very good. It continues on that pace. It -- obviously, over time, it's going to be meaningful.\n\n---\n\nCharlie, I'm going to have one more go on the revenue guidance. Is there anything you can say about prevailing FX rates and the impact of prevailing rates that would have on the growth rate? And then my follow-up would be, Jim, can you just give us a recap on which sort of large tech OEMs have formerly agreed to partner with Red Hat around OpenStack certifications?\n\n---\n\nThe -- yes, the first question on foreign exchange, as I said, I'm pegging this guidance at a rate that has a euro that's about 2% stronger and the yen about 2% weaker than the last year. And those are only 2 of the currencies. They are the 2 important currencies for us. But frankly, if you went through the whole list of currencies, which you can do by looking at it in our website, you're going to see that the Latin American currencies have depreciated significantly, 20%-plus. And the Indian currency, the Australian currency have all depreciated somewhat. So there is -- there probably is some additional FX impact in those numbers, but the 2 biggest currencies still are going to be the yen and the euro. And Jim?\n\n---\n\nIn terms of officially -- I mean, Dell has gotten fully behind Red Hat's OpenStack. Alcatel-Lucent has as well on the telecom equipment providers. Yes, we're working actively with the other major OEMs. I think we're making great commercial progress, yet to have them say that we're their only choice. But we're actively, I think, making great progress with several of them. Come to the Summit.\n\n---\n\nBy all accounts, you guys had a very strong year in terms of the middleware business. I was just wondering, could you give us some color on how that's trending, heading into this fiscal year? Obviously, it can't continue to contribute the same type of growth rate, even on larger numbers. Or I guess, just how are you thinking about that heading into fiscal '15?\n\n---\n\nThat's a great question, and it's a great set-up. Middleware had a great year. And for all of you who've been waiting for a long time to find some further breakdown of the numbers, at the -- if you come to Analyst Day on April 16, we're going to share some further breakdown there. But in summary for this call, middleware had a great year, growing quite a bit faster than what I would call the base business or the Linux business.\n\n---\n\nJust a quick question on linearity, I think, Charlie, you mentioned that it was more linear than in the past. Are we back to where we were in the pre-financial crisis linearity? Or maybe you can give us some color on that.\n\n---\n\nSure. Well, first of all, fourth quarters for us are generally a more linear quarter than any other quarter in the year because a number of companies have the December 31 year-end, so we booked a good bit of business in December. And then, of course, because it's our year-end, our guys are working hard anyway to close things by the end of February. So generally, it's more linear. I went back over the last 6 years or so, and we only had one other year in the last 6 years that had as good linearity as this year did in the fourth quarter. So I don't know whether, Tim, whether it is sustainable, whether that linearity is a -- was a fluke for the quarter or not, but we are very pleased to see it and we like that kind of thing.\n\n---\n\nJust like to ask a very high-level question. If you step way back, you saw your growth accelerate in billings to 20% plus in the second half of the year. What do you think is driving that accelerated growth?\n\n---\n\nWell, we just had an awful lot of large deals. As Jim mentioned, it's over 70 deals over $1 million. That's a substantial jump from where we've been. In some cases, it's simply maybe the timing of the deals on the billing terms, as we've said before. In many cases, I would say, you may want to be thinking of our fourth quarter rolling average billings number. So I don't want people to get euphoric with the 24%, but I don't -- also don't think people should get despondent if it's a lower number. We've seen that over the last year or 2. As I've said, billing is one metric. We had a great quarter. The guys really worked hard, and we had a lot of big deals. That's kind of just it in a nutshell.\n\n---\n\nI was wondering if you could characterize, going back to the core RHEL business, the relative impact of UNIX-to-Linux and Windows-to-Linux conversions. And also, to what extent some of the true-ups you've had in the past have played a role in the quarter?\n\n---\n\nSure. So I mean, everybody knows that the UNIX-to-Linux conversion is winding down a bit. If you look at the -- however, if you look at the information from IDC, it still got a long ways to go. I think it is true that the Windows-to-Linux conversion is kicking up. We're seeing more of that. IDC is predicting that. Another factor that I don't think we talk about much is the embedded use of Linux and a whole lot of other technologies. We have a big effort going on that to increase our sales with manufacturers that may use it in an embedded area, so that's another area. The free to pay continues to make progress. So it's a number of factors. And again, we'll probably go through this in a lot more depth at the Red Hat Summit on April 16.\n\n---\n\nYes. We talked about our large renewals growth at 20% and obviously, there's cross-sell in that. But they're still core -- in our core customer, solid double-digit growth in our renewals, and that's obviously captured in computing growth. And so that -- I mean, it's a combination of all of the above, it's new workflows, it's migrations from Windows, migrations from UNIX. It's hard for us to break it out in total, but we can clearly see that we're growing share with our core customers.\n\n---\n\nAnd I guess the last thing I'd say, it's also the rapid growth of virtual instances for which we get paid.\n\n---\n\nCharlie, I'm wondering if you can just talk it through. You had really strong off-balance sheet backlog this year or last year. This year, [indiscernible] was flat. The billings last year were a little weaker. This year, they're stronger. I'm wondering if there's some sort of renewal cyclicality that's going through those numbers, if you could help us understand that.\n\n---\n\nI think that's a good question, because it is important to note that if you have a 3-year deal, obviously, it's going to be 3 years before you see that again and so there is some of that. So it happens all the time. It's hard to identify an individual transaction or even a group of transactions that would be necessarily significant. But this is what I referred to as the natural ebb and flow of the business. When you have -- we had big transactions 3 years ago. Those big transactions may be renewing this year. If you didn't have those, and then obviously, they would not. So that -- renewals and timing is definitely going to be a factor.\n\n---\n\nCharlie, just a couple of questions on the operating margin guidance. I think the Street, in general, is looking for flattish operating margins this year. It looks like it will be down 100 basis points. I'm wondering if your view of your margin projections changed at all during the quarter. And if they did, what may have been the catalyst for that? And a related question is, I guess, if you're going to do Q1 operating margins of 21% and end the year at 23.5%, they need to reaccelerate after Q1. So perhaps you could offer a little color on sort of the quarterly progression of that margin and spend.\n\n---\n\nSure. I think the -- at the end of the Q3 call, I tried to set the stage for -- we believe we've had a significant growth opportunity ahead of us in some of these new technologies. We made a firm decision in our fourth quarter that is exactly what we want to do. We want to invest, and we think we have a reasonable balance of growth and profit. But there are times in the market when you have to take -- go for it, and this is definitely one of them. So we are, as I said in my prepared remarks, and I think Jim did as well, we're got be adding engineers, salespeople, support people, consultants, trainers to go after this market, including OpenStack. Relative to Q1, there's a whole lot of things that sort of coming together in Q1 that are causing that. Last year, our Red Hat Summit was actually in the second quarter. This year, it's in April. So that's one significant event. The second thing is the OpenStack Summit, which is being held in Atlanta in May, is sort of a new expense for us and we intend to be present there. We've -- and we have a lot of other significant marketing things we're doing in Q1, as well as the hiring. So that basically sums it up, and you're quite right, margin will improve accordingly thereafter. And I would assume that, that improvement would continue right on into the following year.\n\n---\n\nJust a question on the UNIX-to-Linux migration phase. There's a lot less UNIX than, say, 5 years ago. So should we expect RHEL growth to kind of increasingly be driven by x86 workloads and maybe a little less from UNIX-to-Linux?\n\n---\n\nIt's entirely possible. But what you'll see here is increased Linux from the Windows conversion also from embedded, as I said, and then the virtual instances running either in a data center or maybe even a public cloud. I think you're going to find a fair amount of revenue from that. But I do think there's a lot of runway left on UNIX, so don't sell it short. As I said, IDC statistics show up a pretty good runway for at least the next 5 years.\n\n---\n\nWell, thank you very much, everyone, and hope to see all at Red Hat Summit. If you need any registration information, please reach out to myself or Sarah Walas in Investor Relations. Have a good evening. Thank you.",

It is -- this is -- looks -- it looks sustainable and growing every month.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nAnd that's a survey done every quarter, and those results are consistent between 55% and 60% of the revenue -- of the customer count and that's -- those customers' revenue are brand new to Red Hat, which is great to see.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kash Rangan (Analysts)】\nCharlie, I think it's your 10th year as CFO, so nice to see the very consistent execution in the financial results. Remember meeting with you the first time, I think the stock was about 20% of its current level, so a nice shout on that. My question on OpenStack is, when you look at some of the levers you have with RHEL 6, you had a price increase lever for more than 2 socket servers and I think you had uplift from the free to fee, whatnot. But as you look at the RHEL 7 cycle, what are the -- if you can walk through what could be the levers that could help your customer wallet share at a unit level, where are the incremental opportunity from this cycle versus the last cycle?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nKash, it's a good question. That's one -- I think the appropriate answer is we're going through that in a lot of depth at the Red Hat Summit, and so we hope you'll come. You'll get some of the technical side of it. There's some significant differences in the technologies than where we are with RHEL 6. The early feedback on the beta is really good. But I think I'll leave it at that. And from a pricing perspective, we don't -- really don't have anything that we would announce until something was announceable so...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Weiss (Analysts)】\nIt looks like you guys really exited FY '14 with a really nice head of steam, with billings growth accelerating to -- in the back half -- by 22% in the back half. Against that sort of 20%-plus billings growth in the back half of FY '14, the revenue guide for FY '14, that's 13.5 at the midpoint seems to be a pretty big deceleration. Can you help us understand that disconnect? What are you seeing in the business that would cause that type of deceleration into FY '15?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nI think one of things I'd start what is the total backlog, the deferred revenue plus the off-balance sheet backlog, the 14% growth there is a pretty good indicator of what you would expect to see in the coming year of revenue, which -- and so you see a guide that's very similar. But that's a reasonable starting point. The newer technologies that we're -- we want to invest a lot in are still small by comparison but can be meaningful in subsequent years. The subscription model has expenses at least a year or 2 before meaningful revenue. But the starting point would be the backlog growth in the prior year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brent Thill (Analysts)】\nCharlie, just a follow-up on the backlog growth. I think in '12 and '13, you were having high-teen backlog growth and this year, you had 14%. Is there something that's changing in terms of the structure of the contract in terms of seeing the decel in terms of the growth? Or are you just kind of working up from a much bigger base that would describe that deceleration?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nYes. There's probably 2 things I would point it to. One is the average contract duration is still around 21 months. But if you look at the portion that is within 12 months at the end of the year, we are at 76%. The 24%, which is a portion that goes beyond the year, it's -- there's a slight difference in both years, this year and last year. It rounds the 21 months. But there's a slight shortening this year that has -- that accounts for a part of it. The second thing I would mention is this idea of the public cloud revenue. It is not -- it's revenue that is reported for activity in the prior month. And therefore, when the report comes in, it's an immediate billing. There is no deferred revenue. It's immediate billing and immediate revenue, so maybe a little of the change coming there as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Turits (Analysts)】\nOne billing question, one fundamental question. On the billings side, obviously, a very strong bookings quarter than the -- close to last year. How much of the strong billings this quarter was a function of just a billing of stuff that got booked in the year ago at fourth quarter close? And then I have a fundamental question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nI mean one measure of that is the off-balance sheet backlog. The total off-balance sheet backlog this year was in excess of $270 million. Last year was an excess of $280 million. And as I said, it's important to note that the portion billable within the next 12 months actually went the other way, increased by $10 million. So this year, it's in excess of $190 million billable in the next 12 months. So depending upon how you look at that, you could say it's either $10 million negative or $10 million positive to that total billings number. Either way, it's a rounding here on the total billing for the quarter. It will be a really good quarter regardless.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Turits (Analysts)】\nAnd then on the fundamental side, back to -- focusing on Linux, we've historically asked you about the UNIX-Linux migrations. One of the things that occurred in the last quarter or so was a big pickup at folks from IBM on the move to Linux on power. Any positive impact there at all?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWhile it's great to have them continuing to talk about moving mission-critical workloads over, that will clearly have an impact for us. Those are conversations that generally take a while, so we don't see anything at the numbers yet, but it's great to see IBM recognizing the power of that OS on the power chip. So we should see that in the future.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Abhey Lamba (Analysts)】\nCharlie, just revisiting your revenue guidance comments, I understand the 14% backlog growth, and that's where the revenue growth is more or less. But there's some elements that are not in there like the cloud revenue you mentioned, which are only cloud and services. Growth rates are [indiscernible] . So should we think -- are those numbers too small to make an impact right now? And when should we expect those numbers to become meaningful? When will we start seeing acceleration in revenue growth for you guys?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nThe numbers are still small enough that they're not going to change in a meaningful way out of $1.7 billion total number. But I think the growth rate we're seeing there is very good. It continues on that pace. It -- obviously, over time, it's going to be meaningful.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ross MacMillan (Analysts)】\nCharlie, I'm going to have one more go on the revenue guidance. Is there anything you can say about prevailing FX rates and the impact of prevailing rates that would have on the growth rate? And then my follow-up would be, Jim, can you just give us a recap on which sort of large tech OEMs have formerly agreed to partner with Red Hat around OpenStack certifications?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nThe -- yes, the first question on foreign exchange, as I said, I'm pegging this guidance at a rate that has a euro that's about 2% stronger and the yen about 2% weaker than the last year. And those are only 2 of the currencies. They are the 2 important currencies for us. But frankly, if you went through the whole list of currencies, which you can do by looking at it in our website, you're going to see that the Latin American currencies have depreciated significantly, 20%-plus. And the Indian currency, the Australian currency have all depreciated somewhat. So there is -- there probably is some additional FX impact in those numbers, but the 2 biggest currencies still are going to be the yen and the euro. And Jim?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nIn terms of officially -- I mean, Dell has gotten fully behind Red Hat's OpenStack. Alcatel-Lucent has as well on the telecom equipment providers. Yes, we're working actively with the other major OEMs. I think we're making great commercial progress, yet to have them say that we're their only choice. But we're actively, I think, making great progress with several of them. Come to the Summit.\n\n---\n\n【質問: S. Kirk Materne (Analysts)】\nBy all accounts, you guys had a very strong year in terms of the middleware business. I was just wondering, could you give us some color on how that's trending, heading into this fiscal year? Obviously, it can't continue to contribute the same type of growth rate, even on larger numbers. Or I guess, just how are you thinking about that heading into fiscal '15?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nThat's a great question, and it's a great set-up. Middleware had a great year. And for all of you who've been waiting for a long time to find some further breakdown of the numbers, at the -- if you come to Analyst Day on April 16, we're going to share some further breakdown there. But in summary for this call, middleware had a great year, growing quite a bit faster than what I would call the base business or the Linux business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tim Klasell (Analysts)】\nJust a quick question on linearity, I think, Charlie, you mentioned that it was more linear than in the past. Are we back to where we were in the pre-financial crisis linearity? Or maybe you can give us some color on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nSure. Well, first of all, fourth quarters for us are generally a more linear quarter than any other quarter in the year because a number of companies have the December 31 year-end, so we booked a good bit of business in December. And then, of course, because it's our year-end, our guys are working hard anyway to close things by the end of February. So generally, it's more linear. I went back over the last 6 years or so, and we only had one other year in the last 6 years that had as good linearity as this year did in the fourth quarter. So I don't know whether, Tim, whether it is sustainable, whether that linearity is a -- was a fluke for the quarter or not, but we are very pleased to see it and we like that kind of thing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Ashley (Analysts)】\nJust like to ask a very high-level question. If you step way back, you saw your growth accelerate in billings to 20% plus in the second half of the year. What do you think is driving that accelerated growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nWell, we just had an awful lot of large deals. As Jim mentioned, it's over 70 deals over $1 million. That's a substantial jump from where we've been. In some cases, it's simply maybe the timing of the deals on the billing terms, as we've said before. In many cases, I would say, you may want to be thinking of our fourth quarter rolling average billings number. So I don't want people to get euphoric with the 24%, but I don't -- also don't think people should get despondent if it's a lower number. We've seen that over the last year or 2. As I've said, billing is one metric. We had a great quarter. The guys really worked hard, and we had a lot of big deals. That's kind of just it in a nutshell.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Maguire (Analysts)】\nI was wondering if you could characterize, going back to the core RHEL business, the relative impact of UNIX-to-Linux and Windows-to-Linux conversions. And also, to what extent some of the true-ups you've had in the past have played a role in the quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nSure. So I mean, everybody knows that the UNIX-to-Linux conversion is winding down a bit. If you look at the -- however, if you look at the information from IDC, it still got a long ways to go. I think it is true that the Windows-to-Linux conversion is kicking up. We're seeing more of that. IDC is predicting that. Another factor that I don't think we talk about much is the embedded use of Linux and a whole lot of other technologies. We have a big effort going on that to increase our sales with manufacturers that may use it in an embedded area, so that's another area. The free to pay continues to make progress. So it's a number of factors. And again, we'll probably go through this in a lot more depth at the Red Hat Summit on April 16.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes. We talked about our large renewals growth at 20% and obviously, there's cross-sell in that. But they're still core -- in our core customer, solid double-digit growth in our renewals, and that's obviously captured in computing growth. And so that -- I mean, it's a combination of all of the above, it's new workflows, it's migrations from Windows, migrations from UNIX. It's hard for us to break it out in total, but we can clearly see that we're growing share with our core customers.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nAnd I guess the last thing I'd say, it's also the rapid growth of virtual instances for which we get paid.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Walter Pritchard (Analysts)】\nCharlie, I'm wondering if you can just talk it through. You had really strong off-balance sheet backlog this year or last year. This year, [indiscernible] was flat. The billings last year were a little weaker. This year, they're stronger. I'm wondering if there's some sort of renewal cyclicality that's going through those numbers, if you could help us understand that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nI think that's a good question, because it is important to note that if you have a 3-year deal, obviously, it's going to be 3 years before you see that again and so there is some of that. So it happens all the time. It's hard to identify an individual transaction or even a group of transactions that would be necessarily significant. But this is what I referred to as the natural ebb and flow of the business. When you have -- we had big transactions 3 years ago. Those big transactions may be renewing this year. If you didn't have those, and then obviously, they would not. So that -- renewals and timing is definitely going to be a factor.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karl Keirstead (Analysts)】\nCharlie, just a couple of questions on the operating margin guidance. I think the Street, in general, is looking for flattish operating margins this year. It looks like it will be down 100 basis points. I'm wondering if your view of your margin projections changed at all during the quarter. And if they did, what may have been the catalyst for that? And a related question is, I guess, if you're going to do Q1 operating margins of 21% and end the year at 23.5%, they need to reaccelerate after Q1. So perhaps you could offer a little color on sort of the quarterly progression of that margin and spend.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nSure. I think the -- at the end of the Q3 call, I tried to set the stage for -- we believe we've had a significant growth opportunity ahead of us in some of these new technologies. We made a firm decision in our fourth quarter that is exactly what we want to do. We want to invest, and we think we have a reasonable balance of growth and profit. But there are times in the market when you have to take -- go for it, and this is definitely one of them. So we are, as I said in my prepared remarks, and I think Jim did as well, we're got be adding engineers, salespeople, support people, consultants, trainers to go after this market, including OpenStack. Relative to Q1, there's a whole lot of things that sort of coming together in Q1 that are causing that. Last year, our Red Hat Summit was actually in the second quarter. This year, it's in April. So that's one significant event. The second thing is the OpenStack Summit, which is being held in Atlanta in May, is sort of a new expense for us and we intend to be present there. We've -- and we have a lot of other significant marketing things we're doing in Q1, as well as the hiring. So that basically sums it up, and you're quite right, margin will improve accordingly thereafter. And I would assume that, that improvement would continue right on into the following year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Wood (Analysts)】\nJust a question on the UNIX-to-Linux migration phase. There's a lot less UNIX than, say, 5 years ago. So should we expect RHEL growth to kind of increasingly be driven by x86 workloads and maybe a little less from UNIX-to-Linux?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nIt's entirely possible. But what you'll see here is increased Linux from the Windows conversion also from embedded, as I said, and then the virtual instances running either in a data center or maybe even a public cloud. I think you're going to find a fair amount of revenue from that. But I do think there's a lot of runway left on UNIX, so don't sell it short. As I said, IDC statistics show up a pretty good runway for at least the next 5 years.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nWell, thank you very much, everyone, and hope to see all at Red Hat Summit. If you need any registration information, please reach out to myself or Sarah Walas in Investor Relations. Have a good evening. Thank you.",

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.\r\nBefore we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.\r\nBoth our fourth quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] \r\nI will now turn the call over to Rodney McMullen, Chief Executive Officer of Kroger. Rodney?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Cindy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and full year 2013 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\r\nOur associates continue to execute our accelerated growth plan, resulting in a great quarter and a full year we are proud of. Kroger is delivering on the key performance targets we committed to when we outlined our long-term growth strategy at our October 2012 investor meeting. Mike Schlotman will give more details about each of the 4 metrics, but I'd like to share the highlights. \r\nWe achieved our 41st consecutive quarter of identical supermarket sales growth. We expanded our rolling 4-quarter FIFO operating margin excluding fuel. We improved our return on invested capital even as we increased capital investments, and we increased our market share in 2013.\r\nFor the full year, we continue to perform for shareholders by delivering adjusted earnings per share growth of 13%. We achieved our ninth consecutive year of reducing operating expense as a rate of sales, and we returned 600 -- or $928 million to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. That we accomplished all of this while also successfully completing our merger with Harris Teeter is a great testament to our associates' determined focus on serving our customers. We are confident that 2014 will be a great year and that we will continue to deliver growth that investors can count on.\r\nConsistent with what we've been saying for the last several years, we expect the economic recovery in 2014 to remain fragile and uneven. Things will continue to get better for some customers, while others remain under economic stress, and we are doing all we can to help. For customers focused on their budget, we continue to offer low entry price points on key items, especially in our corporate brands portfolio.\r\nIf you look at our SNAP households during the fourth quarter, they increased their total monthly spending in our stores for each of the 3 months since the benefit reductions took effect compared to the prior year. What we saw play out in the fourth quarter was what we anticipated, that SNAP customers spent more of their own cash on food.\r\nAll of our customers are benefiting from our relentless focus on friendly service and fresh products, including our organic and natural foods and our own unique brands like Simple Truth. We have a lot of room to grow because the overall industry in which we operate in is expanding. We continue to improve our connection with customers across the entire spectrum. Whether value, mainstream or upscale customers, we are competitively positioned to deliver the right value proposition, and our customer insights help us to focus on the right opportunities for growth in each segment, so that we will capture more of the share of the massive food market.\r\nNow I'll turn it over to Mike Ellis to outline our operational performance. Mike?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Rodney. Good morning, everyone. We continue to have opportunity with our low customers because on average, we capture $0.50 of every $1 they spend on the products that we sell. This figure has remained steady due to the effect that new households have on this calculation. As we told you in December, our loyal household count has increased by an outstanding 83% over the past decade. We do, however, see incrementally more spending from our mature loyal households.\r\nDuring the fourth quarter, we continue to grow the number of loyal households and at a much faster rate than total household growth, which was also up for the quarter. We continue to improve our friendliness, product freshness, shopping experience and price perception in our customers' eyes. As you know, we closely tracked these 4 keys against our competitors. What we have been tracking internally is consistent with the independent American Customer Satisfaction Index released last month, which reported steady improvement in Kroger customer satisfaction.\r\nInflation was low in the fourth quarter. We expect inflation to be low in 2014 as well, which is reflected in our identical store sales guidance for the year, which Mike Schlotman will talk about shortly. A key driver of growth is our commitment to Customer 1st innovation. As you know, we have done a lot of innovative things over the past couple of years to create unique competitive advantages for Kroger, like our faster checkout initiative. Each quarter, we will highlight one or more innovations that improve our connection with customers and improve our market share. This quarter, I will highlight corporate brands and digital.\r\nCorporate brands continue to be leading differentiator for Kroger. We introduced 937 new products in fiscal 2013, including 100 new Simple Truth items. Simple Truth continues to grow at an astonishing pace, and we now expect it to reach $1 billion brand status by the end of fiscal 2014.\r\nCorporate brands continue to gain market share during the fourth quarter, with corporate brands representing approximately 27.2% of total units sold and 24.4% of our sales dollars, including pharmacy and fuel.\r\nWe recently announced the exciting new acquisition of our digital coupon marketing provider, YOU Technology. We believe that YOU Tech has strong growth potential and will, over time, become the leading digital coupon provider for U.S. retailers, not just Kroger. YOU Tech has helped us reach another digital milestone recently. We began offering digital coupons in early 2010 and within 3 years, our customers had downloaded 500 million digital coupons. Customers download the next 500 million in only 14 months. In fact, at approximately 5:57 p.m. Eastern Time on February 6, a customer downloaded Kroger's 1 billionth digital coupon. It was an exciting moment for us and one that demonstrates the growth and customer acceptance of our digital efforts.\r\nNow I will provide a brief update on labor relations. We're currently negotiating contracts in Cincinnati, Atlanta and Southern California. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for all of our associates. In fact, we added more than 7,000 jobs last year and more than 40,000 jobs over the last 6 years. Those numbers are even larger when you include Harris Teeter's more than 25,000 associates.\r\nNow Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's growth metrics and financial results, as well as our guidance for 2014. Mike?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. We exceeded our expectations for the quarter and the year, thanks to our associates performing to deliver growth. We continue to implement our long-term growth strategy, which includes targeting capital to grow our business in new and existing markets, leveraging customer insights to solve varied customer needs through both traditional and digital channels and continuing our share buyback program. As Rodney mentioned earlier, when we outlined our accelerated growth strategy at our October 2012 investor conference, we also identified 4 key performance targets for shareholders to measure our progress. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the results in each metric.\r\nOur first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter ID sales growth of 4.3%. This strong performance was supported by ID sales growth in every department and every supermarket division. We continue to see outstanding double-digit identical sales growth in our natural foods department. Our produce and deli bakery departments also posted strong ID sales growth, highlighting our customers' continued demand for fresh products. Kroger's pharmacy department continues to outperform as well. Our ID sales results, in light of the slow economic recovery and low inflation throughout the year, are quite remarkable. Weather conditions across much of the country were a net positive as well. Our team's Customer 1st response to weather events kept our stores open and shelf stock, which coupled with our convenient locations, made Kroger more accessible for customers who flock to stores to stock up before winter storms.\r\nFor only 4 quarters adjusted FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and the extra week, increased by 11 basis points compared to the adjusted fiscal 2012 result. This is a result above our commitment to grow the rates slightly over time on a rolling 4 quarters' basis.\r\nThe third target metric is return on invested capital. We reported a return on invested capital, excluding Harris Teeter, on a 52-week rolling 4 quarters' basis of 13.43% compared to 13.42% during the same period last year. As we told you, as we increase capital investments, it will be more difficult to grow ROIC in the near term. However, as these investments mature, we expect them to be accretive to ROIC.\r\nOur fourth target metric is market share growth, which we report on annually. We look at market share the way customers would look at it, where they spend their money. In the past, we use Nielsen Homescan data as our source for market share. We're now using a different Nielsen product, Nielsen POS plus, which includes all point-of-sale data from several competitors and includes all departments inside our stores, except for pharmacy. We believe Nielsen POS plus is a good data -- is a good and consistent source. While POS plus does not include all of our competitors today, it covers -- captures roughly 85% of the items we sell, including most perishable items, which Nielsen Homescan did not include. \r\nAccording to Nielsen POS data, Kroger's overall market share of the products we sell in the markets where we operate grew approximately 50 basis points during 2013. This data also indicates that our share increased in 16 of the 18 markets outlined by the Nielsen Report and was down slightly in 2 markets. \r\nWalmart supercenters are 1 of our top 2 competitors in 13 of the 18 markets outlined in the Nielsen report. Kroger increased share in 12 of those markets and declined slightly in 1. The Nielsen POS data is generated by real retailers who report their sales to Nielsen. This includes food, drug, mass and dollar channels. This does not include C-store and club.\r\nNow I'll share our fourth quarter results and fiscal 2013 results. Please note that Harris Teeter is included in the company's ending balance sheet, but because of the timing late in the year, it had no effect on our adjusted fourth quarter or fiscal 2013 earnings. If you remember last year, we gave you details to better understand how our core business performed. This year, we have similarly outlined our adjustments for fiscal 2013 and 2012 in Table 6 of our earnings release. The following results are all adjusted as outlined in Table 6 and exclude the effect of the 53rd week last year.\r\nIn the fourth quarter, our net earnings totaled $421.9 million or $0.81 per diluted share. Excluding the items outlined in Table 6, Kroger's adjusted net earnings per diluted share grew 10% to $0.78 in the fourth quarter. We recorded a $9.7 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to $41.2 million credit in the same quarter last year. FIFO gross margin increased 11 basis points from the same period last year excluding retail fuel operations.\r\nOperating, general and administrative costs plus rent and depreciation, excluding retail fuel operations, declined 16 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the prior year's adjusted fourth quarter.\r\nBefore I move on to discuss Kroger's full year 2013 results, I'll share some data on our retail fuel operations. About half of our supermarkets have fuel centers today. In the fourth quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.113 compared to $0.13 in the same quarter last year, after adjusting for the additional week. For the full year, the cents per gallon fuel margin was roughly $0.141 compared with $0.14 last year, again, after adjusting for the additional week.\r\nTurning now to full year 2013 results, Kroger reported total sales of $98.4 billion in fiscal 2013, an increase of 3.9% after adjusting for the extra week last year. On this basis, and excluding fuel, total sales increased 4.2% over the prior year. Identical supermarket sales without fuel increased 3.6% in fiscal 2013 compared with the prior year. Net earnings for fiscal 2013 totaled $1.52 billion or $2.90 per diluted share, adjusted net earnings of $1.5 billion or $2.85 per share, a growth of 13%.\r\nKroger's LIFO charge for fiscal 2013 was comparable to fiscal 2012. Strong identical sales and cost controls allowed Kroger to leverage operating expenses as a rate of sales for the ninth consecutive year. In fiscal 2013, OG&A costs plus rent and depreciation without fuel and the extra week were down 24 basis points.\r\nFor 2014, our planned uses of cash remain unchanged, maintain our current investment-grade debt rating, repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend and fund increasing capital investments. Net total debt was $10.9 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion from a year ago as a result of the Harris Teeter transaction and due to the timing late in our fiscal year, we realized no incremental EBITDA in 2013 from this transaction. Therefore, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.43 compared to 2.04 during the same period last year.\r\nKroger remains committed to managing its free cash flow to achieve a 2 to 2.2x net total debt to EBITDA ratio over the next 18 to 24 months. \r\nCapital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities, totaled $2.3 billion for the year compared to $2 billion for 2012. For 2014, we expect capital investments to be in the $2.8 billion to $3 billion range, including Harris Teeter. As you know, part of our long-term growth strategy is to increase capital investments over time. This will take the form of adding square footage in markets where we believe our business model is already resonating with customers. With a better presence, we can grow our market share and return on invested capital. We continue to make good progress adding square footage in our fill-in markets, and we have identified others based on various metrics. Additionally, we continue to narrow our focus on markets where we do not currently operate, with the intention of selecting one to enter organically. In 2013, we opened the first stores under our new capital allocation strategy. It is still early, but we are pleased with their performance to budget and expect these and future stores will greatly support our growth plan.\r\nDuring 2013, Kroger purchased 16.1 million common shares for a total investment of $609 million. Since the end of the fourth quarter and through the close of the market yesterday, Kroger has approximately $18.7 remaining -- $18.7 million remaining under the $500 million stock repurchase program announced in October of 2012.\r\nNow I'd like to outline our specific growth objectives for fiscal 2014. Kroger anticipates identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for fiscal 2014. This range takes into account the expectation of low inflation during the year and includes Harris Teeter.\r\nFull year net earnings for fiscal 2014 are expected to range from $3.14 to $3.25 per diluted share. This guidance includes Harris Teeter. Growing fiscal 2013 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.85 by our long-term growth rate of $0.08 to $0.11 equates to a range of $3.08 to $3.16 per diluted share. We then added the net accretion to earnings from the Harris Teeter merger of $0.06 to $0.09 per diluted share, excluding transition in -- transaction costs, resulting in the 10% to 14% growth rate for fiscal 2014. As you think about early estimates for 2015, we would expect to return to our 8% to 11% long-term growth rate.\r\nAs we report earnings during 2014, we will not break out Harris Teeter results separately, which is consistent with our treatment of all supermarket divisions today. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a growing dividend, and we expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin rate in 2014, excluding fuel, to expand slightly compared to adjusted fiscal 2013 results.\r\nWhen looking at our cadence by quarter, we expect the first, second and fourth quarters to be within the 10% to 14% range and the third quarter to be above it.\r\nNow I will turn it back to Rodney.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Mike. Being part of a growing retailer is exciting for our associates. 7,000 new jobs last year means not just new team members, but opportunities for our current associates to grow and advance as well. \r\nOur business is strong. Our merger with Harris Teeter is going well, and our associates continue to execute our growth strategy. The remarkable consistency of Kroger's performance has shown time and again that serving our customers is serving our shareholders. I can think of no better example than our associates' dynamic response to the severe weather in many of our markets during the fourth quarter. Often, our logistics and distribution teams sped up deliveries to keep stores stocked several days before major storms. Most of our stores remained open even in the worst of the winter weather. In some cases, our associates even welcome stranded travelers in extreme freezing conditions to spend the night in one of our stores. Our customers trust that our -- their neighborhood Kroger will be open and stocked when it matters most, and we couldn't be more proud of the way our associates rose to the occasion.\r\nNow we look forward to your questions. Glenn, you can go ahead and get questions started. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Cindy Holmes (Executives)】\nThank you, Glenn. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.\r\nBefore we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.\r\nBoth our fourth quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] \r\nI will now turn the call over to Rodney McMullen, Chief Executive Officer of Kroger. Rodney?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThank you, Cindy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and full year 2013 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\r\nOur associates continue to execute our accelerated growth plan, resulting in a great quarter and a full year we are proud of. Kroger is delivering on the key performance targets we committed to when we outlined our long-term growth strategy at our October 2012 investor meeting. Mike Schlotman will give more details about each of the 4 metrics, but I'd like to share the highlights. \r\nWe achieved our 41st consecutive quarter of identical supermarket sales growth. We expanded our rolling 4-quarter FIFO operating margin excluding fuel. We improved our return on invested capital even as we increased capital investments, and we increased our market share in 2013.\r\nFor the full year, we continue to perform for shareholders by delivering adjusted earnings per share growth of 13%. We achieved our ninth consecutive year of reducing operating expense as a rate of sales, and we returned 600 -- or $928 million to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. That we accomplished all of this while also successfully completing our merger with Harris Teeter is a great testament to our associates' determined focus on serving our customers. We are confident that 2014 will be a great year and that we will continue to deliver growth that investors can count on.\r\nConsistent with what we've been saying for the last several years, we expect the economic recovery in 2014 to remain fragile and uneven. Things will continue to get better for some customers, while others remain under economic stress, and we are doing all we can to help. For customers focused on their budget, we continue to offer low entry price points on key items, especially in our corporate brands portfolio.\r\nIf you look at our SNAP households during the fourth quarter, they increased their total monthly spending in our stores for each of the 3 months since the benefit reductions took effect compared to the prior year. What we saw play out in the fourth quarter was what we anticipated, that SNAP customers spent more of their own cash on food.\r\nAll of our customers are benefiting from our relentless focus on friendly service and fresh products, including our organic and natural foods and our own unique brands like Simple Truth. We have a lot of room to grow because the overall industry in which we operate in is expanding. We continue to improve our connection with customers across the entire spectrum. Whether value, mainstream or upscale customers, we are competitively positioned to deliver the right value proposition, and our customer insights help us to focus on the right opportunities for growth in each segment, so that we will capture more of the share of the massive food market.\r\nNow I'll turn it over to Mike Ellis to outline our operational performance. Mike?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nThanks, Rodney. Good morning, everyone. We continue to have opportunity with our low customers because on average, we capture $0.50 of every $1 they spend on the products that we sell. This figure has remained steady due to the effect that new households have on this calculation. As we told you in December, our loyal household count has increased by an outstanding 83% over the past decade. We do, however, see incrementally more spending from our mature loyal households.\r\nDuring the fourth quarter, we continue to grow the number of loyal households and at a much faster rate than total household growth, which was also up for the quarter. We continue to improve our friendliness, product freshness, shopping experience and price perception in our customers' eyes. As you know, we closely tracked these 4 keys against our competitors. What we have been tracking internally is consistent with the independent American Customer Satisfaction Index released last month, which reported steady improvement in Kroger customer satisfaction.\r\nInflation was low in the fourth quarter. We expect inflation to be low in 2014 as well, which is reflected in our identical store sales guidance for the year, which Mike Schlotman will talk about shortly. A key driver of growth is our commitment to Customer 1st innovation. As you know, we have done a lot of innovative things over the past couple of years to create unique competitive advantages for Kroger, like our faster checkout initiative. Each quarter, we will highlight one or more innovations that improve our connection with customers and improve our market share. This quarter, I will highlight corporate brands and digital.\r\nCorporate brands continue to be leading differentiator for Kroger. We introduced 937 new products in fiscal 2013, including 100 new Simple Truth items. Simple Truth continues to grow at an astonishing pace, and we now expect it to reach $1 billion brand status by the end of fiscal 2014.\r\nCorporate brands continue to gain market share during the fourth quarter, with corporate brands representing approximately 27.2% of total units sold and 24.4% of our sales dollars, including pharmacy and fuel.\r\nWe recently announced the exciting new acquisition of our digital coupon marketing provider, YOU Technology. We believe that YOU Tech has strong growth potential and will, over time, become the leading digital coupon provider for U.S. retailers, not just Kroger. YOU Tech has helped us reach another digital milestone recently. We began offering digital coupons in early 2010 and within 3 years, our customers had downloaded 500 million digital coupons. Customers download the next 500 million in only 14 months. In fact, at approximately 5:57 p.m. Eastern Time on February 6, a customer downloaded Kroger's 1 billionth digital coupon. It was an exciting moment for us and one that demonstrates the growth and customer acceptance of our digital efforts.\r\nNow I will provide a brief update on labor relations. We're currently negotiating contracts in Cincinnati, Atlanta and Southern California. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for all of our associates. In fact, we added more than 7,000 jobs last year and more than 40,000 jobs over the last 6 years. Those numbers are even larger when you include Harris Teeter's more than 25,000 associates.\r\nNow Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's growth metrics and financial results, as well as our guidance for 2014. Mike?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. We exceeded our expectations for the quarter and the year, thanks to our associates performing to deliver growth. We continue to implement our long-term growth strategy, which includes targeting capital to grow our business in new and existing markets, leveraging customer insights to solve varied customer needs through both traditional and digital channels and continuing our share buyback program. As Rodney mentioned earlier, when we outlined our accelerated growth strategy at our October 2012 investor conference, we also identified 4 key performance targets for shareholders to measure our progress. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the results in each metric.\r\nOur first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter ID sales growth of 4.3%. This strong performance was supported by ID sales growth in every department and every supermarket division. We continue to see outstanding double-digit identical sales growth in our natural foods department. Our produce and deli bakery departments also posted strong ID sales growth, highlighting our customers' continued demand for fresh products. Kroger's pharmacy department continues to outperform as well. Our ID sales results, in light of the slow economic recovery and low inflation throughout the year, are quite remarkable. Weather conditions across much of the country were a net positive as well. Our team's Customer 1st response to weather events kept our stores open and shelf stock, which coupled with our convenient locations, made Kroger more accessible for customers who flock to stores to stock up before winter storms.\r\nFor only 4 quarters adjusted FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and the extra week, increased by 11 basis points compared to the adjusted fiscal 2012 result. This is a result above our commitment to grow the rates slightly over time on a rolling 4 quarters' basis.\r\nThe third target metric is return on invested capital. We reported a return on invested capital, excluding Harris Teeter, on a 52-week rolling 4 quarters' basis of 13.43% compared to 13.42% during the same period last year. As we told you, as we increase capital investments, it will be more difficult to grow ROIC in the near term. However, as these investments mature, we expect them to be accretive to ROIC.\r\nOur fourth target metric is market share growth, which we report on annually. We look at market share the way customers would look at it, where they spend their money. In the past, we use Nielsen Homescan data as our source for market share. We're now using a different Nielsen product, Nielsen POS plus, which includes all point-of-sale data from several competitors and includes all departments inside our stores, except for pharmacy. We believe Nielsen POS plus is a good data -- is a good and consistent source. While POS plus does not include all of our competitors today, it covers -- captures roughly 85% of the items we sell, including most perishable items, which Nielsen Homescan did not include. \r\nAccording to Nielsen POS data, Kroger's overall market share of the products we sell in the markets where we operate grew approximately 50 basis points during 2013. This data also indicates that our share increased in 16 of the 18 markets outlined by the Nielsen Report and was down slightly in 2 markets. \r\nWalmart supercenters are 1 of our top 2 competitors in 13 of the 18 markets outlined in the Nielsen report. Kroger increased share in 12 of those markets and declined slightly in 1. The Nielsen POS data is generated by real retailers who report their sales to Nielsen. This includes food, drug, mass and dollar channels. This does not include C-store and club.\r\nNow I'll share our fourth quarter results and fiscal 2013 results. Please note that Harris Teeter is included in the company's ending balance sheet, but because of the timing late in the year, it had no effect on our adjusted fourth quarter or fiscal 2013 earnings. If you remember last year, we gave you details to better understand how our core business performed. This year, we have similarly outlined our adjustments for fiscal 2013 and 2012 in Table 6 of our earnings release. The following results are all adjusted as outlined in Table 6 and exclude the effect of the 53rd week last year.\r\nIn the fourth quarter, our net earnings totaled $421.9 million or $0.81 per diluted share. Excluding the items outlined in Table 6, Kroger's adjusted net earnings per diluted share grew 10% to $0.78 in the fourth quarter. We recorded a $9.7 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to $41.2 million credit in the same quarter last year. FIFO gross margin increased 11 basis points from the same period last year excluding retail fuel operations.\r\nOperating, general and administrative costs plus rent and depreciation, excluding retail fuel operations, declined 16 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the prior year's adjusted fourth quarter.\r\nBefore I move on to discuss Kroger's full year 2013 results, I'll share some data on our retail fuel operations. About half of our supermarkets have fuel centers today. In the fourth quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.113 compared to $0.13 in the same quarter last year, after adjusting for the additional week. For the full year, the cents per gallon fuel margin was roughly $0.141 compared with $0.14 last year, again, after adjusting for the additional week.\r\nTurning now to full year 2013 results, Kroger reported total sales of $98.4 billion in fiscal 2013, an increase of 3.9% after adjusting for the extra week last year. On this basis, and excluding fuel, total sales increased 4.2% over the prior year. Identical supermarket sales without fuel increased 3.6% in fiscal 2013 compared with the prior year. Net earnings for fiscal 2013 totaled $1.52 billion or $2.90 per diluted share, adjusted net earnings of $1.5 billion or $2.85 per share, a growth of 13%.\r\nKroger's LIFO charge for fiscal 2013 was comparable to fiscal 2012. Strong identical sales and cost controls allowed Kroger to leverage operating expenses as a rate of sales for the ninth consecutive year. In fiscal 2013, OG&A costs plus rent and depreciation without fuel and the extra week were down 24 basis points.\r\nFor 2014, our planned uses of cash remain unchanged, maintain our current investment-grade debt rating, repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend and fund increasing capital investments. Net total debt was $10.9 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion from a year ago as a result of the Harris Teeter transaction and due to the timing late in our fiscal year, we realized no incremental EBITDA in 2013 from this transaction. Therefore, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.43 compared to 2.04 during the same period last year.\r\nKroger remains committed to managing its free cash flow to achieve a 2 to 2.2x net total debt to EBITDA ratio over the next 18 to 24 months. \r\nCapital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities, totaled $2.3 billion for the year compared to $2 billion for 2012. For 2014, we expect capital investments to be in the $2.8 billion to $3 billion range, including Harris Teeter. As you know, part of our long-term growth strategy is to increase capital investments over time. This will take the form of adding square footage in markets where we believe our business model is already resonating with customers. With a better presence, we can grow our market share and return on invested capital.

It is still early, but we are pleased with their performance to budget and expect these and future stores will greatly support our growth plan.\r\nDuring 2013, Kroger purchased 16.1 million common shares for a total investment of $609 million. Since the end of the fourth quarter and through the close of the market yesterday, Kroger has approximately $18.7 remaining -- $18.7 million remaining under the $500 million stock repurchase program announced in October of 2012.\r\nNow I'd like to outline our specific growth objectives for fiscal 2014. Kroger anticipates identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for fiscal 2014. This range takes into account the expectation of low inflation during the year and includes Harris Teeter.\r\nFull year net earnings for fiscal 2014 are expected to range from $3.14 to $3.25 per diluted share. This guidance includes Harris Teeter. Growing fiscal 2013 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.85 by our long-term growth rate of $0.08 to $0.11 equates to a range of $3.08 to $3.16 per diluted share. We then added the net accretion to earnings from the Harris Teeter merger of $0.06 to $0.09 per diluted share, excluding transition in -- transaction costs, resulting in the 10% to 14% growth rate for fiscal 2014. As you think about early estimates for 2015, we would expect to return to our 8% to 11% long-term growth rate.\r\nAs we report earnings during 2014, we will not break out Harris Teeter results separately, which is consistent with our treatment of all supermarket divisions today. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a growing dividend, and we expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin rate in 2014, excluding fuel, to expand slightly compared to adjusted fiscal 2013 results.\r\nWhen looking at our cadence by quarter, we expect the first, second and fourth quarters to be within the 10% to 14% range and the third quarter to be above it.\r\nNow I will turn it back to Rodney.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThanks, Mike. Being part of a growing retailer is exciting for our associates. 7,000 new jobs last year means not just new team members, but opportunities for our current associates to grow and advance as well. \r\nOur business is strong. Our merger with Harris Teeter is going well, and our associates continue to execute our growth strategy.

Our customers trust that our -- their neighborhood Kroger will be open and stocked when it matters most, and we couldn't be more proud of the way our associates rose to the occasion.\r\nNow we look forward to your questions. Glenn, you can go ahead and get questions started. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text3": "I just wanted to start with a strategic question. You provided the market share performance and how you do against supercenters. I'm curious, how many neighborhood markets are you against today and what has the experience there been? And how do you think about competitively addressing that format, right, which is basically a supermarket format versus a supercenter?\n\n---\n\nIn terms of the specific numbers, I wouldn't have those. I don't know, Mike or Mike, if you have the specific numbers? Obviously, we have a lot of respect for everybody that we compete against. We would not look at a neighborhood store much different than a supercenter. And what we're really focused on is, obviously, our customer and serving our customers and making sure that we continue to improve the value, but we really don't see the effect much different. Part of it will depend on how close that neighborhood store is to a Walmart -- prior Walmart store as well, affected as well. And then, Mike, anything you want to add?\n\n---\n\nWell, we know that there's significant capital being allocated to the neighborhood markets, but as Rodney mentioned, one of our advantages really is our location. We're located within 2 miles of so many of our customers that and convenience and the variety that we offer, we feel comfortable where we're at today.\n\n---\n\nAnd we don't know -- I mean, in the markets we -- over last week with supercenter and your gain in share, you don't know where that's coming from. So that could be coming from -- even a lot of that could be coming from fallout among traditional food retailers?\n\n---\n\nThat's correct, John. And we -- also, if you look at some of the additions that we're doing with natural foods, organic, things like that, so some of the gain in share would be that as well. So it's not just only other traditional supermarkets.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then, well, lastly, what do you think the impact is, in totality, right, the good and bad impact from ACA this year?\n\n---\n\nI was -- we were looking at each other. When you look at '14, we really don't think at the end of the day it'll have a huge amount of effect in '14. Obviously, over time, it will have an increasing -- increasingly amount of effect. Whether that's a net positive or a negative, I think it's way too early, because obviously, on some pieces of it, it's a positive because it expands people's access to health care, which in our pharmacy business and our health care business is a positive. So I think it's way too early to tell you one thing or the other. We're working really hard to make sure that we try to minimize the effect on our associates as we transition to the new plans.\n\n---\n\nI actually quickly like to follow up just on what you were talking about now, just to confirm that when you talk about the impact on your associates, it's only the nonunionized associates you're talking about, right?\n\n---\n\nNo. I mean, obviously, with the union plans, we will partner with the union and try to make sure that we minimize that effect, but it's much broader than just only our own health care plans.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then I just want to switch gears and talk about -- I know that you're investing a fair amount of money in North Texas, and that it does include not just building facility stores, but also lowering prices. And I was just wondering if you could talk more broadly about your strategy. I think this is an indication of the -- things you were talking about more broadly, but I wanted -- I just want to talk about why that market and how it's going and what is the new response to lower prices?\n\n---\n\nIf you look at the strategy itself, there would be lots of markets that we would have similar strategies in. It just happens that this one has a little -- it's a little higher profile than some of the others, and why that happens is always hard to say. As you know, overall, we remain committed to slightly improving our operating margins. And as we take costs out of the business, we partner with dunnhumby and figure out a way to give that lower cost back to the customers in ways that matter. And as you know, that's been our strategy for many years, and we continue to do that. And if you look at the things that we're doing in fourth -- that we did in '13, the things we're doing in '14, we're very pleased with the results we're getting, just like we have been for the last several years. I don't know, Mike or Mike, do you want to add anything?\n\n---\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that actually clarifies things somewhat. And then I'm going to ask a tough question, and I'm not even sure I should ask it. But would you do anything in the world of M&A that would substantially change your balance sheet or the tasks that you have to accomplish in the next couple of years?\n\n---\n\nIt's an interesting way to ask the elephant-in-the-room question, Meredith.\n\n---\n\nI try to be interesting all the time.\n\n---\n\nIt just doesn't do us any good to comment on potential activity that's out there, so we'll just take the stance of no comment on M&A activity.\n\n---\n\nThat's one of the things. Meredith, the only thing I would add is just remember the model that we've outlined in terms of growing our business for our shareholders doesn't require any type of mergers to achieve. And if you think about the merger with Harris Teeter, the benefit that, that brought to our company, we actually increased the growth rate from the first year. In terms of specifics, I'm not going to get into any specifics.\n\n---\n\nMeredith, you took my question. So I actually wanted to go to gross margins and a lot of our work is showing you guys priced very aggressively on some of these fast-turning items, probably more aggressively than we've ever seen you. Yet your FIFO gross margins are probably better than we would've expected and continue to push in the right direction. How are you doing this? I mean, one side of it, you're taking huge share, pricing is very aggressive. But on the other side, it seems like you've got some secret sauce here. And I just wanted to have any comments on how you're able to do this.\n\n---\n\nThe fourth quarter was a little different than everybody had seen and has expected from us. Clearly, pharmacy that we talked about in the prepared comments had a very strong year and was a good contributor to gross margin. It had a nice gross margin increase. Our mix in the fourth quarter was very strong. When you look at just gross margin, obviously, a lot of those fresh categories have a little bit higher overall margin than some of the center-of-the-store categories, so that mix can help. And certainly, the snow helped, as we made the comments on people coming in to stock up before weather events. Typically, when people go on a normal shopping trip, they shop off of their lists. When they come in to stock up before an event like that, they come in to stock up before an event like that, and they aren't really beholden to a list at that point in time. So I would say those 3 were the main drivers of what we saw in the fourth quarter, not necessarily something that's going to continue out into the future.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Then I -- one other question about the guidance. I noticed -- I think you're down pretty low on your repurchase authorization. I think, Mike, you said about $18 million or something or $18 million, $19 million left. How much of the guidance of repurchase activity is contemplated in that guidance? I mean, should we expect a change, I mean, you're -- like you're almost done?\n\n---\n\nYes, a couple things on repurchase activity. We've been a regular buyer of our shares since January of 2000. There have been a few times when we've been out in the market, and most notably, around the White House work stoppage and then when we were blacked out as a result of the Harris Teeter negotiations. But other than that, we've generally been in the market almost all of the time and I would expect going into the future, we would continue to be in the market. Obviously, I don't have a lot of money left to do that with and our guidance, as we just talked about back in October of '12, in the early years of that growth model, it is an important contributor to our earnings per share growth, until those stores, as we talked about coming out of the ground beginning in 2013 start to mature, we will rely on some share buyback activity. To get any more specific than that -- I'm not going to go any more specific.\n\n---\n\nSo there is some of that contemplated in the guidance you put out?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nGreat. I have 2 questions, let me try and attack the elephant a bit differently. Can you remind us in general what your requirements are or what attributes you look for when you do M&A? And my impression has been that you're not necessarily interested in what I would call turnaround stories that needs some price investment, but you'd rather buy a ready-to-wear asset like Harris Teeter. Is that a fair judgment still? Would you theoretically look at stores that need a little TLC if the price is attractive enough? Just on a general basis.\n\n---\n\nWell, even when you look at -- let's just talk about the Harris Teeter transaction. The thing that was attractive about Harris Teeter as a transaction is that it's a well-run company that overall we admired a whole lot. That's not to say -- you only picked off price as an attribute that might need some TLC. What we have not liked over time is poorly run companies, not just one attribute of the company that might have an issue.\n\n---\n\nThat's helpful. Can you maybe just add a little color on what poorly run means to you?\n\n---\n\nWe're getting close to just -- to asking the question. Poorly run just -- results aren't strong, cash flow is not strong, pick the attributes.\n\n---\n\nOkay, I hear you. And then other question, can you talk a little bit about how happy you are with center store performance in general? And the reason I'm asking is the shelf's stable numbers that we're seeing from the manufacturing side, just very sluggish across the board except natural and organic and yet we're seeing specialty groceries, right, that focus on fresh, prepared, et cetera, do pretty well across the board. I walked down the aisles of Kroger and Safeway and SUPERVALU banners and I see a lot of meaningful space still being given to cereal, soup and categories in decline. I'm just wondering how long can that last, right? What would it take for you to take a more dramatic change to your in-store footprint, right, so you can replace some of that dry grocery shelving with some room for fresh, prepared, et cetera?\n\n---\n\nWell, the core of our business is still a big part of our business. And when we look at space allocation, especially in some of our new stores, you'll find that we are allocating more and more space to perishable, refrigerated and the categories that the customer really cares about. The customer is telling us that's what they're interested in, but we can't ignore the center store and health and beauty care products and grocery that are still a big, big part of our business. But we constantly look at space allocation and make adjustments based on what the customer is telling us they want.\n\n---\n\nOkay, so no plans to sort of accelerate that shift in space?\n\n---\n\nNo, I think we're constantly looking at this, the allocation and making changes. If you get into our new stores, I believe you'll see some changes in mix.\n\n---\n\nI just had a few quick follow-ups. First, I just want to clarify, and you guys have probably explained it more than once, but so the SNAP reductions are actually supporting market share gains for you? Is that fair to say?\n\n---\n\nWell, I wouldn't say it that way. What we're seeing is our SNAP customers continue to spend more money with us, and what they're doing is substituting SNAP dollars with their own cash or on debit or credit card. We believe -- if you look, overall, fuel prices are down to even, depending on what part of the period you're looking at. So we believe some of that has been funded by our SNAP customers spending less in other places and reallocating dollars. So I wouldn't make the direct connection the way you did. We're really focused on how do we make sure that we're giving the best value we can to that customer, along with all our other customers, and they're rewarding us by spending more money with us.\n\n---\n\nGot you. That's great. Second follow-up question, which is the weather and stock-up, any -- did you guys take a guess at quantifying how much that might have helped comps in the fourth quarter in gross margin?\n\n---\n\nIt's really difficult to say. When you look at weeks like that, clearly, it's a net positive when it winds up happening. But you have days that are up double the prior year and then you have a couple days after that, that are down significantly from the prior year. So it gets very, very choppy. Clearly, with the help, and as I said in the prepared comments or I said earlier in the -- to the gross profit question, the mix during those shops helps the gross profit rate because people come in, really, not with the list like they'd normally do, but they come in to have things deep for the next couple of days.\n\n---\n\nRobbie, overall, was -- it was helpful, but we did -- when you look at the 2004 expectations, we grew that off of the actual '13, excluding any unusual items. So we did not adjust out that -- any weather benefit. But overall, we do think it was a net positive.\n\n---\n\nGot you. And then last question, I'll let you guys move to the next. Harris Teeter, I'm a personal fan of. I shop there when I'm down south. And is there any other -- you guys have talked about some of the things they do well that you might be able to bring into The Kroger store base. Anything since we last did a conference call that you can update us on?\n\n---\n\nRobbie, it's -- the merger ultimately closed January 28. So it's only been a handful of weeks since we've actually been able to roll up our sleeves and have the kind of conversations you want to have when you start integrating a company. That said, we've made a lot of progress in those 6 or so weeks since the merger's been closed. Clearly, one of the things we like is that about -- a little over 160 of their stores, they have what -- it's called Express Lane, we call it click and collect. That's something that intrigues us as -- it's an internet but pick-it-up yourself kind of a process at the store that appears to appeal very strongly to their customer. That's something we'll try to learn from. But it's been a very positive and we're very happy with the start we've had to the integration progress with Harris Teeter. And any surprise that we've seen has been a positive, not a negative surprise, which is always nice.\n\n---\n\nSo my question is with the Harris Teeter acquisition, it kind of brought you back into the M&A market where you've been absent for a number of years. And I know you can't comment on market rumors, but internally, has there been any sort of shift or change in the way that you'd look at M&A opportunities?\n\n---\n\nNo, I'd say it's consistent with how we've always done it. And also, as I said in my prepared comments, our investment-grade rating is important to us and we continue to expect to allocate free cash flow to maintain our rating.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And I think with the Harris Teeter acquisition, you sort of temporarily went above that 2 to 2.2x net leverage target. I mean, how much flex do you feel like you have within the investment-grade rating band? And would you be able -- or would you be willing to even go maybe a little bit higher than that for the right strategic opportunity?\n\n---\n\nYes -- I'm not going to comment on that. And obviously, the only reason -- the reason we're above the 2.2x on Harris Teeter is the shareholders won't wait a year to get their check for the purchase of their shares. They want that upfront. We don't get a year's worth of EBITDA until the end of the year. So it's really just the fact we have all the debt and none of the EBITDA now, and we feel very good about our ability to get back under 2.2x in the time frame we outlined to the rating agencies.\n\n---\n\nA couple of questions just on your guidance. What is your -- in guidance, specifically. What is your guidance and planned D&A, as well as interest expense? It seems like -- I mean, we can kind of calculate interest expense or incremental interest expense related to Harris Teeter, but D&A was a little bit of a wildcard. So any color there?\n\n---\n\nObviously, from the write-off of the assets for Harris Teeter, the amortization of that will pick up. I don't have that in front of me, and I prefer not to go giving guidance on every line of the income statement. I might as well just hand you my business plan and let the whole world have it, which I think we give as much or more guidance than anyone. So you should be able to back into it just based on the public guidance we've given of what our earnings per share is and the number of lines we've given you.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then looking at your MEPP guidance for 2014, I think it reflects kind of an 11% increase in the expense. Any color on why that increase is so high. That just seems high to me.\n\n---\n\nThe contributions into the plan?\n\n---\n\nYes, the $250 million?\n\n---\n\nIt's just our expectation. There are some funds in rehab status that -- one of the ways you get out of rehab status is you put a little bit more money in, benefits come down a little bit and over time, it's an attempt to try to get them in a better funded position. It's -- while the percentage is fairly strong, it's not that much incremental cash that we're expecting next year.\n\n---\n\nAnd it would be something that we'll work with the unions on to make sure that we try to get those funds in a status that's sustainable over time. And it would be an ongoing negotiation and relationship in terms of the balance between what money we spend on pension, what money we spend on health care and what we're able to do on wages. So it's really all together.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And just on your investment-grade ratings, getting back to that 2x to 2.2x, I guess what I'm confused about is why wouldn't they be looking at the pro forma number regardless in terms of your investment-grade rating [indiscernible] they are?\n\n---\n\nYes, I believe the rating agencies do that, which is why they did not downgrade us when we announced the merger. Obviously, the conversations were -- with them were our commitment to get it back down there based on a pro forma calculation you do for them, and that's what they got comfortable with. So from the rating agency standpoint, they would look at it that way. But from the number I have to report, my number is my number.\n\n---\n\nCould you touch on a couple of categories in particular about how they did during the quarter, one would be general merchandise, especially at Fred Meyer and then prepared foods, please?\n\n---\n\nYes, general merchandise, it was such an interesting holiday season with 6 less selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. And predicting our business and building our business plan around that was certainly -- it doesn't happen very often. But overall, the season came out pretty decent. It wasn't as different as we would've thought it would've been. I think we actually came out okay when you figure the changes in by Friday, the differences in the calendar and everything else that occurred. And so in general, I would say it came out okay. Jewelry, for example, for us, had a really stellar quarter, and general merchandise was fairly decent. I mean, I would say it came out okay. But in terms of -- what was the other question, prepared food?\n\n---\n\nYes -- and overall, it turned out better than we were expecting when you think about 6 less days and the economy and especially some of the weather in parts of the countries. But overall, we felt pretty good about it, prepared goods. Go ahead, Mike.\n\n---\n\nPrepared foods continue to be a growing section of our business for us, so we're committing more and more space and better products all the time to those types of departments and items. So I wouldn't say there's anything really unusual when it comes to prepared food.\n\n---\n\nAll right. And finally, can you give us an update on sales trends, thus far, into the first quarter?\n\n---\n\nObviously, it's very early in the quarter. Right now, we would be a little bit better than the high side of the range, but it's still very early, and we believe the weather has been a positive so far. As we've mentioned, as Mike mentioned in the prepared remarks, when you look at the year as a whole, we expect inflation to be reasonably modest throughout the whole year. But so far, so good.\n\n---\n\nYou did mention the innovation in digital on the YOU Tech acquisition. So can you actually maybe describe some of the synergies that come from that acquisition, what they are maybe bringing to the table that you didn't have already and just the contribution you're expecting there over the next, call it, 5 years?\n\n---\n\nWell, I'm not really so sure I can comment on synergies, but we do like what YOU Tech brings to us in terms of the technology and our ability to serve up coupons for our customers in a really meaningful way. And you couple that with dunnhumby, and we think that this really gives us a great platform to communicate better with our customer and provide them both technology and the coupons that they're looking for today. Because a customer can redeem coupons simply by taking their loyalty card into the store and scanning it, and they're receiving the things they want most and getting discounts on those items.\n\n---\n\nWhen I said synergies, I guess, I meant qualitatively. And I guess, the follow-up would be, as you look at developing this yourself versus making this acquisition, is this just the way to jumpstart moving to maybe even integrating some of the customized coupons to the customer?\n\n---\n\nYes, well, it certainly helped us move faster. And the relationship with YOU Technology has moved us along a lot quicker than we probably would've done on our own.\n\n---\n\nYes, there's multiple levels to it, Stephen. When you talk about customized coupons, today, all of the digital coupons that are out there, there's a sort feature on The Kroger app that allows you to sort those coupons based on the relevance to you of how you shop and what you buy. So rather than having to search through all the coupons that might be attractive, the app basically does that for you based on how you actually buy product.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then I have a quick follow-up to I think it was Ken's question. And you had mentioned last quarter that you would expect the margin on natural organic items to converge over time with conventional. And as I think initially, it may have been viewed as maybe reduction in margin on those items, but given the consolidation in the space and your reallocation of the natural organic to be a little bit greater versus the center store, is there any reason to see the margin maybe even go up on the conventional items over time?\n\n---\n\nIt's a good question. I think it's pretty hard to say. We would not expect that as a general rule and we're really focused on figuring out ways to give the customer better and better deal.\n\n---\n\nSo Cerberus is one of the parties reportedly looking at Safeway. If you look at their behavior after their acquisition of the Supervalu banners, would you say they were more or less disciplined on price? And how is their behavior in the marketplace as a competitor after the move there?\n\n---\n\nObviously, in terms of a lot of specifics, we won't be able to give you that. But we look at Cerberus and Albertsons as a very good competitor, and we're really focused on what does our customer want and then how do we get better about delivering against that. They're a good competitor, but there's a lot of good competitors out there. So probably a little more focused on the basics every day, but I wouldn't say it's appreciable different.\n\n---\n\nOkay, so you didn't see any C-change in pricing strategy or anything like that as they shifted there?\n\n---\n\nNo, not to the extent that you would think. It was a completely different person before. They do a better job on the basics. They also will consolidate stores. They ended up selling off some stores, things like that, but it's -- every transaction is different.\n\n---\n\nJust looking at cash flow for 2014, can you tell us after the Harris Teeter acquisition, whether or not you expect working capital to be either a use or a source of cash? And can you give us kind of an order of magnitude?\n\n---\n\nYes, we continue to do a really good job on our working capital usage. If you look at the consolidated balance sheet, the way we look at it, and it's the balance sheet with Harris Teeter combined into it. We had just about $75 million or $80 million reduction in working capital overall for the year and we still have plans in place of things that we think could continue to improve that. We wouldn't budget in dramatic improvements and have that in expectation of as a source of cash, but we would expect to have some benefit from it.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And then I think you also indicated that you expect to contribute about $250 million to the multiemployer pension plans this year, and I assume that includes Harris Teeter. Can you confirm that? And can you tell us if there are multiemployer pension -- I guess, obligations were materially larger than your overall obligations?\n\n---\n\nHarris Teeter is not a party or not a member of any of the multiemployer funds. They're 100% employee choice. So I guess, that would be total company, the contributions, but none of it has reflected the result of the merger with Harris Teeter.\n\n---\n\nMike, my question for you is on CapEx. I don't think it was asked. But your guidance, Mike, looks like it calls for about, I don't know, maybe a $600 million increase in CapEx. I think Harris Teeter, based on what they've shown historically, could be a couple hundred of that. And you know what, obviously, your longer-term guidance was an additional $200 million a year. So could you just kind of help us understand where the increase in CapEx is coming from?\n\n---\n\nSure. If you go back to our December call, we were projecting a point estimate of $2.4 billion for this year. We came in at $2.3 billion. Some of that is just a little delay on some projects that caused it to be a little behind where we expect it. We would expect that catch-up to happen in 2014. So if you think about 2014 going off of a $2.4 billion base, the $200 million increase that we would've expected on an annual basis would get you to $2.6 billion. And then adding in the activity for Harris Teeter, which will probably be a little higher than the number you used, may continue to have some attractive opportunities and their own forecast would have had their CapEx continuing to grow because they were growing their company. That's really how we got the build up to $2.8 billion to $3 billion.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then as we think about sort of beyond this maybe like '15, I -- we probably shouldn't throw $200 million on top of '14 number because of the catch-up, I guess, is how to think about it.\n\n---\n\nIt's a little early to give 2015 guidance, but for planning purposes at this point, I would be thinking about another $200 million internally.\n\n---\n\nAnd Ed, the thing we're really focused on, and Mike mentioned it in his prepared comments, is the incremental capital we're spending, what returns are we getting for that and what's our ability to execute at that higher level because obviously it creates jobs and we have to find associates to staff those stores and run those stores. And as long as we're feeling good about being able to help develop our associates to run the stores and their performance continues to be strong, we would continue to expect to continue to increase capital.\n\n---\n\nAnd as we said, we're coming close to picking a market to go into organically, which will take some capital as well.\n\n---\n\nAnd just a follow-up on that, Mike and Rodney, when you think about a new market, what are the dynamics that you're really sort of looking for to make that decision in terms of where you ultimately go?\n\n---\n\nWell, we look at a wide range of topics, including the competitive landscape. We look at where the market may be situated compared to our existing infrastructure. It would be very nice if it winds up being a market that our current logistics and manufacturing systems can supply product to them, again, the dynamics of the market, not just the competitive landscape, but the growth that you see in a potential market. And then some customer research of what it is the customer wants from a grocery retailer and how we have been able to perform against that over time in the markets where we already operate. So it's a very long list of things. Those would be amongst the bigger.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Glenn. Before we end the call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. First, I'd like to welcome our Harris Teeter associates to The Kroger family. We couldn't be happier. I'd also like to thank our associates for your hard work in connection with our customers. We finished 2013 strong because of your hard work to provide friendly service and fresh products to every customer every time, every day. You also helped keep costs under control so we can reinvest the savings in things that matter most to our customers. They are taking note of your efforts and giving us credit for making a difference. Special thanks to each and every one of you for all you do for our customers and each other.\r\nThis week, we will host our third annual associate recognition event in Cincinnati. Our 33 associate honorees come from across the company, including our retail divisions, fee stores, manufacturing and logistics facilities, Fred Meyer Jewelry, the Little Clinic and general office. They will be recognized during this 2-day event for their friendly service, strong leadership, dedication to their community and courage in the fight against cancer. \r\nFinally, I'd like to say thank you to our Chairman, Dave Dillon, for his leadership and the powerful foundation he and our team have put in place. I am humbled to be serving as your CEO and excited to work with our outstanding leadership team. We're not done serving our customers, growing our business and performing for shareholders. Indeed, we're just getting started. That completes our call for today. Thanks for joining us, and thank you for all you do to partner with Kroger.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nI just wanted to start with a strategic question. You provided the market share performance and how you do against supercenters. I'm curious, how many neighborhood markets are you against today and what has the experience there been? And how do you think about competitively addressing that format, right, which is basically a supermarket format versus a supercenter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nIn terms of the specific numbers, I wouldn't have those. I don't know, Mike or Mike, if you have the specific numbers? Obviously, we have a lot of respect for everybody that we compete against. We would not look at a neighborhood store much different than a supercenter. And what we're really focused on is, obviously, our customer and serving our customers and making sure that we continue to improve the value, but we really don't see the effect much different. Part of it will depend on how close that neighborhood store is to a Walmart -- prior Walmart store as well, affected as well. And then, Mike, anything you want to add?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nWell, we know that there's significant capital being allocated to the neighborhood markets, but as Rodney mentioned, one of our advantages really is our location. We're located within 2 miles of so many of our customers that and convenience and the variety that we offer, we feel comfortable where we're at today.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nAnd we don't know -- I mean, in the markets we -- over last week with supercenter and your gain in share, you don't know where that's coming from. So that could be coming from -- even a lot of that could be coming from fallout among traditional food retailers?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThat's correct, John. And we -- also, if you look at some of the additions that we're doing with natural foods, organic, things like that, so some of the gain in share would be that as well. So it's not just only other traditional supermarkets.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then, well, lastly, what do you think the impact is, in totality, right, the good and bad impact from ACA this year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nI was -- we were looking at each other. When you look at '14, we really don't think at the end of the day it'll have a huge amount of effect in '14. Obviously, over time, it will have an increasing -- increasingly amount of effect. Whether that's a net positive or a negative, I think it's way too early, because obviously, on some pieces of it, it's a positive because it expands people's access to health care, which in our pharmacy business and our health care business is a positive. So I think it's way too early to tell you one thing or the other. We're working really hard to make sure that we try to minimize the effect on our associates as we transition to the new plans.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nI actually quickly like to follow up just on what you were talking about now, just to confirm that when you talk about the impact on your associates, it's only the nonunionized associates you're talking about, right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nNo. I mean, obviously, with the union plans, we will partner with the union and try to make sure that we minimize that effect, but it's much broader than just only our own health care plans.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then I just want to switch gears and talk about -- I know that you're investing a fair amount of money in North Texas, and that it does include not just building facility stores, but also lowering prices. And I was just wondering if you could talk more broadly about your strategy. I think this is an indication of the -- things you were talking about more broadly, but I wanted -- I just want to talk about why that market and how it's going and what is the new response to lower prices?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nIf you look at the strategy itself, there would be lots of markets that we would have similar strategies in. It just happens that this one has a little -- it's a little higher profile than some of the others, and why that happens is always hard to say. As you know, overall, we remain committed to slightly improving our operating margins. And as we take costs out of the business, we partner with dunnhumby and figure out a way to give that lower cost back to the customers in ways that matter. And as you know, that's been our strategy for many years, and we continue to do that. And if you look at the things that we're doing in fourth -- that we did in '13, the things we're doing in '14, we're very pleased with the results we're getting, just like we have been for the last several years. I don't know, Mike or Mike, do you want to add anything?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nNo.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nNo.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nOkay, that actually clarifies things somewhat. And then I'm going to ask a tough question, and I'm not even sure I should ask it. But would you do anything in the world of M&A that would substantially change your balance sheet or the tasks that you have to accomplish in the next couple of years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nIt's an interesting way to ask the elephant-in-the-room question, Meredith.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nI try to be interesting all the time.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nIt just doesn't do us any good to comment on potential activity that's out there, so we'll just take the stance of no comment on M&A activity.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThat's one of the things. Meredith, the only thing I would add is just remember the model that we've outlined in terms of growing our business for our shareholders doesn't require any type of mergers to achieve. And if you think about the merger with Harris Teeter, the benefit that, that brought to our company, we actually increased the growth rate from the first year. In terms of specifics, I'm not going to get into any specifics.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nMeredith, you took my question. So I actually wanted to go to gross margins and a lot of our work is showing you guys priced very aggressively on some of these fast-turning items, probably more aggressively than we've ever seen you. Yet your FIFO gross margins are probably better than we would've expected and continue to push in the right direction. How are you doing this? I mean, one side of it, you're taking huge share, pricing is very aggressive. But on the other side, it seems like you've got some secret sauce here. And I just wanted to have any comments on how you're able to do this.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nThe fourth quarter was a little different than everybody had seen and has expected from us. Clearly, pharmacy that we talked about in the prepared comments had a very strong year and was a good contributor to gross margin. It had a nice gross margin increase. Our mix in the fourth quarter was very strong. When you look at just gross margin, obviously, a lot of those fresh categories have a little bit higher overall margin than some of the center-of-the-store categories, so that mix can help. And certainly, the snow helped, as we made the comments on people coming in to stock up before weather events. Typically, when people go on a normal shopping trip, they shop off of their lists. When they come in to stock up before an event like that, they come in to stock up before an event like that, and they aren't really beholden to a list at that point in time. So I would say those 3 were the main drivers of what we saw in the fourth quarter, not necessarily something that's going to continue out into the future.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nOkay. Then I -- one other question about the guidance. I noticed -- I think you're down pretty low on your repurchase authorization. I think, Mike, you said about $18 million or something or $18 million, $19 million left. How much of the guidance of repurchase activity is contemplated in that guidance? I mean, should we expect a change, I mean, you're -- like you're almost done?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, a couple things on repurchase activity. We've been a regular buyer of our shares since January of 2000. There have been a few times when we've been out in the market, and most notably, around the White House work stoppage and then when we were blacked out as a result of the Harris Teeter negotiations. But other than that, we've generally been in the market almost all of the time and I would expect going into the future, we would continue to be in the market. Obviously, I don't have a lot of money left to do that with and our guidance, as we just talked about back in October of '12, in the early years of that growth model, it is an important contributor to our earnings per share growth, until those stores, as we talked about coming out of the ground beginning in 2013 start to mature, we will rely on some share buyback activity. To get any more specific than that -- I'm not going to go any more specific.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nSo there is some of that contemplated in the guidance you put out?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenneth Goldman (Analysts)】\nGreat. I have 2 questions, let me try and attack the elephant a bit differently. Can you remind us in general what your requirements are or what attributes you look for when you do M&A? And my impression has been that you're not necessarily interested in what I would call turnaround stories that needs some price investment, but you'd rather buy a ready-to-wear asset like Harris Teeter. Is that a fair judgment still? Would you theoretically look at stores that need a little TLC if the price is attractive enough? Just on a general basis.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWell, even when you look at -- let's just talk about the Harris Teeter transaction. The thing that was attractive about Harris Teeter as a transaction is that it's a well-run company that overall we admired a whole lot. That's not to say -- you only picked off price as an attribute that might need some TLC. What we have not liked over time is poorly run companies, not just one attribute of the company that might have an issue.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenneth Goldman (Analysts)】\nThat's helpful. Can you maybe just add a little color on what poorly run means to you?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWe're getting close to just -- to asking the question. Poorly run just -- results aren't strong, cash flow is not strong, pick the attributes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenneth Goldman (Analysts)】\nOkay, I hear you. And then other question, can you talk a little bit about how happy you are with center store performance in general? And the reason I'm asking is the shelf's stable numbers that we're seeing from the manufacturing side, just very sluggish across the board except natural and organic and yet we're seeing specialty groceries, right, that focus on fresh, prepared, et cetera, do pretty well across the board. I walked down the aisles of Kroger and Safeway and SUPERVALU banners and I see a lot of meaningful space still being given to cereal, soup and categories in decline. I'm just wondering how long can that last, right? What would it take for you to take a more dramatic change to your in-store footprint, right, so you can replace some of that dry grocery shelving with some room for fresh, prepared, et cetera?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWell, the core of our business is still a big part of our business. And when we look at space allocation, especially in some of our new stores, you'll find that we are allocating more and more space to perishable, refrigerated and the categories that the customer really cares about. The customer is telling us that's what they're interested in, but we can't ignore the center store and health and beauty care products and grocery that are still a big, big part of our business. But we constantly look at space allocation and make adjustments based on what the customer is telling us they want.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenneth Goldman (Analysts)】\nOkay, so no plans to sort of accelerate that shift in space?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nNo, I think we're constantly looking at this, the allocation and making changes. If you get into our new stores, I believe you'll see some changes in mix.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nI just had a few quick follow-ups. First, I just want to clarify, and you guys have probably explained it more than once, but so the SNAP reductions are actually supporting market share gains for you? Is that fair to say?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, I wouldn't say it that way. What we're seeing is our SNAP customers continue to spend more money with us, and what they're doing is substituting SNAP dollars with their own cash or on debit or credit card. We believe -- if you look, overall, fuel prices are down to even, depending on what part of the period you're looking at. So we believe some of that has been funded by our SNAP customers spending less in other places and reallocating dollars. So I wouldn't make the direct connection the way you did. We're really focused on how do we make sure that we're giving the best value we can to that customer, along with all our other customers, and they're rewarding us by spending more money with us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nGot you. That's great. Second follow-up question, which is the weather and stock-up, any -- did you guys take a guess at quantifying how much that might have helped comps in the fourth quarter in gross margin?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nIt's really difficult to say. When you look at weeks like that, clearly, it's a net positive when it winds up happening. But you have days that are up double the prior year and then you have a couple days after that, that are down significantly from the prior year. So it gets very, very choppy. Clearly, with the help, and as I said in the prepared comments or I said earlier in the -- to the gross profit question, the mix during those shops helps the gross profit rate because people come in, really, not with the list like they'd normally do, but they come in to have things deep for the next couple of days.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nRobbie, overall, was -- it was helpful, but we did -- when you look at the 2004 expectations, we grew that off of the actual '13, excluding any unusual items. So we did not adjust out that -- any weather benefit. But overall, we do think it was a net positive.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nGot you. And then last question, I'll let you guys move to the next. Harris Teeter, I'm a personal fan of. I shop there when I'm down south. And is there any other -- you guys have talked about some of the things they do well that you might be able to bring into The Kroger store base. Anything since we last did a conference call that you can update us on?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nRobbie, it's -- the merger ultimately closed January 28. So it's only been a handful of weeks since we've actually been able to roll up our sleeves and have the kind of conversations you want to have when you start integrating a company. That said, we've made a lot of progress in those 6 or so weeks since the merger's been closed. Clearly, one of the things we like is that about -- a little over 160 of their stores, they have what -- it's called Express Lane, we call it click and collect. That's something that intrigues us as -- it's an internet but pick-it-up yourself kind of a process at the store that appears to appeal very strongly to their customer. That's something we'll try to learn from. But it's been a very positive and we're very happy with the start we've had to the integration progress with Harris Teeter. And any surprise that we've seen has been a positive, not a negative surprise, which is always nice.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Hessler (Analysts)】\nSo my question is with the Harris Teeter acquisition, it kind of brought you back into the M&A market where you've been absent for a number of years. And I know you can't comment on market rumors, but internally, has there been any sort of shift or change in the way that you'd look at M&A opportunities?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nNo, I'd say it's consistent with how we've always done it. And also, as I said in my prepared comments, our investment-grade rating is important to us and we continue to expect to allocate free cash flow to maintain our rating.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Hessler (Analysts)】\nOkay. And I think with the Harris Teeter acquisition, you sort of temporarily went above that 2 to 2.2x net leverage target. I mean, how much flex do you feel like you have within the investment-grade rating band? And would you be able -- or would you be willing to even go maybe a little bit higher than that for the right strategic opportunity?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes -- I'm not going to comment on that. And obviously, the only reason -- the reason we're above the 2.2x on Harris Teeter is the shareholders won't wait a year to get their check for the purchase of their shares. They want that upfront. We don't get a year's worth of EBITDA until the end of the year. So it's really just the fact we have all the debt and none of the EBITDA now, and we feel very good about our ability to get back under 2.2x in the time frame we outlined to the rating agencies.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nA couple of questions just on your guidance. What is your -- in guidance, specifically. What is your guidance and planned D&A, as well as interest expense? It seems like -- I mean, we can kind of calculate interest expense or incremental interest expense related to Harris Teeter, but D&A was a little bit of a wildcard. So any color there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nObviously, from the write-off of the assets for Harris Teeter, the amortization of that will pick up. I don't have that in front of me, and I prefer not to go giving guidance on every line of the income statement. I might as well just hand you my business plan and let the whole world have it, which I think we give as much or more guidance than anyone. So you should be able to back into it just based on the public guidance we've given of what our earnings per share is and the number of lines we've given you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then looking at your MEPP guidance for 2014, I think it reflects kind of an 11% increase in the expense. Any color on why that increase is so high. That just seems high to me.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nThe contributions into the plan?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nYes, the $250 million?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nIt's just our expectation. There are some funds in rehab status that -- one of the ways you get out of rehab status is you put a little bit more money in, benefits come down a little bit and over time, it's an attempt to try to get them in a better funded position. It's -- while the percentage is fairly strong, it's not that much incremental cash that we're expecting next year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nAnd it would be something that we'll work with the unions on to make sure that we try to get those funds in a status that's sustainable over time. And it would be an ongoing negotiation and relationship in terms of the balance between what money we spend on pension, what money we spend on health care and what we're able to do on wages. So it's really all together.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's helpful. And just on your investment-grade ratings, getting back to that 2x to 2.2x, I guess what I'm confused about is why wouldn't they be looking at the pro forma number regardless in terms of your investment-grade rating [indiscernible] they are?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, I believe the rating agencies do that, which is why they did not downgrade us when we announced the merger. Obviously, the conversations were -- with them were our commitment to get it back down there based on a pro forma calculation you do for them, and that's what they got comfortable with. So from the rating agency standpoint, they would look at it that way. But from the number I have to report, my number is my number.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nCould you touch on a couple of categories in particular about how they did during the quarter, one would be general merchandise, especially at Fred Meyer and then prepared foods, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nYes, general merchandise, it was such an interesting holiday season with 6 less selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. And predicting our business and building our business plan around that was certainly -- it doesn't happen very often. But overall, the season came out pretty decent. It wasn't as different as we would've thought it would've been. I think we actually came out okay when you figure the changes in by Friday, the differences in the calendar and everything else that occurred. And so in general, I would say it came out okay. Jewelry, for example, for us, had a really stellar quarter, and general merchandise was fairly decent. I mean, I would say it came out okay. But in terms of -- what was the other question, prepared food?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes -- and overall, it turned out better than we were expecting when you think about 6 less days and the economy and especially some of the weather in parts of the countries. But overall, we felt pretty good about it, prepared goods. Go ahead, Mike.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nPrepared foods continue to be a growing section of our business for us, so we're committing more and more space and better products all the time to those types of departments and items. So I wouldn't say there's anything really unusual when it comes to prepared food.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nAll right. And finally, can you give us an update on sales trends, thus far, into the first quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nObviously, it's very early in the quarter. Right now, we would be a little bit better than the high side of the range, but it's still very early, and we believe the weather has been a positive so far. As we've mentioned, as Mike mentioned in the prepared remarks, when you look at the year as a whole, we expect inflation to be reasonably modest throughout the whole year. But so far, so good.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Grambling (Analysts)】\nYou did mention the innovation in digital on the YOU Tech acquisition. So can you actually maybe describe some of the synergies that come from that acquisition, what they are maybe bringing to the table that you didn't have already and just the contribution you're expecting there over the next, call it, 5 years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nWell, I'm not really so sure I can comment on synergies, but we do like what YOU Tech brings to us in terms of the technology and our ability to serve up coupons for our customers in a really meaningful way. And you couple that with dunnhumby, and we think that this really gives us a great platform to communicate better with our customer and provide them both technology and the coupons that they're looking for today. Because a customer can redeem coupons simply by taking their loyalty card into the store and scanning it, and they're receiving the things they want most and getting discounts on those items.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Grambling (Analysts)】\nWhen I said synergies, I guess, I meant qualitatively. And I guess, the follow-up would be, as you look at developing this yourself versus making this acquisition, is this just the way to jumpstart moving to maybe even integrating some of the customized coupons to the customer?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nYes, well, it certainly helped us move faster. And the relationship with YOU Technology has moved us along a lot quicker than we probably would've done on our own.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, there's multiple levels to it, Stephen. When you talk about customized coupons, today, all of the digital coupons that are out there, there's a sort feature on The Kroger app that allows you to sort those coupons based on the relevance to you of how you shop and what you buy. So rather than having to search through all the coupons that might be attractive, the app basically does that for you based on how you actually buy product.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Grambling (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then I have a quick follow-up to I think it was Ken's question. And you had mentioned last quarter that you would expect the margin on natural organic items to converge over time with conventional. And as I think initially, it may have been viewed as maybe reduction in margin on those items, but given the consolidation in the space and your reallocation of the natural organic to be a little bit greater versus the center store, is there any reason to see the margin maybe even go up on the conventional items over time?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nIt's a good question. I think it's pretty hard to say. We would not expect that as a general rule and we're really focused on figuring out ways to give the customer better and better deal.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Wiltamuth (Analysts)】\nSo Cerberus is one of the parties reportedly looking at Safeway. If you look at their behavior after their acquisition of the Supervalu banners, would you say they were more or less disciplined on price? And how is their behavior in the marketplace as a competitor after the move there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nObviously, in terms of a lot of specifics, we won't be able to give you that. But we look at Cerberus and Albertsons as a very good competitor, and we're really focused on what does our customer want and then how do we get better about delivering against that. They're a good competitor, but there's a lot of good competitors out there. So probably a little more focused on the basics every day, but I wouldn't say it's appreciable different.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Wiltamuth (Analysts)】\nOkay, so you didn't see any C-change in pricing strategy or anything like that as they shifted there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nNo, not to the extent that you would think. It was a completely different person before. They do a better job on the basics. They also will consolidate stores. They ended up selling off some stores, things like that, but it's -- every transaction is different.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Todd Duvick (Analysts)】\nJust looking at cash flow for 2014, can you tell us after the Harris Teeter acquisition, whether or not you expect working capital to be either a use or a source of cash? And can you give us kind of an order of magnitude?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, we continue to do a really good job on our working capital usage. If you look at the consolidated balance sheet, the way we look at it, and it's the balance sheet with Harris Teeter combined into it. We had just about $75 million or $80 million reduction in working capital overall for the year and we still have plans in place of things that we think could continue to improve that. We wouldn't budget in dramatic improvements and have that in expectation of as a source of cash, but we would expect to have some benefit from it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Todd Duvick (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's helpful. And then I think you also indicated that you expect to contribute about $250 million to the multiemployer pension plans this year, and I assume that includes Harris Teeter. Can you confirm that? And can you tell us if there are multiemployer pension -- I guess, obligations were materially larger than your overall obligations?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nHarris Teeter is not a party or not a member of any of the multiemployer funds. They're 100% employee choice. So I guess, that would be total company, the contributions, but none of it has reflected the result of the merger with Harris Teeter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nMike, my question for you is on CapEx. I don't think it was asked. But your guidance, Mike, looks like it calls for about, I don't know, maybe a $600 million increase in CapEx. I think Harris Teeter, based on what they've shown historically, could be a couple hundred of that. And you know what, obviously, your longer-term guidance was an additional $200 million a year. So could you just kind of help us understand where the increase in CapEx is coming from?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nSure. If you go back to our December call, we were projecting a point estimate of $2.4 billion for this year. We came in at $2.3 billion. Some of that is just a little delay on some projects that caused it to be a little behind where we expect it. We would expect that catch-up to happen in 2014. So if you think about 2014 going off of a $2.4 billion base, the $200 million increase that we would've expected on an annual basis would get you to $2.6 billion. And then adding in the activity for Harris Teeter, which will probably be a little higher than the number you used, may continue to have some attractive opportunities and their own forecast would have had their CapEx continuing to grow because they were growing their company. That's really how we got the build up to $2.8 billion to $3 billion.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then as we think about sort of beyond this maybe like '15, I -- we probably shouldn't throw $200 million on top of '14 number because of the catch-up, I guess, is how to think about it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nIt's a little early to give 2015 guidance, but for planning purposes at this point, I would be thinking about another $200 million internally.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nAnd Ed, the thing we're really focused on, and Mike mentioned it in his prepared comments, is the incremental capital we're spending, what returns are we getting for that and what's our ability to execute at that higher level because obviously it creates jobs and we have to find associates to staff those stores and run those stores. And as long as we're feeling good about being able to help develop our associates to run the stores and their performance continues to be strong, we would continue to expect to continue to increase capital.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nAnd as we said, we're coming close to picking a market to go into organically, which will take some capital as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nAnd just a follow-up on that, Mike and Rodney, when you think about a new market, what are the dynamics that you're really sort of looking for to make that decision in terms of where you ultimately go?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWell, we look at a wide range of topics, including the competitive landscape. We look at where the market may be situated compared to our existing infrastructure. It would be very nice if it winds up being a market that our current logistics and manufacturing systems can supply product to them, again, the dynamics of the market, not just the competitive landscape, but the growth that you see in a potential market. And then some customer research of what it is the customer wants from a grocery retailer and how we have been able to perform against that over time in the markets where we already operate. So it's a very long list of things. Those would be amongst the bigger.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThanks, Glenn. Before we end the call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. First, I'd like to welcome our Harris Teeter associates to The Kroger family. We couldn't be happier. I'd also like to thank our associates for your hard work in connection with our customers. We finished 2013 strong because of your hard work to provide friendly service and fresh products to every customer every time, every day. You also helped keep costs under control so we can reinvest the savings in things that matter most to our customers. They are taking note of your efforts and giving us credit for making a difference. Special thanks to each and every one of you for all you do for our customers and each other.\r\nThis week, we will host our third annual associate recognition event in Cincinnati. Our 33 associate honorees come from across the company, including our retail divisions, fee stores, manufacturing and logistics facilities, Fred Meyer Jewelry, the Little Clinic and general office. They will be recognized during this 2-day event for their friendly service, strong leadership, dedication to their community and courage in the fight against cancer. \r\nFinally, I'd like to say thank you to our Chairman, Dave Dillon, for his leadership and the powerful foundation he and our team have put in place. I am humbled to be serving as your CEO and excited to work with our outstanding leadership team. We're not done serving our customers, growing our business and performing for shareholders. Indeed, we're just getting started. That completes our call for today. Thanks for joining us, and thank you for all you do to partner with Kroger.",

      "transcript_text1": "Good morning. This is Joyce Brooks, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today's call for a discussion of McCormick's first quarter financial results and 2014 outlook. We've posted a set of slides to accompany our call at ir.mccormick.com. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded. \r\nWith me this morning are Alan Wilson, Chairman, President and CEO, who will begin with comments on the latest financial performance and business update; and Gordon Stetz, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will provide a more detailed review of first quarter results and the latest financial guidance for 2014. As a reminder, today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors. As seen on Slide 2, our forward-looking statement also provides information on risk factors that could affect our financial results. \r\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Alan.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Joyce. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our first quarter results included solid sales growth and a strong cash flow, as well as earnings per share that was ahead of our initial outlook. These results were driven by progress with our growth strategy and the dedicated efforts of McCormick employees around the world. \r\nWe grew sales 8% in local currency. The incremental impact of WAPC, acquired mid-2013, accounted for about half this increase. Product innovation, distribution expansion, brand marketing support and pricing also drove sales growth in each of our 2 segments. Gross profit margin rose 70 basis points due in part to a favorable business mix and our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI, which is generating cost savings throughout the company. Increased sales, higher gross margins and our diligent expense management led to an 11% increase in operating income, which included additional brand marketing support. The operating income result was ahead of our expectation for the first quarter and drove a 9% increase in earnings per share even with a higher tax rate. Clearly, we're off to a good start in 2014, and have greater confidence in our ability to achieve our financial objectives for the year. \r\nAs Gordon will discuss in more detail, we are reaffirming our 2014 outlook for sales growth and earnings per share. As we look to the rest of 2014 and beyond, we're encouraged by the increasing consumer demand for flavor. Spices, herbs and seasonings are on trend and a healthy way to add taste and not for a lot of cost. Our meals are typically just a fraction of the cost of a meal to deliver most of the flavor. The outlook by Euromonitor shows growth in spices and herbs and in recipe mixes in both developed and emerging markets. For herbs, spice and seasonings, the largest part of our consumer business, you can see our category share information on Slide 5 along with attractive category growth rates in our top markets. \r\nIn developed markets, the majority of millennials say they love to cook and the percentage of all consumers that are hot for spicy sauces, dips and condiments is up 8 points from the last 2 years. The exploration of new flavors is evidenced by the popularity of ethnic fare. In emerging markets, an increase in the middle class and in working women are driving a transition from spices in bulk to spices as a branded packaged food product that offers greater quality, safety and convenience. Demand for flavor is on the rise, whether consumers are preparing meals at home, eating out or enjoying a snack. As a flavor leader, it is our job to accelerate this growth and build our share. \r\nWe position our consumer business to flavor meals at home. Our growth strategies include brand building, scalable innovation and expanding our geographic footprint. In the first quarter of 2014, each of these avenues of growth contributed to an overall 9% increase in consumer business sales in local currency. The addition of WAPC accounted for 7 percentage points of this increase. I'm pleased to report that this acquisition continues to outpace our forecast for sales and profit growth. At the operating income line, we achieved an 8% increase in the first quarter for our consumer business, including the impact of a double-digit increase in brand marketing support. \r\nStaying in China, in addition to the benefit of WAPC, we grew consumer sales of our base business 20% this period, with increases in both herbs and spices and in condiments. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, we grew sales 4% in local currency, led by strong increases in France and in several smaller markets. Across this region, we increased brand marketing support by 38% in the quarter, with a holiday TV advertising in France, a brand quality message in Poland and support for our Flavour Shots launch in the U.K. \r\nIn the Americas, sales in local currency were about even with the year-ago period. The competitive pressure in the U.S., as we noted in the fourth quarter of 2013, is being addressed with actions to strengthen our brand equity with the consumer and to win at retail. The first is to increase our investment in marketing. In the first quarter, nearly half of the incremental brand marketing was directed towards the U.S. market to drive sales of core products. These additional funds were applied to an everyday cooking message with an emphasis on healthy eating and a closer to fresh message with an emphasis on our Gourmet line. \r\nDuring this period, we also continued to develop our digital marketing programs, connected to the consumer in a personalized way. As for insight-based innovation, I'll comment in a minute on the new items at retail across our markets. In the U.S. specifically, we've developed, and underway, for new product concepts for launch in the second half of 2014. These products align with our consumer insights, addressing demand for convenience, flavor and quality. We're excited about their sales potential and you'll know more about these in our next earnings call in June. \r\nTo win at retail, we've realigned our sales organization to boost our resources in underdeveloped markets, where category share of our brands is below the national average. Using insights and analytics, we're setting a gold standard for addressing the retail spice test [ph], one that better addresses how consumers shop our categories. This is fostering a more strategic dialogue with our customers as we work with them on category management with a goal to optimize sales and income in this highly profitable section of their store. \r\nOur consumer business group in the U.S. is energized by the actions underway to drive better results and I share their enthusiasm. We are encouraged by early signs of traction based on consumption of core spices and seasonings and in recipe mixes. \r\nAs I wrap up my remarks in our consumer business, I want to comment on innovation across our 3 regions. We have some great new products now in the market. These were developed based on our consumer segmentation research and more in-depth insights and include items designed to appeal to value-minded consumers, as well as involved cooks seeking more premium products. On the items shown on Slide 9, I'm particularly excited about the potential for Flavour Shots in the U.K., our 13 spice blend in China and in the U.S., Grill Mates burger mixes for the 2014 grilling season and gluten-free recipe mixes. \r\nInnovation is also a key driver for our industrial business. We supply flavors to the top food service restaurant chains and the top food and beverage companies. These industry leaders look to McCormick as a partner to develop flavors in their next market-leading products. \r\nIn the first quarter, we're very pleased with our industrial business results. In the Americas region, we've won the supply of new products to food and beverage companies and grown sales of branded food service products. These gains more than offset continued weak demand from quick service restaurants. 2013 was an excellent year for our industrial business in EMEA and the success continues in 2014, with a 12% local currency sales growth in the first quarter. We're driving sales through expanded distribution of new products, particularly in this market with quick service restaurants. The improvement in industrial sales in China continued this quarter with a 20% increase in local currency. This growth rate compares to weak demand in quick service restaurants in the first quarter of 2013 that related to concerns about avian flu and poultry menu items. \r\nIn total, for our industrial business, we grew first quarter 2014 sales 6% in local currency, largely through higher volume and product mix, with minimal pricing impact. This growth rate, together with a more favorable business mix, our CCI cost savings and in comparison to a weaker result in the first quarter of 2013, led to a 24% increase in operating income and an operating income margin of 8%. We expect further improvement in the upcoming quarters. \r\nTo summarize, for the majority of markets across our 2 segments, we achieved good first quarter financial results and have momentum. In the U.S. consumer business, we have actions under way to improve our market performance and we expect to see a positive financial impact as we progress through the next few quarters. \r\nIn a dynamic market, we believe there are several factors that create an advantage for our business. Our leading positions in growing markets, our breadth of products from value-priced to premium, flavors for all types of eating occasions, market-leading customers and an expanding geographic presence. Across the company, we're bringing focus, setting priorities and directing our resources based on McCormick's strategic imperatives, ready talent, fully engaged, winning share with a global focus and performance. Superior results consistently delivered. \r\nTogether, we believe these imperatives will drive our success and lead to greater value for McCormick shareholders. Gordon?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. As Alan has described, we had solid first quarter financial results that included strong sales growth in many parts of the business, greater-than-expected earnings per share driven by our growth strategies, CCI program and share repurchase activity and excellent cash flow. \r\nI'll begin with a closer look at sales and operating income for each segment. Let's start with the consumer business. As seen on Slide 14, we grew consumer business sales 9% in local currency. This builds on a 7% sales increase in the first quarter of 2013 that was largely volume and product mix-driven and had no impact from acquisitions. \r\nIn the first quarter of 2014, sales from WAPC accounted for 7 percentage points of the increase and higher pricing contributed 2 percentage points. In the Americas region, sales were about even with the year-ago period in local currency. A 2% increase in pricing, following a late-2013 pricing action, was offset by lower volume and product mix. In comparison, consumer sales in this region rose 7% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2013 from the first quarter of 2012, and the increase is mainly attributable to higher volumes and product mix. \r\nAs Alan described, our U.S. consumer business has actions under way to drive performance and we have early indications of improvement. We are also pleased to see that category growth remains healthy for spices and seasonings and recipe mixes based on the latest retail sales. \r\nIn Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, we grew consumer sales 4% in local currency. The increase was largely volume and product-mix driven, evidence of the growth strategies under way for brand building and scalable innovation. We increased brand marketing support 38%, and introduced a number of new items. The sales increase this period was particularly strong in France and in several smaller markets. \r\nIn local currency, consumer business sales in the Asia/Pacific region rose 73%. The addition of WAPC, which will also have an incremental benefit in the second quarter of 2014, accounted for 64 percentage points of the growth. We grew sales at the base business 9%, building upon a 15% year-over-year increase in sales in the first quarter of 2013. China led this base business growth with a 20% sales increase, mainly from new products and expanded distribution. \r\nFor the Kohinoor brand in India, sales rose slightly in local currency, with significantly higher pricing offset by lower volume and product mix in the first quarter. Operating income for the consumer business rose 8% to $94 million from the first quarter of 2013. This increase was primarily due to higher sales, a favorable business mix and CCI cost savings, which more than offset a $6 million increase in brand marketing support. \r\nTurning to our industrial business, we grew first quarter sales by 6% in local currency, led by favorable volume and product mix, as seen on Slide 19. As Alan noted, we had increases in each of our 3 regions. In the Americas, industrial sales rose 3% in local currency, with strong demand from food manufacturers in the U.S. and in Mexico. We have won the supply of a number of seasoning and flavor products for snack chips, crackers, breakfast food and yogurt. We also grew sales of branded food service products. \r\nDemand from quick service restaurants remained weak in this market through the first quarter. We continue to work with our customers to draw restaurant traffic by developing flavors for new menu items. \r\nIn EMEA, our industrial business achieved another quarter of strong sales growth with a 12% increase in local currency. This followed the strong sales increase in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. The first quarter increase in 2014 reflects continued success with product innovation and distribution gains, largely with quick service restaurants and the impact of higher pricing in response to material cost increases. \r\nIn the first quarter of 2014, we grew industrial business sales in the Asia/Pacific region by 10% in local currency. Volume and product mix is improving in China, as this market recovers from the sharp year-ago decline, as Alan described. Based on our current outlook, we expect this improvement to continue to the next few quarters. \r\nOperating income for the industrial business rose 24% to $30 million. Across all 3 regions, higher sales, together with CCI cost savings and a favorable business mix drove this performance. These first quarter 2014 results for our industrial business, with sales up 4% and profit up 24%, are a reversal of declines in the first quarter of 2013, which included the year-over-year operating income decrease of 22%. \r\nAcross most parts of this business, we are pleased with our progress and its strong financial results driven by our growth strategies. \r\nFor the total company, operating income rose 11% as a result of higher sales, a more favorable business mix and our CCI cost savings. These same factors also improved gross profit margin by 70 basis points. And during the quarter, we funded additional brand marketing programs with more investment planned in the upcoming quarters. \r\nAs projected, the tax rate this period rose to 31.1% from 28.5% in the year-ago period. This increase was due to the discontinuation of the R&D tax credit, a tax law change in France and the mix of income across tax jurisdictions. For the fiscal year, we continue to expect the tax rate to exceed 2013 and for 2014 to be in a 30% to 31% range. Income from unconsolidated operations was down slightly from last year. Cost to relocate our joint venture in Mexico to a more efficient and higher capacity facility began to impact our results towards the end of 2013, continued into the first quarter of 2014, and are expected to extend into the second quarter. Once we get past this in the back half of the year, we expect a strong year-over-year increase in the income from unconsolidated operations. \r\nWe reported earnings per share of $0.62.  This was a 9% increase from $0.57 in the year-ago period and driven by higher operating income and lower shares outstanding, which were offset in part by the unfavorable tax rate. \r\nLet's turn next to some highlights for cash flow and quarter-end balance sheet, as summarized on Slide 28. Cash flow from operations was $77 million, up significantly from $32 million in the first quarter of 2013. This improvement was led by lower pension contributions in 2014. During this period, we used $57 million of cash to repurchase 0.9 million shares. At quarter end, we had $303 million still available on our $400 million authorization. \r\nOur balance sheet remains sound. We are close to our target debt level and well-positioned to fund investments to drive growth, including future acquisitions. \r\nTurning to our 2014 outlook, we continue to expect momentum from increased consumer demand for flavor and the effectiveness of our growth strategies, and are reaffirming our projected sales and profit growth for 2014. At the top line, we reaffirm a 3% to 5% projected increase in sales on a currency-neutral basis, with higher volumes, the effect of increase pricing and in the first half of the year, the incremental impact of WAPC. \r\nIn addition, we expect currency to reduce sales by approximately 1 percentage point in 2014 based on prevailing exchange rates. We continue to project a 6% to 8% increase in operating income from $591 million of adjusted operating income in 2013. This projection includes the benefit of CCI cost savings that are expected to reach at least $45 million for 2014. Our earnings per share outlook remain $3.22 to $3.29. This is a year-over-year increase of 3% to 5% from adjusted 2013 EPS of $3.13. As we discussed in January, we expect the impact of higher operating income to be offset in part by an increased tax rate. \r\nAs shown on Slide 30, our projection for a higher tax rate and a $0.01 in special charges are expected to have an unfavorable impact of 5% to 6% on the 2014 EPS growth rate. In the second quarter of 2014, we are projecting only a slight increase in earnings per share from $0.59 that we reported in the second quarter of 2013. This outlook is based on our plans for higher brand marketing support and continued weakness in demand from quick service restaurants in the U.S., as well as additional costs related to the facility relocation in our Mexican joint venture. With our first quarter results, we're on our way toward another year of strong cash flow. As many of you know, we adhere to a balanced use of cash and are committed to returning a significant portion to our shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases. \r\nIn 2014, we expect to use nearly $200 million of cash for dividend and through share repurchases to reduce our shares outstanding by 1% to 2% this year. As I conclude my comments, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our 2014 financial objectives and look forward to reporting on our progress in the upcoming quarters. So now let's turn to your questions, after which Alan will provide some closing remarks. Operator, we are ready for the first question.",

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our first quarter results included solid sales growth and a strong cash flow, as well as earnings per share that was ahead of our initial outlook. These results were driven by progress with our growth strategy and the dedicated efforts of McCormick employees around the world. \r\nWe grew sales 8% in local currency. The incremental impact of WAPC, acquired mid-2013, accounted for about half this increase.

Volume and product mix is improving in China, as this market recovers from the sharp year-ago decline, as Alan described. Based on our current outlook, we expect this improvement to continue to the next few quarters. \r\nOperating income for the industrial business rose 24% to $30 million. Across all 3 regions, higher sales, together with CCI cost savings and a favorable business mix drove this performance. These first quarter 2014 results for our industrial business, with sales up 4% and profit up 24%, are a reversal of declines in the first quarter of 2013, which included the year-over-year operating income decrease of 22%. \r\nAcross most parts of this business, we are pleased with our progress and its strong financial results driven by our growth strategies. \r\nFor the total company, operating income rose 11% as a result of higher sales, a more favorable business mix and our CCI cost savings.

At the top line, we reaffirm a 3% to 5% projected increase in sales on a currency-neutral basis, with higher volumes, the effect of increase pricing and in the first half of the year, the incremental impact of WAPC. \r\nIn addition, we expect currency to reduce sales by approximately 1 percentage point in 2014 based on prevailing exchange rates. We continue to project a 6% to 8% increase in operating income from $591 million of adjusted operating income in 2013. This projection includes the benefit of CCI cost savings that are expected to reach at least $45 million for 2014. Our earnings per share outlook remain $3.22 to $3.29. This is a year-over-year increase of 3% to 5% from adjusted 2013 EPS of $3.13. As we discussed in January, we expect the impact of higher operating income to be offset in part by an increased tax rate. \r\nAs shown on Slide 30, our projection for a higher tax rate and a $0.01 in special charges are expected to have an unfavorable impact of 5% to 6% on the 2014 EPS growth rate. In the second quarter of 2014, we are projecting only a slight increase in earnings per share from $0.59 that we reported in the second quarter of 2013. This outlook is based on our plans for higher brand marketing support and continued weakness in demand from quick service restaurants in the U.S., as well as additional costs related to the facility relocation in our Mexican joint venture. With our first quarter results, we're on our way toward another year of strong cash flow. As many of you know, we adhere to a balanced use of cash and are committed to returning a significant portion to our shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases. \r\nIn 2014, we expect to use nearly $200 million of cash for dividend and through share repurchases to reduce our shares outstanding by 1% to 2% this year. As I conclude my comments, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our 2014 financial objectives and look forward to reporting on our progress in the upcoming quarters. So now let's turn to your questions, after which Alan will provide some closing remarks. Operator, we are ready for the first question.",
      "transcript_text3": "Gordon or Alan, could you provide us just a little bit more insight where -- how this quarter was so much better than what you initially expected? Where was the upside surprise?\n\n---\n\nI'd say it's in a few areas, Thilo. It would be stronger growth in pretty much all of our businesses outside the U.S. And within the gross margin, it was a stronger gross margin based on the mix that we experienced within the quarter. So I'd say those 2 factors are the primary ones that outdelivered relative to our initial expectations.\n\n---\n\nIs the stronger growth outside of the U.S. driven by a one-time factor? Because based on what I'm hearing about the world outside the U.S., it's not looking necessarily that much better from a macro perspective.\n\n---\n\nWell, there was nothing one-time in nature within the quarter. I mean, it was all driven by the brand marketing support, innovation; and on the industrial side, the strength of our customer relationships. So I can't say that there was an anomaly within it. Certainly, we see the world that we operate in and understand it's a difficult environment, and that continues to give us caution as well.\n\n---\n\nYes, I would say 1 thing where we're a little counterintuitive [ph] to some of the rest of what we're reading is our business in China is continuing to show strong growth. And we are just -- we're gaining distribution of our core business, and then the acquisition of WAPC has outperformed what we expected it to.\n\n---\n\nOkay. That's good. And then last question I have for you. On Kohinoor, you called out high price increases due to higher input cost again and the impact on volumes. What we are hearing from other basmati rice companies in India, they seem to be faring much better with these price increases and might have different input cost profile than you do. Can you provide a little bit more background there, what the level of input cost increases is and why the impact on volumes is so meaningful?\n\n---\n\nYes, we're seeing about a 20-plus percent increase in the cost of rice and are passing that through and are dealing with that through volume. We may have a bit of a different supply chain model than some of our competitors there because we're more -- remember, our strategy in India is to use the access to the supply chain and the customer base to expand into different areas. So while basmati rice is the business today, that's not our long-term intention. So we have a little bit different objective and a different profile than some of our competitors there.\n\n---\n\nThis is Rachel Nabatian in for Rob. So my question is on the Europe business, which is strong, and it sounds like there is a lot of support put behind it. From what we've seen, that region can be rather volatile and recently, we've only heard negative commentary on grocery there. So what we'd like to know is what gives you the confidence that what you're seeing here is sustainable growth?\n\n---\n\nWell, I'd never say it's not ever not going to be a bit volatile, but what we're doing is driving our new product innovation, supporting it with pretty strong advertising, both in our core spice and seasoning business and the recipe mix business that we have in France, and we are seeing the response from that. That doesn't say Europe is not a tough place to operate and is not highly competitive, but we are gaining traction from the programs that we have.\n\n---\n\nUnderstood. Okay. And then just as a follow-up, on the value side of the plan to turn around the U.S. consumer business, according to our scanner data, it looks like private label continues to take share. And you had mentioned kind of innovation ranging from the value to the premium side, so I guess I wanted to know how you plan to combat the private label competition specifically?\n\n---\n\nWell, we offer a broad range of products across all the price points. And to remind you, we do produce private label, so that's a part of what's in our portfolio as well. With -- what we're doing is, one, making sure we've got the right promoted price at the right times of the year when consumers are buying. The second thing is a building the equity and -- behind our brand and then driving product innovation in the category. I think the spice and seasonings business, it's still going to take some time. We're encouraged by what we're seeing in our core business early -- our core products early on and that's what we're supporting with advertising. We're also driving the category and gaining share in our recipe mix business. So we've got early signs of traction. We're not calling the turnaround yet, but we are encouraged by what we're seeing.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to ask about the industrial operating margins. When I look over a multi-quarter period of time really in 2013, every quarter seemed to get sequentially better. Although, clearly, on a year-over-year basis, a number of those quarters in fiscal '13 were down from fiscal '12. The simple question here is, you had nice improvement year-on-year in the first quarter in industrial margins.  Do you expect that to continue? And is the pattern of improvement throughout -- the sequential improvement throughout '13, is that indicative as to what's happening within the business?\n\n---\n\nDavid, it's a fair observation. And certainly, we are building upon the improvement that we saw in the fourth quarter, which was very strong margin for that business and we're pleased with the performance we saw in Q1. We certainly look for better performance on the industrial business. The absolute margin is a function of promotional activity and mix of the business within the quarter, so I'm a little cautious about saying that each quarter will get sequentially better. But I'd say, overall, we certainly are looking for an industrial margin improvement and so it's a function of, again, the recovery that we're seeing in some of those markets like China, a slightly more benign inflationary environment and good CCI performance. But I'm encouraged by the performance, but we're still a bit cautious on just predicting it quarter-by-quarter.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Final question for me. Can you just say what are the factors that are causing that fiscal second quarter to be flattish year-on-year? It seems like when we just look at the first quarter results, a lot of the things that happened in the first quarter repeat in the second quarter, yet you are expecting worse results versus the growth that we saw in Q1. So what's happening in Q2?\n\n---\n\nWell, we're going to lean into our business again. So the brand marketing support that you saw in Q1, we're repeating that again in Q2 and perhaps even a little more. As we mentioned, the unconsolidated income line will continue to be impacted by some of these relocation costs that we saw in Q1 from our unconsolidated venture in Mexico. You heard us talk about some of our caution on the QSR side of things in the U.S., and we're still encouraged by the early signs of the U.S. consumer business, but we are up against some strong comparisons to the second quarter of last year, where we grew volume quite strongly. So that's part of our caution as well.\n\n---\n\nI hear you on all those comments.  I would only say that, from the outside, it looks like those are consistent with the same forces that impacted Q1. So it's not immediately obvious why Q2 would be flat, but I'll leave it there.\n\n---\n\nMaybe in -- just to touch on the global industrial for a second and the strength there. I think Thilo may have tried to ask this question in another way. But with the Heinz, 3G, Burger King connection, they made some strides with McDonald’s, did you pick up some McDonald's business? And has that been a help to that side of the company?\n\n---\n\nAs you know, that is a significant customer for us and we supply them around the world. So there has been some realignment in the supply chain there and we've been growing our business with that customer in Europe and in China. [indiscernible] It's really tougher to say.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then second question on the U.S. consumer business. Alan, I asked you last quarter, was the weakness that you had reported in the fourth quarter really just a function of core spice and seasonings or was it broader-based into things like Zatarain's and some of the grilling items, et cetera. Can you go into a little bit more detail? It sounds like this core spice and seasonings business was still pretty weak. But is that true with some of the other products as well or did you make improvement there?\n\n---\n\nWe're seeing improvement actually in our core spices and our recipe mixes. We're still seeing some weakness in some of those other brands, and some of it's driven by from our promotional plan from last year.  We were pretty heavy early in the year. Those are going to be more spread this year. Secondly, a little bit of a later Mardi Gras, and I never want to use weather as an excuse but we're seeing in Zatarain's, for instance, the cost of crawfish pretty high right now. We'd expect this to be coming into pretty heavy crawfish season and the weather has made that a little later. But fundamentally, what we're doing is driving behind our core business, which is our most profitable business and then over time, we're addressing the other businesses.\n\n---\n\nYes, I'm going to have to keep better track of my crawfish pricing index.\n\n---\n\nRight now, it's about $5. And in the middle of the season, it should be about $3.50. You're wondering why I know that.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just a quick follow-up and I'll pass it on. The -- I think you mentioned that you had put more money behind the Gourmet line. Is that -- and that's -- I guess that's your highest price point amongst -- in the core spices business. Did I hear that correctly, and is that kind of the response to the -- some of the other spice products being available in other aisles of the store and that's kind of, at least initially, how you intend to combat the new competitors in various outlets?\n\n---\n\nWell, we segment the consumer in a couple of different ways. One is by price points, the other is by how involved they are in cooking. And Gourmet is the involved cook who wants the best product. And so we are supporting and differentiating our product based on our freshness and unique sourcing on those products. So there is -- that is 1 part and 1 segment that we are going after. The other part of that is the more core and value-priced consumer. We have some other programs to try to address that. And then later in the year, we have some -- a relaunch of our Gourmet products that we're expecting to roll out.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to ask about the comment you made on the consumer -- U.S. consumer segment. You said you were seeing early signs of some improvement, I believe that's what you said. Can you give us some color on that? I mean, what is it exactly that you're seeing that makes you feel that way?\n\n---\n\nWe're seeing our share gap closing with our core spices. We're seeing growth and actually share gains in our recipe mixes. And we are seeing a flattening of share from some of those fragmented competitors that we talked about. Private label continues to gain, but the regional and smaller competitors are flattening out of it.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And in terms of your decision to continue to spend heavily behind that? I mean, can you give us some sense, I mean, you already had a pretty dominant share of voice in that segment or category.  Can you talk about returns you're seeing on the incremental dollars you're spending? Are they still pretty high returns and better than the industry average for every incremental $1 that you're spending on advertising?\n\n---\n\nYes, we're still continuing to see pretty strong ROIs based on the spending that we have. And in fact, advertising and our digital programs have much higher ROIs than the promotional spend that we were doing. We got a little heavy, I think, over the last year, in promotional spend and not all of those were great paybacks and didn't build equity. So we're -- we've adjusted our spending -- away from promotions. But we've adjusted our spending to more focus on equity-building.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just one last one on the Kohinoor acquisition. If you just take a step back, can you summarize sort of how that acquisition has performed since you bought it? There's been some puts and takes. And then just give us a sense of where you are really.  Are you in the first or second inning of your strategy to introduce new products through that distribution chain? So perhaps what may have gone -- what may have happened that's worse than your expectations so far? And then sort of where are we now relative to your broader longer-term plan in India?\n\n---\n\nWe're -- I think we're in the early stages of our plan in India. The things that we have done over the last year, we didn't acquire the full supply chain for that business in India because what we wanted was the retail presence and the ability to drive other products through that chain. What we've done over the last year has been to beef up our own supply chain to improve our service levels and to get better control of our inventory. We're focused on continuing to build our capabilities there and to start to introduce those new products. We have those products in place now and we're starting to roll those out. We've got a distribution chain in place. We expect to continue to see it grow but again, to remind you of our strategy in emerging markets, we have a tendency to pay-as-we-go. So we're not going to get out over the tips of our skiis and invest and lose a lot of money in a market until we're sure we have the infrastructure to support it. And then we'll pay it and expand as we go. That's exactly what we did in China. That's what we're doing in India. I would say, you asked how it's performing.  It's performing below our expectations at this point but we feel like we've got the right plans to address it.\n\n---\n\nI just had 2 questions for you. The first one, if I could ask, is a bit of a follow-on to Dave Driscoll's question about 2Q, but how -- I guess, I also had been planning on a bit of an Easter shift into Q2 as well. Is that occurring -- you talked about how much of a benefit it is -- sorry, excuse me if I missed that, but I want to get a better sense of how much that could help 2Q?\n\n---\n\nYes, that's a difficult one to predict, Chris, quite honestly. And we haven't talked about that and certainly our internal forecast, which is guiding us towards the direction we're giving you now has accounted for that. But I couldn't quantify that for sure for you right now.\n\n---\n\nYes, there's some shift in timing and it could have an impact, but our current outlook is exactly what Gordon says.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then did you cite how much emerging market growth you had this quarter? What sort of dollars sales growth did you see in those markets? Was that a significant contributor to the second quarter -- to the first quarter?\n\n---\n\nWell, certainly, the Wuhan acquisition is emerging markets. So we broke that out for you separately and we talked about China being up 20% and also, on the consumer side and double-digit on the industrial side. So we're talking double-digit type increases on the emerging markets side. So it was a big help and that was one of the outperformers on the quarter relative to our expectations.\n\n---\n\nBut it drove a lot of consumer growth rate.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. If I could maybe just squeeze 1 more in relation to the marketing. Did more of the marketing this quarter go towards Europe? And it looks like you got a pretty significant increase there and you think you'll spread it more towards the U.S. in the second quarter? Just curious how the phasing will go in between divisions.\n\n---\n\nNo, Europe was up about 38%, but 1/2 the marketing increase spend was in the U.S.\n\n---\n\nA couple of questions. First, as you look into the summer and you see much higher meat costs approaching, just curious how that affects your marketing plan in any way for grilling? And second, it looks like Cerberus will be on track to buy Safeway here. If that deal goes through, do you expect it will affect your distribution in any way? I'm just curious if you're stronger with either of those customers?\n\n---\n\nIn terms of meat costs, because of our grilling portfolio has a wide range of products that are good for a wide range of meat, even if the consumer starts trading from fillets to cheaper custom meat or even the burgers, a lot of our innovation actually are the burger mixes. So what we're hoping -- what we think will impact us more is the return to a more normal weather. We're really hoping for some better weather as we kind of head into the Memorial Day weekend. But our products will span across the broad range of whether it's pork or chicken or hamburger. Obviously, our Montreal Steak is great on steaks and we hope the consumers will continue to buy. But we think we're well-positioned no matter what's happening across the broad portfolio. In terms of the Safeway, Albertsons acquisition merger, we have a good position with both those customers. And so we're not anticipating this to have a significant impact on our business. We do have a strong relationship with both of them. As long as they're driving to win in the marketplace, we believe that's good for us.\n\n---\n\nTwo questions from me. The first one, obviously, you talked about seeing some of the early signs, and I guess I was under the impression, and it's probably still the case, that this kind of turnaround in the U.S. consumer is still going to take some time. But I guess things are reacting maybe positively a little more quickly than maybe I had thought. Is it fair to say that the brand equity building part is what's currently driving some of those early signs? And the winning at retail piece is going to take more time or is that not the right way to look at it?\n\n---\n\nI think that's kind of the right way to look at it. It is -- and I don't want to get over optimistic because we know it's going to take some time, but we are doing exactly what we said we're going to do. We're outselling our message with retailers.  That is a customer-by-customer and, in some cases, region-by-region approach that's going to take some time. And frankly, it's never done because when we present something that works for us, the competitor's in there presenting something else as well. But so that's going to be a longer side of it. But we immediately changed our focus into building consumer equity and we're starting to see some of the benefits of that.\n\n---\n\nIn terms of the winning at retail piece, even though it's very early, are there any maybe anecdotal thoughts you can share with maybe how some of those conversations have gone? I mean, are you seeing traction where you've had some conversations in sort of communicating with retailers where this just kind of makes sense and where some of their actions maybe don't make as much sense for them?\n\n---\n\nYes, we are seeing, certainly, varying degrees of acceptance and action in the store from that. But what we're really showing them is the best way to grow their sales and profits in this category and benefiting from the fact that the best way to grow their sales and profits is the same thing that works for us, which is to sell more higher-turning McCormick SKUs as opposed to lower-turning, cheaper alternative products.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then last quarter on the call, we talked a little bit about how you were looking at potentially some different options in order to address the consumer trends, both at the sort of the value line and the premium line, and potentially could include thinking about, let's say, a different line for sort of a value line, let's say. Maybe it's under the McCormick name, maybe it's under sort of a different name or somehow related. But I didn't know if there are any conclusions you came to with respect to how to address that and if there were going to be some other new items there maybe along those lines that we just haven't seen yet?\n\n---\n\nYes, we are working on some premium solutions, as well as some more value solutions. We already have a number of offerings in the value range. And our strategy with those is to meet a customer need, but not necessarily -- because those don't necessary drive traffic and they don't necessarily drive profitability for the retail or for us, but they're there to meet a customer need. We have a number of those offerings and we're continuing to evaluate what the right value offerings are. But premium, we've got some very concrete plans.\n\n---\n\nJust 2 quick questions. Maybe one last on China here and we can put it to rest. But the quarter was quite strong. Do you feel like you're starting to get more of a mass there now in terms of maybe distribution wins, getting a little bit easier than 12 months earlier? And then just maybe building on that, are there more M&A opportunities that can further accelerate things there?\n\n---\n\nYes, we certainly feel good that we're building scale in our consumer business in China. Our core business has continued to grow pretty strongly and then Wuhan, WAPC is an accelerator to that because it gives us access to a much bigger sales force in a different part of the country than where we've been. So that's why we made the acquisition. We do see -- we see other opportunities for acquisition, not just in that market but in a number of the markets that we targeted. So we have a pretty good outlook and a pretty good pipeline for those kinds of acquisitions.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I mean, is the pipeline pretty similar to what you've seen in the last 12 or 18 months or kind of getting better or worse?\n\n---\n\nI would say the pipeline itself is pretty similar and whether it comes to closure is another question, but the pipeline is pretty similar is what we've seen.\n\n---\n\nSure. That's helpful. And then just 1 quick question, if I could. On the input cost front, any update on what you're seeing?  I saw the low single-digit guide in the slide deck, but I know your bucket's a little bit different than some of the other CPG group and can be a little bit more volatile at times. So any additional color on things to maybe watch out for this year that you're seeing right now?\n\n---\n\nThe things that we see that are starting to move up are, as you probably have seen in corn and wheat, and soybeans and dairy are starting to move up a bit. So those impact us more on the industrial side of our business. I wouldn't say that we have any significant changes on the consumer side.\n\n---\n\nI'd like to thank you for your questions and for participating today. McCormick's 2014 fiscal year is off to a good start. Our strategic imperatives around people, growth and performance are driving sales, delivering CCI cost savings, which is our fuel for growth, and generating higher profits and strong cash flow. At McCormick, we bring the joy of flavor to every day. Our 125 year heritage of innovation, collaboration and commitment to this business is at the foundation of our global leadership in flavor and has us well-positioned for the future. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Alan. I'd also like to thank those on this morning's call. Through April 1, a replay of the call can be accessed by dialing (855) 859-2056. The ID number is 22127582.

But I'm encouraged by the performance, but we're still a bit cautious on just predicting it quarter-by-quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Driscoll (Analysts)】\nOkay. Final question for me. Can you just say what are the factors that are causing that fiscal second quarter to be flattish year-on-year? It seems like when we just look at the first quarter results, a lot of the things that happened in the first quarter repeat in the second quarter, yet you are expecting worse results versus the growth that we saw in Q1. So what's happening in Q2?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gordon Stetz (Executives)】\nWell, we're going to lean into our business again. So the brand marketing support that you saw in Q1, we're repeating that again in Q2 and perhaps even a little more. As we mentioned, the unconsolidated income line will continue to be impacted by some of these relocation costs that we saw in Q1 from our unconsolidated venture in Mexico. You heard us talk about some of our caution on the QSR side of things in the U.S., and we're still encouraged by the early signs of the U.S. consumer business, but we are up against some strong comparisons to the second quarter of last year, where we grew volume quite strongly. So that's part of our caution as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Driscoll (Analysts)】\nI hear you on all those comments.  I would only say that, from the outside, it looks like those are consistent with the same forces that impacted Q1. So it's not immediately obvious why Q2 would be flat, but I'll leave it there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Katzman (Analysts)】\nMaybe in -- just to touch on the global industrial for a second and the strength there. I think Thilo may have tried to ask this question in another way. But with the Heinz, 3G, Burger King connection, they made some strides with McDonald’s, did you pick up some McDonald's business? And has that been a help to that side of the company?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nAs you know, that is a significant customer for us and we supply them around the world. So there has been some realignment in the supply chain there and we've been growing our business with that customer in Europe and in China. [indiscernible] It's really tougher to say.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Katzman (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then second question on the U.S. consumer business. Alan, I asked you last quarter, was the weakness that you had reported in the fourth quarter really just a function of core spice and seasonings or was it broader-based into things like Zatarain's and some of the grilling items, et cetera. Can you go into a little bit more detail? It sounds like this core spice and seasonings business was still pretty weak. But is that true with some of the other products as well or did you make improvement there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nWe're seeing improvement actually in our core spices and our recipe mixes. We're still seeing some weakness in some of those other brands, and some of it's driven by from our promotional plan from last year.  We were pretty heavy early in the year. Those are going to be more spread this year. Secondly, a little bit of a later Mardi Gras, and I never want to use weather as an excuse but we're seeing in Zatarain's, for instance, the cost of crawfish pretty high right now. We'd expect this to be coming into pretty heavy crawfish season and the weather has made that a little later. But fundamentally, what we're doing is driving behind our core business, which is our most profitable business and then over time, we're addressing the other businesses.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Katzman (Analysts)】\nYes, I'm going to have to keep better track of my crawfish pricing index.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nRight now, it's about $5. And in the middle of the season, it should be about $3.50. You're wondering why I know that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Katzman (Analysts)】\nAnd then just a quick follow-up and I'll pass it on. The -- I think you mentioned that you had put more money behind the Gourmet line. Is that -- and that's -- I guess that's your highest price point amongst -- in the core spices business. Did I hear that correctly, and is that kind of the response to the -- some of the other spice products being available in other aisles of the store and that's kind of, at least initially, how you intend to combat the new competitors in various outlets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nWell, we segment the consumer in a couple of different ways. One is by price points, the other is by how involved they are in cooking. And Gourmet is the involved cook who wants the best product. And so we are supporting and differentiating our product based on our freshness and unique sourcing on those products. So there is -- that is 1 part and 1 segment that we are going after. The other part of that is the more core and value-priced consumer. We have some other programs to try to address that. And then later in the year, we have some -- a relaunch of our Gourmet products that we're expecting to roll out.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Akshay Jagdale (Analysts)】\nI wanted to ask about the comment you made on the consumer -- U.S. consumer segment. You said you were seeing early signs of some improvement, I believe that's what you said. Can you give us some color on that? I mean, what is it exactly that you're seeing that makes you feel that way?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nWe're seeing our share gap closing with our core spices. We're seeing growth and actually share gains in our recipe mixes. And we are seeing a flattening of share from some of those fragmented competitors that we talked about. Private label continues to gain, but the regional and smaller competitors are flattening out of it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Akshay Jagdale (Analysts)】\nOkay. And in terms of your decision to continue to spend heavily behind that? I mean, can you give us some sense, I mean, you already had a pretty dominant share of voice in that segment or category.  Can you talk about returns you're seeing on the incremental dollars you're spending? Are they still pretty high returns and better than the industry average for every incremental $1 that you're spending on advertising?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nYes, we're still continuing to see pretty strong ROIs based on the spending that we have. And in fact, advertising and our digital programs have much higher ROIs than the promotional spend that we were doing. We got a little heavy, I think, over the last year, in promotional spend and not all of those were great paybacks and didn't build equity. So we're -- we've adjusted our spending -- away from promotions. But we've adjusted our spending to more focus on equity-building.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Akshay Jagdale (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just one last one on the Kohinoor acquisition. If you just take a step back, can you summarize sort of how that acquisition has performed since you bought it? There's been some puts and takes. And then just give us a sense of where you are really.  Are you in the first or second inning of your strategy to introduce new products through that distribution chain? So perhaps what may have gone -- what may have happened that's worse than your expectations so far? And then sort of where are we now relative to your broader longer-term plan in India?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nWe're -- I think we're in the early stages of our plan in India. The things that we have done over the last year, we didn't acquire the full supply chain for that business in India because what we wanted was the retail presence and the ability to drive other products through that chain. What we've done over the last year has been to beef up our own supply chain to improve our service levels and to get better control of our inventory. We're focused on continuing to build our capabilities there and to start to introduce those new products. We have those products in place now and we're starting to roll those out. We've got a distribution chain in place. We expect to continue to see it grow but again, to remind you of our strategy in emerging markets, we have a tendency to pay-as-we-go. So we're not going to get out over the tips of our skiis and invest and lose a lot of money in a market until we're sure we have the infrastructure to support it. And then we'll pay it and expand as we go. That's exactly what we did in China. That's what we're doing in India. I would say, you asked how it's performing.  It's performing below our expectations at this point but we feel like we've got the right plans to address it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Growe (Analysts)】\nI just had 2 questions for you. The first one, if I could ask, is a bit of a follow-on to Dave Driscoll's question about 2Q, but how -- I guess, I also had been planning on a bit of an Easter shift into Q2 as well. Is that occurring -- you talked about how much of a benefit it is -- sorry, excuse me if I missed that, but I want to get a better sense of how much that could help 2Q?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gordon Stetz (Executives)】\nYes, that's a difficult one to predict, Chris, quite honestly. And we haven't talked about that and certainly our internal forecast, which is guiding us towards the direction we're giving you now has accounted for that. But I couldn't quantify that for sure for you right now.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nYes, there's some shift in timing and it could have an impact, but our current outlook is exactly what Gordon says.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Growe (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then did you cite how much emerging market growth you had this quarter? What sort of dollars sales growth did you see in those markets? Was that a significant contributor to the second quarter -- to the first quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gordon Stetz (Executives)】\nWell, certainly, the Wuhan acquisition is emerging markets. So we broke that out for you separately and we talked about China being up 20% and also, on the consumer side and double-digit on the industrial side. So we're talking double-digit type increases on the emerging markets side. So it was a big help and that was one of the outperformers on the quarter relative to our expectations.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nBut it drove a lot of consumer growth rate.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gordon Stetz (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Growe (Analysts)】\nOkay. If I could maybe just squeeze 1 more in relation to the marketing. Did more of the marketing this quarter go towards Europe? And it looks like you got a pretty significant increase there and you think you'll spread it more towards the U.S. in the second quarter? Just curious how the phasing will go in between divisions.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gordon Stetz (Executives)】\nNo, Europe was up about 38%, but 1/2 the marketing increase spend was in the U.S.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenneth Goldman (Analysts)】\nA couple of questions. First, as you look into the summer and you see much higher meat costs approaching, just curious how that affects your marketing plan in any way for grilling? And second, it looks like Cerberus will be on track to buy Safeway here. If that deal goes through, do you expect it will affect your distribution in any way? I'm just curious if you're stronger with either of those customers?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nIn terms of meat costs, because of our grilling portfolio has a wide range of products that are good for a wide range of meat, even if the consumer starts trading from fillets to cheaper custom meat or even the burgers, a lot of our innovation actually are the burger mixes. So what we're hoping -- what we think will impact us more is the return to a more normal weather. We're really hoping for some better weather as we kind of head into the Memorial Day weekend. But our products will span across the broad range of whether it's pork or chicken or hamburger. Obviously, our Montreal Steak is great on steaks and we hope the consumers will continue to buy. But we think we're well-positioned no matter what's happening across the broad portfolio. In terms of the Safeway, Albertsons acquisition merger, we have a good position with both those customers. And so we're not anticipating this to have a significant impact on our business. We do have a strong relationship with both of them. As long as they're driving to win in the marketplace, we believe that's good for us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Lazar (Analysts)】\nTwo questions from me. The first one, obviously, you talked about seeing some of the early signs, and I guess I was under the impression, and it's probably still the case, that this kind of turnaround in the U.S. consumer is still going to take some time. But I guess things are reacting maybe positively a little more quickly than maybe I had thought. Is it fair to say that the brand equity building part is what's currently driving some of those early signs? And the winning at retail piece is going to take more time or is that not the right way to look at it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nI think that's kind of the right way to look at it. It is -- and I don't want to get over optimistic because we know it's going to take some time, but we are doing exactly what we said we're going to do. We're outselling our message with retailers.  That is a customer-by-customer and, in some cases, region-by-region approach that's going to take some time. And frankly, it's never done because when we present something that works for us, the competitor's in there presenting something else as well. But so that's going to be a longer side of it. But we immediately changed our focus into building consumer equity and we're starting to see some of the benefits of that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Lazar (Analysts)】\nIn terms of the winning at retail piece, even though it's very early, are there any maybe anecdotal thoughts you can share with maybe how some of those conversations have gone? I mean, are you seeing traction where you've had some conversations in sort of communicating with retailers where this just kind of makes sense and where some of their actions maybe don't make as much sense for them?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nYes, we are seeing, certainly, varying degrees of acceptance and action in the store from that. But what we're really showing them is the best way to grow their sales and profits in this category and benefiting from the fact that the best way to grow their sales and profits is the same thing that works for us, which is to sell more higher-turning McCormick SKUs as opposed to lower-turning, cheaper alternative products.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Lazar (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then last quarter on the call, we talked a little bit about how you were looking at potentially some different options in order to address the consumer trends, both at the sort of the value line and the premium line, and potentially could include thinking about, let's say, a different line for sort of a value line, let's say. Maybe it's under the McCormick name, maybe it's under sort of a different name or somehow related. But I didn't know if there are any conclusions you came to with respect to how to address that and if there were going to be some other new items there maybe along those lines that we just haven't seen yet?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nYes, we are working on some premium solutions, as well as some more value solutions. We already have a number of offerings in the value range. And our strategy with those is to meet a customer need, but not necessarily -- because those don't necessary drive traffic and they don't necessarily drive profitability for the retail or for us, but they're there to meet a customer need. We have a number of those offerings and we're continuing to evaluate what the right value offerings are. But premium, we've got some very concrete plans.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Philip Terpolilli (Analysts)】\nJust 2 quick questions. Maybe one last on China here and we can put it to rest. But the quarter was quite strong. Do you feel like you're starting to get more of a mass there now in terms of maybe distribution wins, getting a little bit easier than 12 months earlier? And then just maybe building on that, are there more M&A opportunities that can further accelerate things there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nYes, we certainly feel good that we're building scale in our consumer business in China. Our core business has continued to grow pretty strongly and then Wuhan, WAPC is an accelerator to that because it gives us access to a much bigger sales force in a different part of the country than where we've been. So that's why we made the acquisition. We do see -- we see other opportunities for acquisition, not just in that market but in a number of the markets that we targeted. So we have a pretty good outlook and a pretty good pipeline for those kinds of acquisitions.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Philip Terpolilli (Analysts)】\nOkay. I mean, is the pipeline pretty similar to what you've seen in the last 12 or 18 months or kind of getting better or worse?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nI would say the pipeline itself is pretty similar and whether it comes to closure is another question, but the pipeline is pretty similar is what we've seen.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Philip Terpolilli (Analysts)】\nSure. That's helpful. And then just 1 quick question, if I could. On the input cost front, any update on what you're seeing?  I saw the low single-digit guide in the slide deck, but I know your bucket's a little bit different than some of the other CPG group and can be a little bit more volatile at times. So any additional color on things to maybe watch out for this year that you're seeing right now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nThe things that we see that are starting to move up are, as you probably have seen in corn and wheat, and soybeans and dairy are starting to move up a bit. So those impact us more on the industrial side of our business. I wouldn't say that we have any significant changes on the consumer side.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nI'd like to thank you for your questions and for participating today. McCormick's 2014 fiscal year is off to a good start. Our strategic imperatives around people, growth and performance are driving sales, delivering CCI cost savings, which is our fuel for growth, and generating higher profits and strong cash flow. At McCormick, we bring the joy of flavor to every day. Our 125 year heritage of innovation, collaboration and commitment to this business is at the foundation of our global leadership in flavor and has us well-positioned for the future. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Joyce Brooks (Executives)】\nThanks, Alan. I'd also like to thank those on this morning's call. Through April 1, a replay of the call can be accessed by dialing (855) 859-2056. The ID number is 22127582. You can also listen to the replay on our website later today.

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's fiscal 2014 third quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website, investors.nikeinc.com.\r\nJoining us on today's call will be NIKE Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker; followed by Trevor Edwards, President of the NIKE Brand; and finally, you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thanks for your cooperation on this. \r\nI'll now turn the call over to NIKE Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Kelley, and hello, everybody. Q3 was a strong quarter for NIKE. Even in the face of challenging macroeconomic conditions, we delivered robust growth, and we did so in a well-balanced way across our entire portfolio. By the numbers, here are the highlights: NIKE Inc. revenues grew 13% to $7 billion. Gross margins increased 30 basis points to 44.5%. SG&A rose 16%, reflecting strategic investments in our brands and our operations. And despite currency pressure, diluted EPS rose 4% to $0.76.\r\nWe delivered these results because of the breadth and depth of the NIKE Inc. portfolio. For a company that does business in more than 190 countries, volatility is a fact of life. Although NIKE Inc.'s global reach increases the complexity of our business, it also presents us with the opportunity to leverage strength in certain areas while we continue to invest in others. Because our portfolio includes a diverse set of categories, geographies, products, brands and distribution channels, we are best positioned to manage through an ever-changing macro environment.\r\nOur deep connection with the consumers ensures we focus our innovation on products and services that consumers expect and also on those that they never thought possible. And our commitment to operational excellence in our supply chain, in our financial management and in our resource allocation ensures we remain laser focused on driving profitable, sustainable growth. While we're not immune to the macroeconomic environment, we certainly have a management team that knows the terrain and can effectively drive growth in various conditions. And that is why I am so confident in NIKE's ability to create shareholder value.\r\nWhile the NIKE portfolio is diverse, there is a common theme: it's powered by innovation. We don't innovate just for the sake of change. We do it with a clear purpose, and that's to help athletes reach their full potential. The breakthrough performance products we develop with insights from the world's best athletes become the must-have performance in sportswear products for consumers, and global sports moments continue to present the perfect opportunity for us to showcase our innovation. When the world's greatest athletes compete on a global stage, we're inspired to create some of our most exciting and game-changing products, and we can connect our brands to consumers when the world is watching.\r\nI want to highlight 3 examples from Q3: first, for the Super Bowl in New York, we launched an array of innovative footwear and apparel for the NFL's biggest moment. In footwear, we debuted the Vapor Carbon Elite Cleat designed for speed and quick cuts. As part of our long-term commitment to take advantage of the most advanced manufacturing processes, we leveraged NIKE's state-of-the-art 3D printing capabilities to inspire this revolutionary new cleat, which we put on the field in record time for football's ultimate game. As we do with all of our innovations, we plan to expand the transformative benefits of 3D printing across multiple areas of our business. \r\nIn apparel, we launched the Silver Speed Collection of on-field, sideline, training and Sportswear products, including the Aeroloft Summit Jacket, which is constructed to be lightweight and breathable. Worn by players on the sidelines, the jacket made a great statement of brand innovation in a game that was seen by over 110 million viewers. And for the fans, we updated the NIKE NFL limited jersey, combining on-field innovation with premium style to give consumers an authentic way to express their love of the game.\r\nNext, the Winter Olympics, which featured incredible displays of athleticism and accomplishment. NIKE was on the ice as both Canadian men's and women's hockey teams took gold wearing our lightweight game jersey. The jersey leveraged innovations from across our categories, including Nike Flywire, a technology originally developed for basketball footwear. The Olympic hockey jersey provides another example of how we take innovations developed for one category and share them not only across categories but also across product types. \r\nThe U.S. Team medal stand apparel featured our Aeroloft 800 Summit Jacket. So it was a privilege to be there when U.S. athletes like snowboarder, Sage Kotsenburg, who won gold in slopestyle, celebrated their greatest achievements in front of a global audience. \r\nIn the Olympic Village and at the many sport venues, NIKE athletes also wore our Tech Fleece, with its technical performance elements to provide lightweight warmth. Both Tech Fleece and the Aeroloft Summit Jacket quickly become go-to apparel items for consumers.\r\nAnd then, of course, in the run-up to World Cup, you've seen us launch an impressive collection of cutting-edge Football products: the Hypervenom boot with the NIKESKIN mesh upper that provides an amazing level of ball feel; the Hi-Vis boot designed to help footballers see teammates quickly and make critical plays; 10 new national team kits, featuring NIKE Dri-FIT technology for better cooling and our lightest NIKE Pro base layer ever; and the Tiempo Legend V with Nike Hypershield technology to give this leather boot incredible all-weather performance. \r\nAnd just 2 weeks ago, Trevor and I were in Barcelona to introduce a new standard in performance football boots, the Magista. With a radical new silhouette, the boot is designed to enhance player fit, touch and traction for a game that has become faster and more intense. The Magista was a result of 4 years of work in our sports research lab, incorporating insights from the world's best football athletes, including Barcelona's Andres Iniesta and Paris Saint-Germain's Thiago Silva. This is the first football boot to utilize Nike Flyknit technology, something many thought impossible. \r\nWe didn't set out to invent a Flyknit football boot, but we listened to our athletes and harnessed Flyknit's power to reimagine what football boots could be. We've used Flyknit to revolutionize running and basketball, and now we've done the same with football, which is exactly what you'd expect from NIKE.\r\nWhen it comes to innovation, we pride ourselves on being the pacesetter. We get out in front and we stay on the offense. The World Cup is now just a few months away and you can expect even more excitement leading up to the opening match in São Paulo. Products we've launched so far take the game of football to a new level. And before the first whistle in Brazil, we will have more amazing products to come. Football is the biggest sport in the world, and NIKE is the leader in innovation for athletes. That's a combination that drives us to deliver bolder innovation for the World Cup than we've ever done before, so stay tuned.\r\nSo these are just a few of the innovations that represent who we are as a company, and they demonstrate our commitment to athletes and how we drive growth across our portfolio of businesses. And because we're NIKE, we just don't innovate for the present, we innovate for the future. The steps we're taking with digital, Flyknit and 3D printing technologies and with new materials and methods of manufacturing are driving us to improve performance and achieve new levels of sustainability. When I considered these steps, it's clear to me that NIKE has more capacity to innovate in more dramatic ways than ever before. \r\nThe opportunities are truly unlimited, but our resources are not. As a result, we are relentless editors. Because innovation isn't about just doing more, it's about doing things better. It's about staying sharply focused on the opportunities that have the highest potential for growth, and that's how we unlock our true potential. There is never an off-season for NIKE. We will continue to leverage the power of our portfolio and the power of innovation to connect with our consumers and create long-term shareholder value. \r\nSo thanks, everyone, and now here's Trevor to discuss the NIKE Brand.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Mark. The NIKE Brand delivered another strong quarter as our innovative products, compelling consumer connections and effective marketplace management continued to drive the growth. On a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand global revenue increased 14%, with growth across all geographies and key categories, including double-digit growth in our largest categories of Sportswear, Running and Basketball. The NIKE Brand DTC grew 23%, driven by 10% comp store growth and an impressive 57% growth in online sales, as our digital investments and sharper merchandising increased traffic, conversion and average order on nike.com. And finally, global futures grew a robust 14%.\r\nThese strong results are driven, as always, by our relentless focus on the consumer. Consumers worldwide expect and demand cutting-edge products, engaging consumer experiences and a powerful retail presentations. NIKE's ability to deliver on all 3 strengthens our position as the brand of choice with consumers and builds our business around the world. To see these dynamics in action, let's first take a look at Running.\r\nRunning is our heritage and our largest performance category. But as we like to say at NIKE, \"There is no finish line.\" And that is certainly true of this -- of the Running business, which continued to deliver strong results, with revenue growing at a double-digit rate in Q3. That growth is fueled by our steadfast focus on bringing innovation to the market. \r\nIn Running footwear, we expanded our breakthrough Flyknit platform. The new Flyknit Air Max combines Flyknit with an improved Max Air to create lightweight, well-conditioned -- well-cushioned running shoe. Also resonating with consumers is the resilient ultralight Flyknit Lunar2, with its supportive Lunarlon cushioning. And in Running apparel, which is also fueling growth in the category, we continue to gain share with our new Dri-FIT Knit products. The Running shirts with their softer, high-stretch knit are bestsellers in the market.\r\nWe also drive growth by targeting our resources against the biggest opportunities. A great example of this is Women's Running, an important pillar of our Women's amplified strategy. That strategy is working, and our Women's business grew faster than our Men's business, again, in quarter 3. \r\nA key element of this strategy is the Nike Training Club. This concept within NIKE stores offers cross-merchandise collections from Women's Running, Training and Sportswear and a high level of service dedicated to helping our consumer achieve her goals. We continue to see strong consumer response to this retail concept and expect to have nearly 50 locations globally by the end of fiscal year '14. These retail successes, combined with strong wholesale partnerships like the Nike Track Club at Finish Line, are growing the Running market, not just our share.\r\nThe other performance category I'd like to discuss is Basketball. Both the NIKE and Jordan's brands continue to deliver the very best in Basketball, with innovative products and groundbreaking experiences. Q3 was the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for our Basketball category. And as the game becomes increasingly global, this growth story is just getting started.\r\nOur continued success in Basketball is the result of creating the game's most cutting-edge products. Our lightweight and breathable Hyper Elite uniforms provide NIKE college teams a new level of performance, just in time for March Madness. \r\nIn footwear, the power of our innovation engine is on full display with the LEBRON 11, the KD 6 and the KOBE 9 Elite, which, since its launch, has sold out at nearly every location as soon as it arrives. And our new Hyper Elite fanatical socks have become a popular performance item, which speaks to the opportunity NIKE has in expanding the market by creating new segments. \r\nThese products come to life in retail experiences that express a deep love of the game, serving those who share that passion. All over the globe, NIKE is driving and growing the Basketball market from our own DTC stores to Foot Locker's House of Hoops.\r\nLikewise, the Jordan Brand leads by combining innovation with a unique sense of style that speaks to the legacy of Michael Jordan. Quarter 3 included important Jordan milestones. The largest 1-day product launch in the brand's history with the release of the latest Air Jordan 11 and the debut of the exciting new retail concept. In partnership with Footaction, we opened the first-ever, Jordan-only store in New York City called Flight 23. Jordan athletes, Earl Thomas and Carmelo Anthony, visited the store at the opening and gave it rave reviews. Consumers agree, with initial results exceeding expectations.\r\nThe final category I want to touch on is Sportswear. We often talk about our three-pronged Amplify strategy of compete, train and express. Sportswear represents the express portion of that equation. It is a key element of the product assortment for our performance categories and offers consumers premium, sports-inspired products to express their love of the game. With new silhouettes, fabrics and styling, we have elevated the quality and technical innovation in traditional sportswear styles, resulting in the category delivering double-digit growth in Q3.\r\nLet me now turn to a few of our geographies. First, the emerging markets. This diverse portfolio offers significant growth opportunity today and well into the future. For the quarter, revenue was up 19% and futures were up 24%. So let's start with a quick update on Mexico. \r\nWe continue to work with our third-party logistic provider to resolve the distribution challenges I discussed last quarter. While we still have work to do, we shipped to demand in Q3. Over the next couple of quarters, we will continue to refine our processes and work to clear any excess inventory. Meanwhile, consumer demand for our product in Mexico remains strong, and we're working closely with our wholesale partners to properly manage the flow of product into the marketplace.\r\nNow across the rest of the emerging markets, we saw 7 of our 9 territories reporting double-digit revenue growth. As Mark described, this summer, the entire world will see the full power of the brand with game-changing products, compelling retail presentations and inspiring campaigns as we lead up to the World Cup in Brazil. By amplifying the power of sport, we grow our business in the emerging markets and all around the world.\r\nIn North America, our category offense continues to drive growth across every category, with Q3 revenues up 12%. The NIKE Brand continues to be incredibly strong in North America as demonstrated by our 9% futures growth. And last month, the Super Bowl provided an incredible energy point for the brand. As Mark mentioned, we drove excitement in the marketplace with innovative products and elevated retail experiences, which included both DTC locations and our wholesale partners, such as Fieldhouse at Dick's Sporting Goods and also the Yardline at Champs. As I said before, NIKE is in the business of making big moments bigger, which is exactly what we did, and we couldn't be happier with the results.\r\nIn Greater China, revenue grew 7%. Our strategy to reset the marketplace for profitable, long-term growth is working, and we are creating more productive retail with focused product assortments that strengthen our position as the #1 performance sport brand. Our results for Q3 reflect progress against that strategy. We work with our wholesale partners to better balance supply and demand, and we have made changes to the supply chain that are improving inventory levels in the marketplace.\r\nIn DTC, where we've tested and deployed new merchandising concepts, results remain strong, revenue up 27% with comp growth of 11% and expanding margins. And our wholesale partners are seeing positive results in their re-profiled doors, which continue to outpace the rest of the fleet. \r\nWe still have work to do in China -- in our China reset, but we feel great about our progress. These efforts are improving our business today. And importantly, they set a strong foundation for our long-term profitable growth in China, and we continue to see tremendous growth opportunity in this key geography.\r\nLastly, let me turn to the Western Europe, where revenue accelerated to 19% and futures were up 30%, with reported EBIT up 54%. Growth was broad-based from both a category and a territory perspective. Revenues in the U.K. and AGS, which is comprised of Austria, Germany and Switzerland, were up double digits for the second quarter in a row. From a category perspective, we saw double-digit growth across our largest performance categories: Running, Football, Basketball and Women's Training. Notably, Sportswear also grew double digits, which amplifies our performance positioning.\r\nOur DTC operations, which continued to strengthen NIKE's brand positioning and drive growth, were up 29%, driven by 14% comp store growth and a strong growth online. And lastly, EBIT results were also driven by expanding gross margins, reflecting a clean marketplace and a strong sell-through of new styles. \r\nThe success in Western Europe is no surprise. By restructuring our business 2 years ago, we now work closer with our wholesale partners to better segment and differentiate the market. Our work to transform the marketplace with our own DTC locations and key retail partners, such as JD Sports and Foot Locker, has improved the experience for our consumers. All told, we've strengthened our brand and expanded the potential of our business, and we're just getting started.\r\nLooking forward, I am confident in what NIKE Brand is bringing to consumers and the connections we're making with them. I like where we are and, better yet, I like where we're headed. Thanks, Don.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Trevor. As Mark and Trevor both discussed, our Q3 and year-to-date growth was strong and well balanced, driven by expansion across nearly every dimension of our global portfolio. These results were particularly noteworthy, given the stiff currency headwinds we faced and our significant investments in future growth. It's the strength and diversity of our portfolio, expanding multiple brands, categories, geographies, products and channels, which enables us to consistently deliver growth and manage risk. As always, our growth is to deliver profitable growth in the near term while continuing to make the investments that will sustain that growth into the future. Striking this balance puts us in the best position to continue to create shareholder value over the long term, despite the volatility that's an inherent aspect of a global business.\r\nWith that introduction, I'll now recap our Q3 results. Third quarter reported revenue for NIKE Inc. increased 13%. On a currency-neutral basis, both NIKE Inc. and NIKE Brand revenues increased 14%. This was above our expectations as strong demand, particularly in North America, pulled some Q4 futures orders into Q3. \r\nConverse revenues increased 16% on a constant currency basis. Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders increased 14%, driven by a 9% increase in units and a 5% increase in average selling price. The increase was led by extraordinary growth in the emerging markets and Western Europe, as well as double-digit growth in the Football, Basketball and Women's Training categories. On a reported basis, futures grew 12%, reflecting weaker developing market currencies.\r\nThird quarter diluted EPS increased 4% to $0.76, driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by higher year-over-year SG&A investments and headwinds from weaker developing market currencies. We estimate changes in currency exchange rates reduced our EPS growth by 6 percentage points for the third quarter and 9 percentage points year-to-date. We expect FX headwinds will continue to reduce our EPS growth rate for Q4 and into fiscal 2015.\r\nGross margin for the third quarter increased 30 basis points, driven by higher average prices and continued strength of our DTC business, partially offset by product cost inflation and FX headwinds. \r\nThird quarter SG&A spending rose 16%, reflecting 18% growth in demand creation, driven by support for the launch of new products, the ramp-up to the World Cup and investments to upgrade the presentation of our products in wholesale accounts. The level of spending was slightly lower than we projected last quarter, as we shifted some investments for World Cup initiatives to Q4.\r\nOperating overhead grew 15%, reflecting investments in infrastructure, supply chain capabilities, DTC and digital. As Trevor mentioned, we're seeing significant acceleration in nike.com growth as a result of the investments we've made earlier. And we plan to continue to fund these initiatives to realize our significant global potential in digital commerce. Other expense net was $45 million for the quarter, driven largely by FX conversion losses in developing markets, most notably, Argentina.\r\nThe third quarter effective tax rate was 22.4%, a 40-basis-point improvement versus the prior year, primarily due to an increase in earnings from our operations outside of the U.S., which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. This was partially offset by the comparison to a prior-year benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. R&D credit.\r\nOur balance sheet continues to be in great shape, and our cash conversion cycle continues to improve. As of the end of Q3, accounts receivable grew just 4% versus last year, well below the rate of revenue growth. Inventories were up 12%, in line with the growth in futures. As a result, our trailing 4-quarter return on invested capital was 24.2%, 120 basis points above last year and well within our mid-20s target range.\r\nNow let's take a look at our Q3 performance by segment. In North America, revenue increased 12% on both a reported and constant-currency basis, driven by double-digit growth across nearly all key categories led by Basketball, Sportswear, Men's and Women's Training and Global Football. DTC revenue grew 19% in the quarter, driven by 8% comp sales growth in stores and significantly higher sales for nike.com. On a reported basis, Q3 EBIT for North America grew 11% due to strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by higher demand creation spending to support new product launches.\r\nIn Western Europe, revenue grew 19% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting strength across our portfolio of businesses. Revenue grew double digits for every key category, except Action Sports; and every territory, except Italy. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue increased 22% and EBIT increased 54%, driven by revenue growth, significant gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. \r\nRevenue for Central and Eastern Europe grew 22% on a currency-neutral basis, as every territory, except Israel, reported higher revenues. In Russia, Turkey, Poland and Greece, revenues grew at a double-digit pace. Revenue was also higher in every key category. On a reported basis, revenue grew 17%, while EBIT increased 23%, as revenue growth and gross margin expansion more than offset higher demand creation spending related to the Winter Olympics.\r\nIn Greater China, we continue to see encouraging signs as our market reset actions take hold. In Q3, currency-neutral revenue grew 7%, led by expansion in Sportswear, Basketball and Running. On a reported, Greater China revenue grew 9% and EBIT increased 7%, as revenue growth and gross margin expansion were partially offset by higher SG&A spending, reflecting investments in our new China headquarters facility and DTC operations.\r\nOne of our key objectives in resetting the China market is to increase the productivity and profitability of our retail spaces. As Trevor mentioned, comp sales for our DTC stores grew 11% in Q3 and, equally important, margins expanded significantly. Comp store sales for partner-operated NIKE stores that we've reset with more focused assortments also continued to grow at a double-digit pace, well above the fleet average. \r\nWe're very encouraged by the Q3 results in China. That said, not all of our financial metrics in China will improve in a linear fashion, as we optimize the flow of product into the market. As a result of planned changes in our seasonal product flow, futures are down 3% on a currency-neutral basis, and we anticipate Q4 revenue will be flat to slightly down.\r\nOur business in Japan continued to generate positive momentum, with 10% currency-neutral revenue growth, driven by higher revenues in nearly every key category. On a reported basis, Japan revenue declined 9% and EBIT fell 13%, reflecting the impact of the weaker yen, as well as increased SG&A spending behind the launch of nike.com in Japan.\r\nIn our emerging markets geography, currency-neutral revenues grew 19%, reflecting broad-based growth across virtually every business unit. Revenues for nearly every category increased double digits, led by Running, Football and Sportswear. And almost every territory in the geography also reported double-digit revenue growth, led by Brazil, Mexico and our Soco territory, which includes Argentina, Uruguay and Chile.\r\nOn a reported basis, revenue in the emerging markets grew 8% and EBIT increased 6%, reflecting the significant adverse impact of currency devaluations, as well as higher SG&A spending on infrastructure and DTC.\r\nFor the Converse brand, Q3 revenue grew 16% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis, driven by continued strength in direct distribution markets, particularly the United States, China and the U.K. The Chuck Taylor franchise continues to deliver sustained, profitable growth, and we're making progress extending the Converse brand in footwear and apparel. We're also developing the marketplace for the Converse brand by enhancing presentation in wholesale accounts, expanding DTC and transitioning new countries to direct distribution. So far this year, we've converted Scandinavia and Taiwan to direct distribution, and we're preparing for additional conversions in FY '15, laying the foundation for continued strong growth.\r\nOn a reported basis, EBIT increased 10% as higher revenue and gross margins were partially offset by increased SG&A investments in demand creation, infrastructure and DTC.\r\nThe NIKE Inc. portfolio has delivered strong performance year-to-date, and we expect to see continued momentum in our business as we finish the fiscal year. However, as I mentioned earlier, FX headwinds have been a significant drag on EPS growth so far this year, and we expect to face ongoing pressure in Q4 and into next year. Our guidance for Q4 and FY '15 incorporates the expected impact of these headwinds.\r\nWe now expect Q4 revenue to grow at a high single-digit rate. This is below the rate of futures growth, largely due to the timing of shipments at the beginning and end of Q4, as well as lower levels of at-once and closeout sales. For the full year, we now expect revenue growth at the top end of our high single-digit target range. We now expect gross margin for Q4 to expand by 50 to 75 basis points, somewhat better than our prior expectations due to a shift in mix to higher-margin products and geographies, as well as ongoing strength in our higher-margin DTC business.\r\nFor the full year, we expect gross margin expansion of about 90 basis points. For Q4, we now expect SG&A to grow at a high-teens rate. As I stated previously, we rephased a portion of our demand creation from Q3 to Q4, strengthening our World Cup marketing initiatives. Given that shift and a relatively lower level of spend in the fourth quarter of FY '13, we expect Q4 demand creation growth of over 30%.\r\nWe expect Q4 operating overhead to grow at a low double-digit rate, reflecting ongoing investments in strategic initiatives, such as digital and DTC. For the full year, we continue to expect SG&A to grow at a low-teens rate. For FY '14, we now expect the effective tax rate will be around 24%.\r\nWe haven't yet completed our planning for FY '15 but can provide some initial thoughts. We expect to see continued strong momentum in our business and anticipate currency-neutral revenue growth for FY '15 at or slightly above our high single-digit target range. That said, this year's devaluation of developing market currencies will be a significant drag on next year's reported revenue, gross margin and profit growth. In addition, we remain committed to investing in the strategies that are driving our growth. As a result, we expect FY '15 EPS growth will be somewhat below our mid-teens target range.\r\nAs Mark said at the top of the call, we feel great about the strong results we've delivered through the first 3 quarters of this fiscal year. As we look ahead to Q4 and FY '15, we'll continue to make strategic investments to drive sustainable, long-term growth while capitalizing on those investments we've already made to deliver consistent profitability and cash returns to our shareholders.\r\nWe're now ready to take your questions.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nThank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's fiscal 2014 third quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website, investors.nikeinc.com.\r\nJoining us on today's call will be NIKE Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker; followed by Trevor Edwards, President of the NIKE Brand; and finally, you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thanks for your cooperation on this. \r\nI'll now turn the call over to NIKE Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nThank you, Kelley, and hello, everybody. Q3 was a strong quarter for NIKE. Even in the face of challenging macroeconomic conditions, we delivered robust growth, and we did so in a well-balanced way across our entire portfolio. By the numbers, here are the highlights: NIKE Inc. revenues grew 13% to $7 billion. Gross margins increased 30 basis points to 44.5%. SG&A rose 16%, reflecting strategic investments in our brands and our operations. And despite currency pressure, diluted EPS rose 4% to $0.76.\r\nWe delivered these results because of the breadth and depth of the NIKE Inc. portfolio. For a company that does business in more than 190 countries, volatility is a fact of life. Although NIKE Inc.'s global reach increases the complexity of our business, it also presents us with the opportunity to leverage strength in certain areas while we continue to invest in others. Because our portfolio includes a diverse set of categories, geographies, products, brands and distribution channels, we are best positioned to manage through an ever-changing macro environment.\r\nOur deep connection with the consumers ensures we focus our innovation on products and services that consumers expect and also on those that they never thought possible. And our commitment to operational excellence in our supply chain, in our financial management and in our resource allocation ensures we remain laser focused on driving profitable, sustainable growth. While we're not immune to the macroeconomic environment, we certainly have a management team that knows the terrain and can effectively drive growth in various conditions. And that is why I am so confident in NIKE's ability to create shareholder value.\r\nWhile the NIKE portfolio is diverse, there is a common theme: it's powered by innovation. We don't innovate just for the sake of change. We do it with a clear purpose, and that's to help athletes reach their full potential. The breakthrough performance products we develop with insights from the world's best athletes become the must-have performance in sportswear products for consumers, and global sports moments continue to present the perfect opportunity for us to showcase our innovation. When the world's greatest athletes compete on a global stage, we're inspired to create some of our most exciting and game-changing products, and we can connect our brands to consumers when the world is watching.\r\nI want to highlight 3 examples from Q3: first, for the Super Bowl in New York, we launched an array of innovative footwear and apparel for the NFL's biggest moment. In footwear, we debuted the Vapor Carbon Elite Cleat designed for speed and quick cuts. As part of our long-term commitment to take advantage of the most advanced manufacturing processes, we leveraged NIKE's state-of-the-art 3D printing capabilities to inspire this revolutionary new cleat, which we put on the field in record time for football's ultimate game. As we do with all of our innovations, we plan to expand the transformative benefits of 3D printing across multiple areas of our business. \r\nIn apparel, we launched the Silver Speed Collection of on-field, sideline, training and Sportswear products, including the Aeroloft Summit Jacket, which is constructed to be lightweight and breathable. Worn by players on the sidelines, the jacket made a great statement of brand innovation in a game that was seen by over 110 million viewers. And for the fans, we updated the NIKE NFL limited jersey, combining on-field innovation with premium style to give consumers an authentic way to express their love of the game.\r\nNext, the Winter Olympics, which featured incredible displays of athleticism and accomplishment. NIKE was on the ice as both Canadian men's and women's hockey teams took gold wearing our lightweight game jersey. The jersey leveraged innovations from across our categories, including Nike Flywire, a technology originally developed for basketball footwear. The Olympic hockey jersey provides another example of how we take innovations developed for one category and share them not only across categories but also across product types. \r\nThe U.S. Team medal stand apparel featured our Aeroloft 800 Summit Jacket. So it was a privilege to be there when U.S. athletes like snowboarder, Sage Kotsenburg, who won gold in slopestyle, celebrated their greatest achievements in front of a global audience. \r\nIn the Olympic Village and at the many sport venues, NIKE athletes also wore our Tech Fleece, with its technical performance elements to provide lightweight warmth. Both Tech Fleece and the Aeroloft Summit Jacket quickly become go-to apparel items for consumers.\r\nAnd then, of course, in the run-up to World Cup, you've seen us launch an impressive collection of cutting-edge Football products: the Hypervenom boot with the NIKESKIN mesh upper that provides an amazing level of ball feel; the Hi-Vis boot designed to help footballers see teammates quickly and make critical plays; 10 new national team kits, featuring NIKE Dri-FIT technology for better cooling and our lightest NIKE Pro base layer ever; and the Tiempo Legend V with Nike Hypershield technology to give this leather boot incredible all-weather performance. \r\nAnd just 2 weeks ago, Trevor and I were in Barcelona to introduce a new standard in performance football boots, the Magista. With a radical new silhouette, the boot is designed to enhance player fit, touch and traction for a game that has become faster and more intense. The Magista was a result of 4 years of work in our sports research lab, incorporating insights from the world's best football athletes, including Barcelona's Andres Iniesta and Paris Saint-Germain's Thiago Silva. This is the first football boot to utilize Nike Flyknit technology, something many thought impossible. \r\nWe didn't set out to invent a Flyknit football boot, but we listened to our athletes and harnessed Flyknit's power to reimagine what football boots could be. We've used Flyknit to revolutionize running and basketball, and now we've done the same with football, which is exactly what you'd expect from NIKE.\r\nWhen it comes to innovation, we pride ourselves on being the pacesetter. We get out in front and we stay on the offense. The World Cup is now just a few months away and you can expect even more excitement leading up to the opening match in São Paulo. Products we've launched so far take the game of football to a new level. And before the first whistle in Brazil, we will have more amazing products to come. Football is the biggest sport in the world, and NIKE is the leader in innovation for athletes. That's a combination that drives us to deliver bolder innovation for the World Cup than we've ever done before, so stay tuned.\r\nSo these are just a few of the innovations that represent who we are as a company, and they demonstrate our commitment to athletes and how we drive growth across our portfolio of businesses. And because we're NIKE, we just don't innovate for the present, we innovate for the future. The steps we're taking with digital, Flyknit and 3D printing technologies and with new materials and methods of manufacturing are driving us to improve performance and achieve new levels of sustainability. When I considered these steps, it's clear to me that NIKE has more capacity to innovate in more dramatic ways than ever before. \r\nThe opportunities are truly unlimited, but our resources are not. As a result, we are relentless editors. Because innovation isn't about just doing more, it's about doing things better. It's about staying sharply focused on the opportunities that have the highest potential for growth, and that's how we unlock our true potential. There is never an off-season for NIKE. We will continue to leverage the power of our portfolio and the power of innovation to connect with our consumers and create long-term shareholder value. \r\nSo thanks, everyone, and now here's Trevor to discuss the NIKE Brand.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nThank you, Mark. The NIKE Brand delivered another strong quarter as our innovative products, compelling consumer connections and effective marketplace management continued to drive the growth. On a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand global revenue increased 14%, with growth across all geographies and key categories, including double-digit growth in our largest categories of Sportswear, Running and Basketball. The NIKE Brand DTC grew 23%, driven by 10% comp store growth and an impressive 57% growth in online sales, as our digital investments and sharper merchandising increased traffic, conversion and average order on nike.com. And finally, global futures grew a robust 14%.\r\nThese strong results are driven, as always, by our relentless focus on the consumer. Consumers worldwide expect and demand cutting-edge products, engaging consumer experiences and a powerful retail presentations. NIKE's ability to deliver on all 3 strengthens our position as the brand of choice with consumers and builds our business around the world. To see these dynamics in action, let's first take a look at Running.\r\nRunning is our heritage and our largest performance category. But as we like to say at NIKE, \"There is no finish line.\" And that is certainly true of this -- of the Running business, which continued to deliver strong results, with revenue growing at a double-digit rate in Q3. That growth is fueled by our steadfast focus on bringing innovation to the market. \r\nIn Running footwear, we expanded our breakthrough Flyknit platform. The new Flyknit Air Max combines Flyknit with an improved Max Air to create lightweight, well-conditioned -- well-cushioned running shoe. Also resonating with consumers is the resilient ultralight Flyknit Lunar2, with its supportive Lunarlon cushioning. And in Running apparel, which is also fueling growth in the category, we continue to gain share with our new Dri-FIT Knit products. The Running shirts with their softer, high-stretch knit are bestsellers in the market.\r\nWe also drive growth by targeting our resources against the biggest opportunities. A great example of this is Women's Running, an important pillar of our Women's amplified strategy. That strategy is working, and our Women's business grew faster than our Men's business, again, in quarter 3. \r\nA key element of this strategy is the Nike Training Club. This concept within NIKE stores offers cross-merchandise collections from Women's Running, Training and Sportswear and a high level of service dedicated to helping our consumer achieve her goals. We continue to see strong consumer response to this retail concept and expect to have nearly 50 locations globally by the end of fiscal year '14. These retail successes, combined with strong wholesale partnerships like the Nike Track Club at Finish Line, are growing the Running market, not just our share.\r\nThe other performance category I'd like to discuss is Basketball. Both the NIKE and Jordan's brands continue to deliver the very best in Basketball, with innovative products and groundbreaking experiences. Q3 was the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for our Basketball category. And as the game becomes increasingly global, this growth story is just getting started.\r\nOur continued success in Basketball is the result of creating the game's most cutting-edge products. Our lightweight and breathable Hyper Elite uniforms provide NIKE college teams a new level of performance, just in time for March Madness. \r\nIn footwear, the power of our innovation engine is on full display with the LEBRON 11, the KD 6 and the KOBE 9 Elite, which, since its launch, has sold out at nearly every location as soon as it arrives. And our new Hyper Elite fanatical socks have become a popular performance item, which speaks to the opportunity NIKE has in expanding the market by creating new segments. \r\nThese products come to life in retail experiences that express a deep love of the game, serving those who share that passion. All over the globe, NIKE is driving and growing the Basketball market from our own DTC stores to Foot Locker's House of Hoops.\r\nLikewise, the Jordan Brand leads by combining innovation with a unique sense of style that speaks to the legacy of Michael Jordan. Quarter 3 included important Jordan milestones. The largest 1-day product launch in the brand's history with the release of the latest Air Jordan 11 and the debut of the exciting new retail concept. In partnership with Footaction, we opened the first-ever, Jordan-only store in New York City called Flight 23. Jordan athletes, Earl Thomas and Carmelo Anthony, visited the store at the opening and gave it rave reviews. Consumers agree, with initial results exceeding expectations.\r\nThe final category I want to touch on is Sportswear. We often talk about our three-pronged Amplify strategy of compete, train and express. Sportswear represents the express portion of that equation. It is a key element of the product assortment for our performance categories and offers consumers premium, sports-inspired products to express their love of the game. With new silhouettes, fabrics and styling, we have elevated the quality and technical innovation in traditional sportswear styles, resulting in the category delivering double-digit growth in Q3.\r\nLet me now turn to a few of our geographies. First, the emerging markets. This diverse portfolio offers significant growth opportunity today and well into the future. For the quarter, revenue was up 19% and futures were up 24%. So let's start with a quick update on Mexico. \r\nWe continue to work with our third-party logistic provider to resolve the distribution challenges I discussed last quarter. While we still have work to do, we shipped to demand in Q3. Over the next couple of quarters, we will continue to refine our processes and work to clear any excess inventory. Meanwhile, consumer demand for our product in Mexico remains strong, and we're working closely with our wholesale partners to properly manage the flow of product into the marketplace.\r\nNow across the rest of the emerging markets, we saw 7 of our 9 territories reporting double-digit revenue growth. As Mark described, this summer, the entire world will see the full power of the brand with game-changing products, compelling retail presentations and inspiring campaigns as we lead up to the World Cup in Brazil. By amplifying the power of sport, we grow our business in the emerging markets and all around the world.\r\nIn North America, our category offense continues to drive growth across every category, with Q3 revenues up 12%. The NIKE Brand continues to be incredibly strong in North America as demonstrated by our 9% futures growth. And last month, the Super Bowl provided an incredible energy point for the brand. As Mark mentioned, we drove excitement in the marketplace with innovative products and elevated retail experiences, which included both DTC locations and our wholesale partners, such as Fieldhouse at Dick's Sporting Goods and also the Yardline at Champs. As I said before, NIKE is in the business of making big moments bigger, which is exactly what we did, and we couldn't be happier with the results.\r\nIn Greater China, revenue grew 7%. Our strategy to reset the marketplace for profitable, long-term growth is working, and we are creating more productive retail with focused product assortments that strengthen our position as the #1 performance sport brand. Our results for Q3 reflect progress against that strategy. We work with our wholesale partners to better balance supply and demand, and we have made changes to the supply chain that are improving inventory levels in the marketplace.\r\nIn DTC, where we've tested and deployed new merchandising concepts, results remain strong, revenue up 27% with comp growth of 11% and expanding margins. And our wholesale partners are seeing positive results in their re-profiled doors, which continue to outpace the rest of the fleet. \r\nWe still have work to do in China -- in our China reset, but we feel great about our progress. These efforts are improving our business today. And importantly, they set a strong foundation for our long-term profitable growth in China, and we continue to see tremendous growth opportunity in this key geography.\r\nLastly, let me turn to the Western Europe, where revenue accelerated to 19% and futures were up 30%, with reported EBIT up 54%. Growth was broad-based from both a category and a territory perspective. Revenues in the U.K. and AGS, which is comprised of Austria, Germany and Switzerland, were up double digits for the second quarter in a row. From a category perspective, we saw double-digit growth across our largest performance categories: Running, Football, Basketball and Women's Training. Notably, Sportswear also grew double digits, which amplifies our performance positioning.\r\nOur DTC operations, which continued to strengthen NIKE's brand positioning and drive growth, were up 29%, driven by 14% comp store growth and a strong growth online. And lastly, EBIT results were also driven by expanding gross margins, reflecting a clean marketplace and a strong sell-through of new styles. \r\nThe success in Western Europe is no surprise. By restructuring our business 2 years ago, we now work closer with our wholesale partners to better segment and differentiate the market. Our work to transform the marketplace with our own DTC locations and key retail partners, such as JD Sports and Foot Locker, has improved the experience for our consumers. All told, we've strengthened our brand and expanded the potential of our business, and we're just getting started.\r\nLooking forward, I am confident in what NIKE Brand is bringing to consumers and the connections we're making with them. I like where we are and, better yet, I like where we're headed. Thanks, Don.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nThank you, Trevor. As Mark and Trevor both discussed, our Q3 and year-to-date growth was strong and well balanced, driven by expansion across nearly every dimension of our global portfolio. These results were particularly noteworthy, given the stiff currency headwinds we faced and our significant investments in future growth. It's the strength and diversity of our portfolio, expanding multiple brands, categories, geographies, products and channels, which enables us to consistently deliver growth and manage risk. As always, our growth is to deliver profitable growth in the near term while continuing to make the investments that will sustain that growth into the future. Striking this balance puts us in the best position to continue to create shareholder value over the long term, despite the volatility that's an inherent aspect of a global business.\r\nWith that introduction, I'll now recap our Q3 results. Third quarter reported revenue for NIKE Inc. increased 13%. On a currency-neutral basis, both NIKE Inc. and NIKE Brand revenues increased 14%. This was above our expectations as strong demand, particularly in North America, pulled some Q4 futures orders into Q3. \r\nConverse revenues increased 16% on a constant currency basis. Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders increased 14%, driven by a 9% increase in units and a 5% increase in average selling price. The increase was led by extraordinary growth in the emerging markets and Western Europe, as well as double-digit growth in the Football, Basketball and Women's Training categories. On a reported basis, futures grew 12%, reflecting weaker developing market currencies.\r\nThird quarter diluted EPS increased 4% to $0.76, driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by higher year-over-year SG&A investments and headwinds from weaker developing market currencies. We estimate changes in currency exchange rates reduced our EPS growth by 6 percentage points for the third quarter and 9 percentage points year-to-date. We expect FX headwinds will continue to reduce our EPS growth rate for Q4 and into fiscal 2015.\r\nGross margin for the third quarter increased 30 basis points, driven by higher average prices and continued strength of our DTC business, partially offset by product cost inflation and FX headwinds. \r\nThird quarter SG&A spending rose 16%, reflecting 18% growth in demand creation, driven by support for the launch of new products, the ramp-up to the World Cup and investments to upgrade the presentation of our products in wholesale accounts. The level of spending was slightly lower than we projected last quarter, as we shifted some investments for World Cup initiatives to Q4.\r\nOperating overhead grew 15%, reflecting investments in infrastructure, supply chain capabilities, DTC and digital. As Trevor mentioned, we're seeing significant acceleration in nike.com growth as a result of the investments we've made earlier. And we plan to continue to fund these initiatives to realize our significant global potential in digital commerce. Other expense net was $45 million for the quarter, driven largely by FX conversion losses in developing markets, most notably, Argentina.\r\nThe third quarter effective tax rate was 22.4%, a 40-basis-point improvement versus the prior year, primarily due to an increase in earnings from our operations outside of the U.S., which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. This was partially offset by the comparison to a prior-year benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. R&D credit.\r\nOur balance sheet continues to be in great shape, and our cash conversion cycle continues to improve. As of the end of Q3, accounts receivable grew just 4% versus last year, well below the rate of revenue growth. Inventories were up 12%, in line with the growth in futures. As a result, our trailing 4-quarter return on invested capital was 24.2%, 120 basis points above last year and well within our mid-20s target range.\r\nNow let's take a look at our Q3 performance by segment. In North America, revenue increased 12% on both a reported and constant-currency basis, driven by double-digit growth across nearly all key categories led by Basketball, Sportswear, Men's and Women's Training and Global Football. DTC revenue grew 19% in the quarter, driven by 8% comp sales growth in stores and significantly higher sales for nike.com. On a reported basis, Q3 EBIT for North America grew 11% due to strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by higher demand creation spending to support new product launches.\r\nIn Western Europe, revenue grew 19% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting strength across our portfolio of businesses. Revenue grew double digits for every key category, except Action Sports; and every territory, except Italy. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue increased 22% and EBIT increased 54%, driven by revenue growth, significant gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. \r\nRevenue for Central and Eastern Europe grew 22% on a currency-neutral basis, as every territory, except Israel, reported higher revenues. In Russia, Turkey, Poland and Greece, revenues grew at a double-digit pace. Revenue was also higher in every key category. On a reported basis, revenue grew 17%, while EBIT increased 23%, as revenue growth and gross margin expansion more than offset higher demand creation spending related to the Winter Olympics.\r\nIn Greater China, we continue to see encouraging signs as our market reset actions take hold. In Q3, currency-neutral revenue grew 7%, led by expansion in Sportswear, Basketball and Running. On a reported, Greater China revenue grew 9% and EBIT increased 7%, as revenue growth and gross margin expansion were partially offset by higher SG&A spending, reflecting investments in our new China headquarters facility and DTC operations.\r\nOne of our key objectives in resetting the China market is to increase the productivity and profitability of our retail spaces. As Trevor mentioned, comp sales for our DTC stores grew 11% in Q3 and, equally important, margins expanded significantly. Comp store sales for partner-operated NIKE stores that we've reset with more focused assortments also continued to grow at a double-digit pace, well above the fleet average. \r\nWe're very encouraged by the Q3 results in China. That said, not all of our financial metrics in China will improve in a linear fashion, as we optimize the flow of product into the market. As a result of planned changes in our seasonal product flow, futures are down 3% on a currency-neutral basis, and we anticipate Q4 revenue will be flat to slightly down.\r\nOur business in Japan continued to generate positive momentum, with 10% currency-neutral revenue growth, driven by higher revenues in nearly every key category. On a reported basis, Japan revenue declined 9% and EBIT fell 13%, reflecting the impact of the weaker yen, as well as increased SG&A spending behind the launch of nike.com in Japan.\r\nIn our emerging markets geography, currency-neutral revenues grew 19%, reflecting broad-based growth across virtually every business unit. Revenues for nearly every category increased double digits, led by Running, Football and Sportswear. And almost every territory in the geography also reported double-digit revenue growth, led by Brazil, Mexico and our Soco territory, which includes Argentina, Uruguay and Chile.\r\nOn a reported basis, revenue in the emerging markets grew 8% and EBIT increased 6%, reflecting the significant adverse impact of currency devaluations, as well as higher SG&A spending on infrastructure and DTC.\r\nFor the Converse brand, Q3 revenue grew 16% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis, driven by continued strength in direct distribution markets, particularly the United States, China and the U.K. The Chuck Taylor franchise continues to deliver sustained, profitable growth, and we're making progress extending the Converse brand in footwear and apparel. We're also developing the marketplace for the Converse brand by enhancing presentation in wholesale accounts, expanding DTC and transitioning new countries to direct distribution. So far this year, we've converted Scandinavia and Taiwan to direct distribution, and we're preparing for additional conversions in FY '15, laying the foundation for continued strong growth.\r\nOn a reported basis, EBIT increased 10% as higher revenue and gross margins were partially offset by increased SG&A investments in demand creation, infrastructure and DTC.\r\nThe NIKE Inc. portfolio has delivered strong performance year-to-date, and we expect to see continued momentum in our business as we finish the fiscal year. However, as I mentioned earlier, FX headwinds have been a significant drag on EPS growth so far this year, and we expect to face ongoing pressure in Q4 and into next year. Our guidance for Q4 and FY '15 incorporates the expected impact of these headwinds.\r\nWe now expect Q4 revenue to grow at a high single-digit rate. This is below the rate of futures growth, largely due to the timing of shipments at the beginning and end of Q4, as well as lower levels of at-once and closeout sales. For the full year, we now expect revenue growth at the top end of our high single-digit target range. We now expect gross margin for Q4 to expand by 50 to 75 basis points, somewhat better than our prior expectations due to a shift in mix to higher-margin products and geographies, as well as ongoing strength in our higher-margin DTC business.\r\nFor the full year, we expect gross margin expansion of about 90 basis points. For Q4, we now expect SG&A to grow at a high-teens rate. As I stated previously, we rephased a portion of our demand creation from Q3 to Q4, strengthening our World Cup marketing initiatives. Given that shift and a relatively lower level of spend in the fourth quarter of FY '13, we expect Q4 demand creation growth of over 30%.\r\nWe expect Q4 operating overhead to grow at a low double-digit rate, reflecting ongoing investments in strategic initiatives, such as digital and DTC. For the full year, we continue to expect SG&A to grow at a low-teens rate. For FY '14, we now expect the effective tax rate will be around 24%.\r\nWe haven't yet completed our planning for FY '15 but can provide some initial thoughts. We expect to see continued strong momentum in our business and anticipate currency-neutral revenue growth for FY '15 at or slightly above our high single-digit target range. That said, this year's devaluation of developing market currencies will be a significant drag on next year's reported revenue, gross margin and profit growth. In addition, we remain committed to investing in the strategies that are driving our growth. As a result, we expect FY '15 EPS growth will be somewhat below our mid-teens target range.\r\nAs Mark said at the top of the call, we feel great about the strong results we've delivered through the first 3 quarters of this fiscal year. As we look ahead to Q4 and FY '15, we'll continue to make strategic investments to drive sustainable, long-term growth while capitalizing on those investments we've already made to deliver consistent profitability and cash returns to our shareholders.\r\nWe're now ready to take your questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "My first question is on China. One of your biggest distributors had reported that they're regaining a reasonable profit margin by lowering the cost of purchases and there's new consideration for their performance on new metrics. And I wondered if you could help me understand how this may impact NIKE's profit margins in China, if at all.\n\n---\n\nWell, first of all, we've seen, as I said earlier, some improving performance in our retail stores and also, our wholesale partners are doing better. And I think when we get more productive and profitable in those retail spaces, that raises profitability for everybody. So our objective here is to make sure that the marketplace is as compelling for the consumers as possible and that we are generating productivity and profitability at the retail space. And we're confident that when we do that, both we and our retailers will be making more money.\n\n---\n\nAnd then my second question is on Basketball. If you could walk us through how you're thinking about managing the launch product as the Basketball category grows globally and why you think there seems to be more of an acceptance of basketball in Europe now versus other periods of time.\n\n---\n\nYes. It's a great question. Basketball clearly is continuing to become much more of a global sport. I think the fact that more people have a chance to see this sport all around the world. Obviously, they watch the NBA with the great players that we have from Kobe and LeBron, KD, I think people have the chance to really experience how those players are just keeping the excitement in the marketplace. In terms of how we continue to manage the launch, we manage everything pretty much from a global perspective. We will sometimes put in very specific products in some local markets like in China, which we will launch some specials in China. But across the board, we tend to run the -- our offense globally. In terms of in the future, we continue to feel that the consumers are becoming increasingly excited about the sport, and we look at Basketball as a -- just a tremendous growth opportunity. And all the work that we're doing with Foot Locker at the House of Hoops, the work that we're doing in our DTC stores are really helping to solidify the marketplace.\n\n---\n\nI would also add that the technology and the style that we're bringing to Basketball, both in NIKE and Jordan, are really resonating with consumers around the world. So we're just seeing an uptick in popularity of the category for all the reasons that Trevor had mentioned, but also I think from a design and innovation standpoint.\n\n---\n\nI'd love to hear an update on 2 of the topics you guys talked about at the Investor Day last year: price and premiumization. On price, how are using kind of price strategically relative to the cost inflation? I remember you talked about some new systems and processes to think about how to optimize pricing. And then on the premiumization question, could you elaborate or, if you're willing to, give some numbers around how the mix is shifting to more premium products? It seems the consumer is increasingly willing to pay more for better products. And then what does that mean for your lower-end offerings?\n\n---\n\nYes, on the pricing strategy, I think we talked about this once before where we continue to say that our pricing strategy really centers on ensuring that we have the right price value relationship with the consumer. One of the things that our focus on innovation really does is it gives us great credence, as we bring more products into the marketplace and have new innovations. You also have the strength of our brand, which allows us to command a premium price. And so we continue to drive the business from that perspective. The third zone that we continue to do is we continue to really look at pricing within the context of a particular marketplace and make sure that we're managing based on the market dynamics. What we are seeing is an increasing move towards premium products. A lot of our consumers are seeing our premium lines, and they're being very excited about them. So certainly, what we're seeing in the Sportswear Tech Pack, in our Sportswear lines, what we're seeing in our performance lines is the same thing. So we've really seen limited resistance to us continue to bring premium into the marketplace. But it's really based on given giving that consumer a clear value.\n\n---\n\nI think there's also an opportunity to actually take that premium product and that position, and that style, and that innovation down in the product line as well, to create what we like to all our complete offense. So we are setting the tone, I think, at the top. We're not seeing any resistance at all from consumers. I think the product is really resonating, and I think we can continue to do a better job of actually leveraging some of that style and innovation down throughout the whole product line.\n\n---\n\nJust the first question that I have is for Don. On the foreign exchange losses, how should we model that sort of in Q4 and in FY '15, knowing what you know today from your hedge position?\n\n---\n\nWell, first of all, one thing to bear in mind is there's 3 things that drive the FX impact on the company. One of them is gross margin. As you know, we sell product in many currencies around the world. We buy product in a variety of currencies now, probably about 2/3, U.S. dollar; about 1/3, other currencies, at this point. But that's one area of FX exposure. And we did have headwinds in Q3. We actually think the headwinds in Q4 are a little stronger. But at this stage, we've been doing a really good job, I think, of putting, as Trevor said earlier, premium products in the marketplace, taking price on a surgical basis. So we think we can continue to expand margins, but the headwinds are actually getting a little stronger in Q4. The second impact is on translation of profitability. And at this stage, we are, even if we stay where we are today on exchange rates, we're going to have a built-in devaluation versus where we were for the fourth quarter last year. So there'll be ongoing pressure for translation, and that will continue until we anniversary the major devaluations. So for most of FY '15, we'll see that headwind as well. And then the third piece has to do with translation of balance sheet items in various countries around the world. And certainly, the Argentine peso and the ruble were fairly significant drags from that this year. I think that as long as the currencies stay roughly where they are, that one should over time ease off. But at this stage, it's hard to tell. But I guess what I would step back from the whole question of currency and go back to one of Mark's comments, which is when you operate in 190 countries, the sort of volatility is something that goes with the territory. We have a large number of levers in our business to manage that helps us offset the pieces of the equation we can't manage. And I think our track record of delivering consistent growth, even in periods of time where we've got macroeconomic headwinds, tells you that we can continue to do that.\n\n---\n\nAnd then my second question is on the Basketball category, how many teams does NIKE have this year in March Madness versus last year? And who do you guys project to be the winner?\n\n---\n\nOh, well, I'll take the last part of that question first. Your guess is as good as mine. No, no, I'd say that in -- respectfully. But I think we have around 40 -- 49 teams out of the 68 teams. And so we're obviously -- that continues to shift as the tournament goes on. But clearly, the great thing about March Madness and those moments is that they provide an incredible platform to create excitement in the marketplace and drive demand. And so, to the earlier question, actually, those are some of the things that I think that continue to create excitement and allow us to continue to leverage our opportunity. And we're seeing those things continue to go global. So yes, we'll -- I hate to try and bet on exactly who wins. But as I always say, the more hope, the more business. So we'll take it from that perspective.\n\n---\n\nAnd I think Warren Buffet's $1 billion are probably safe. I don't know if anybody's going to get the brackets exactly right.\n\n---\n\nI think a question, maybe this is for Trevor. I was hoping you could maybe talk about NIKE's youth business. You call out Women's on the call but maybe how the youth business is doing, particularly in apparel relative to Women's and maybe Men's and maybe particularly in North America. And then my second smaller question was, I apologize if I missed it, but I know that you mentioned Russia did well. But is there any change to the outlook for Russia? And maybe, Don, remind us percent of sales Russia is for NIKE.\n\n---\n\nYes. First on -- just on young athletes, our young athletes business actually is doing incredibly well. We're just seeing an increase of consumers and certainly, working with our retail partners, have just clear access to young athletes products. Part of that strategy also comes very much in line with what we're seeing around our Basketball category and our performance categories, where the consumers are sort of buying similar products. So we're seeing an incredible growth really coming from the same sort of statement items that we've created in the adult category. So our ability to leverage those great, great items makes a difference. Also, in the United States, we're also working specifically around -- with the Kids Foot Locker around the Nike Fly Zone, where we're able to bring new concepts into the marketplace that give the consumers more access. And then the third zone would be our dot-com business. We're seeing a continued growth of consumers coming to dot-com and looking for young athlete products. So all in all, it's been a very strong quarter. But going forward, we're very bullish about the young athletes business because it just continues to grow, not only in North America, but really around the world.\n\n---\n\nAnd with respect to Russia, Robbie, I mean, right now, we have not yet seen any impact to our business. Obviously, we're hoping that, that solution -- that a resolution comes to that situation peacefully. And right now, we're focused on the things we can control, which is making sure we connect with our consumers and make sure we provide them with innovative products. I think in terms of that business for us, it's less than 25% of our CEE business. So at this stage, we think that whatever happens there, we'll obviously be able to manage it across our portfolio.\n\n---\n\nI just had a couple of quick ones. Number one -- just to clarify on your guidance, number one, can you tell us whether your operating margin -- your gross margin contemplates -- sorry, your earnings guidance contemplates gross margin expansion? And Don, thanks for the clarification on EPS impact from currency. How much of that is embedded into the FY '15 preliminary view?\n\n---\n\nI'm sorry. So the first question was -- I'm sorry, can you repeat the question, I...?\n\n---\n\nDid your guidance for next year contemplates gross margin improvement? And how much is -- what is the EPS drag for ForEx?\n\n---\n\nOkay. So with respect to broad outline, we're really at this stage -- at the preliminary stages. We would expect to see, over time, expansion of gross margin. How much of it obviously depends upon a lot of variables, many of which are not settled yet, including FX. So at this stage, I'm not ready to tell you a number of points that I think FX would be. What I can tell you is that when we look at the devaluation we saw in FY '14 and the fact that you have to anniversary that in FY '15, it will be a drag. The question of how much is going to depend upon where the numbers actually fall out by geography, by territory and where the currency exchange rates go.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Then maybe just as a follow-up on the gross margin side, is there anything specific on your supply chain initiatives, manufacturing revolution that you can call out as a meaningful driver to your P&L for next year?\n\n---\n\nYes, I wouldn't want to get into that level of granularity just yet. What I would say is just to go back to the conversations we had at the Analyst Day and what we've talked about on our last few calls. We do believe that this is -- a manufacturing revolution is going to be both impactful from a consumer standpoint in terms of the products and innovations we deliver to the market and how responsive we are, as well as the cost. At this point, I'm not ready to talk about an impact for FY '15.\n\n---\n\nClearly it's a terrific -- great execution across the global business. I'm sure it's frustrating to not see the full impact of that flow-through to reported earnings. A couple of questions. The currency volatility and recent devaluation of some of these currencies, how does that change strategy for capital allocation at all?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think it depends on your outlook for where you think the economy is going. I mean, certainly, as we talked about earlier, we manage these individual businesses. We're looking at the consumer value equation, so we're focused on the inflation in a particular market. We obviously are looking at our deployments of demand creation and so on. But in general terms, if we believe that the market over the long haul is going to be healthy, and most of these markets we believe will and we're going to see expansion of the middle class, we're going to be continuing to build our business and connect with consumers and deliver innovative product. Certainly, from a financial management standpoint, we're going to try to minimize the amount of cash we leave in those markets. We're going to minimize the level of receivables and so on. So financial management absolutely is driven by where we see the currency is going. From a business standpoint, sometimes these difficult times in emerging markets are opportunities for us to gain ground. I mean, the last time Argentina went through a financial issue, a number of years ago, we actually remained committed to that market. We built our business and we took a lot of market share.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Makes sense. Second question, there's been a lot of discussion in the investment community around how World Cup orders benefit the futures. Clearly, you've sponsored some of the important European and Latin American teams. Is it possible to put some shape around the impact of World Cup orders to the futures? How much of the growth that we're seeing today is from sponsorships, things like the kits, et cetera?\n\n---\n\nWell, there certainly is an impact. But what I would direct you to is the conversation we had about where the growth and revenue is coming from, as well as the growth in futures. We're seeing growth across categories around the world. So Running's up, Women's Training is up. We're seeing great results, as Trevor said earlier, from Basketball. So certainly, Global Football is a major driver here as it always is for this sort of event. But we're seeing growth very broadly across categories.\n\n---\n\nYes. And I would just say that we feel obviously great about our Football business and the potential as we head into the World Cup. Futures are up double digits. Revenue is up double digits. We're launching a great array of products into the marketplace, so we're super excited about the opportunity that the World Cup represents, but not only in markets like Brazil or just the emerging markets, but really all around the world. It's a tremendous platform for us to continue to grow the business.\n\n---\n\nOperator, we have time for one more question.\n\n---\n\nIt's Dave Weiner from Deutsche Bank. So I wanted to ask a question about China, if I could, and specifically, kind of a 2-parter. So one, it looks from what we can tell that the kind of macro environment for apparel and -- athletic apparel and footwear specifically is improving. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the overall marketplace. And then secondly, I think you made a comment that your own stores that have been reset saw a significant margin improvement. Could you just drill down a little bit on that? Is that based on gross margin and kind of the mix of product that you're selling, maybe the premiumization thesis or something else?\n\n---\n\nYes. On China, I think the part that we clearly can see is that the reset strategy that we put in place is working, and we're obviously very encouraged by the results that we're seeing in the marketplace. As I think Don sort of pointed to, we're very focused on driving both profitability and productivity at retail. What we've been able to do in our own stores is to continue to drive a premium position in the marketplace that is based on performance and then amplified to our Sportswear lines. And that combination is driving a better mix in the stores and it's leading to a much more profitable business. We're also -- across the marketplace, we're narrowing the amount of categories that we focus on, which is allowing us to go deeper to make sure that we have the right size curves in the marketplace. So the team is working very specifically down to the granular details to really help us build a better foundation for long-term growth in the marketplace by making sure that we're driving against the right operational metrics but also delivering against the consumers, specifically around what the customer wants in China.\n\n---\n\nYes, it's really a case of focusing on the fundamentals, executing the merchandising, the product flow, the assortment planning and then the storytelling at retail. Some of the retail executions in those reset doors that we have in China, I would say, are some of the best we have in the world. And then the response from the consumer is obviously quite positive. The Chinese consumer, I'll just say as a general point, is more and more sophisticated and discriminating in terms of their choice in product. And price is not a limiting factor in the end, if the product and the brand are really resonating. And we're definitely seeing that in China as we are in other parts of the world.\n\n---\n\nDo you have time for me to squeeze maybe one more in? A quick one?\n\n---\n\nSure.\n\n---\n\nSo someone asked earlier about kind of the payback schedule for some of your initiatives, 3D printing, Flyknit and kind of your other supply chain and manufacturing efficiencies, and I understand you don't want to talk about next year. But can you at least comment if, from the investment side, if you've -- already kind of well on your way to kind of starting to apply the -- some of these initiatives broadly so that, at least from an investment point of view, you've already started that to some degree?\n\n---\n\nYes. I'll jump in and say that the -- there's 2 factors that are really driving a lot of our priorities in this manufacturing revolution space. One is to create the capability to create new innovation and product that the consumers can experience. Flyknit is a great example of a process -- and 3D printing, as you mentioned, processes that allow us to do things that conventional shoemaking or a product manufacturing process won't allow us to do. So there's breakthroughs in performance innovation that come. We're also very discriminating when it comes to making sure that we're focused on things that can really affect the bottom line, the product cost. So we are prioritizing our investments. And this is a great example of we have lots of opportunities and we need to make choices, but we're making choices against things that can help us innovate the product, as well as actually reduce our product cost and our speed to market. So we actually have a very strong and deep view over the next 3- to 5-year period and that's expanding on the impact that these investments are making. And again, we're prioritizing where we think we can have the greatest impact. It's one of the areas, frankly, as an innovation geek, I'm most excited about.\n\n---\n\nYes. From an investment standpoint, I just wanted to make the point that I think to the conversation that we just had from Mark, there's a lot more opportunity and we're not even close to the end of this. And what I'd also point out is that a lot of this investment will be made in partnership with our factory group. So you won't see all of this investment on our books. In fact, in many cases, the factory partners are going to make most of this investment. We're really the drivers of the innovation, the catalyst for this. So we're -- we've got a long list of opportunities ahead of us.\n\n---\n\nWell, thank you, everyone, for joining us this quarter, and we will talk to you next time. Bye.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Kate McShane (Analysts)】\nMy first question is on China. One of your biggest distributors had reported that they're regaining a reasonable profit margin by lowering the cost of purchases and there's new consideration for their performance on new metrics. And I wondered if you could help me understand how this may impact NIKE's profit margins in China, if at all.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nWell, first of all, we've seen, as I said earlier, some improving performance in our retail stores and also, our wholesale partners are doing better. And I think when we get more productive and profitable in those retail spaces, that raises profitability for everybody. So our objective here is to make sure that the marketplace is as compelling for the consumers as possible and that we are generating productivity and profitability at the retail space. And we're confident that when we do that, both we and our retailers will be making more money.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kate McShane (Analysts)】\nAnd then my second question is on Basketball. If you could walk us through how you're thinking about managing the launch product as the Basketball category grows globally and why you think there seems to be more of an acceptance of basketball in Europe now versus other periods of time.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nYes. It's a great question. Basketball clearly is continuing to become much more of a global sport. I think the fact that more people have a chance to see this sport all around the world. Obviously, they watch the NBA with the great players that we have from Kobe and LeBron, KD, I think people have the chance to really experience how those players are just keeping the excitement in the marketplace. In terms of how we continue to manage the launch, we manage everything pretty much from a global perspective. We will sometimes put in very specific products in some local markets like in China, which we will launch some specials in China. But across the board, we tend to run the -- our offense globally. In terms of in the future, we continue to feel that the consumers are becoming increasingly excited about the sport, and we look at Basketball as a -- just a tremendous growth opportunity. And all the work that we're doing with Foot Locker at the House of Hoops, the work that we're doing in our DTC stores are really helping to solidify the marketplace.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nI would also add that the technology and the style that we're bringing to Basketball, both in NIKE and Jordan, are really resonating with consumers around the world. So we're just seeing an uptick in popularity of the category for all the reasons that Trevor had mentioned, but also I think from a design and innovation standpoint.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Omar Saad (Analysts)】\nI'd love to hear an update on 2 of the topics you guys talked about at the Investor Day last year: price and premiumization. On price, how are using kind of price strategically relative to the cost inflation? I remember you talked about some new systems and processes to think about how to optimize pricing. And then on the premiumization question, could you elaborate or, if you're willing to, give some numbers around how the mix is shifting to more premium products? It seems the consumer is increasingly willing to pay more for better products. And then what does that mean for your lower-end offerings?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nYes, on the pricing strategy, I think we talked about this once before where we continue to say that our pricing strategy really centers on ensuring that we have the right price value relationship with the consumer. One of the things that our focus on innovation really does is it gives us great credence, as we bring more products into the marketplace and have new innovations. You also have the strength of our brand, which allows us to command a premium price. And so we continue to drive the business from that perspective. The third zone that we continue to do is we continue to really look at pricing within the context of a particular marketplace and make sure that we're managing based on the market dynamics. What we are seeing is an increasing move towards premium products. A lot of our consumers are seeing our premium lines, and they're being very excited about them. So certainly, what we're seeing in the Sportswear Tech Pack, in our Sportswear lines, what we're seeing in our performance lines is the same thing. So we've really seen limited resistance to us continue to bring premium into the marketplace. But it's really based on given giving that consumer a clear value.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nI think there's also an opportunity to actually take that premium product and that position, and that style, and that innovation down in the product line as well, to create what we like to all our complete offense. So we are setting the tone, I think, at the top. We're not seeing any resistance at all from consumers. I think the product is really resonating, and I think we can continue to do a better job of actually leveraging some of that style and innovation down throughout the whole product line.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Drbul (Analysts)】\nJust the first question that I have is for Don. On the foreign exchange losses, how should we model that sort of in Q4 and in FY '15, knowing what you know today from your hedge position?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nWell, first of all, one thing to bear in mind is there's 3 things that drive the FX impact on the company. One of them is gross margin. As you know, we sell product in many currencies around the world. We buy product in a variety of currencies now, probably about 2/3, U.S. dollar; about 1/3, other currencies, at this point. But that's one area of FX exposure. And we did have headwinds in Q3. We actually think the headwinds in Q4 are a little stronger. But at this stage, we've been doing a really good job, I think, of putting, as Trevor said earlier, premium products in the marketplace, taking price on a surgical basis. So we think we can continue to expand margins, but the headwinds are actually getting a little stronger in Q4. The second impact is on translation of profitability. And at this stage, we are, even if we stay where we are today on exchange rates, we're going to have a built-in devaluation versus where we were for the fourth quarter last year. So there'll be ongoing pressure for translation, and that will continue until we anniversary the major devaluations. So for most of FY '15, we'll see that headwind as well. And then the third piece has to do with translation of balance sheet items in various countries around the world. And certainly, the Argentine peso and the ruble were fairly significant drags from that this year. I think that as long as the currencies stay roughly where they are, that one should over time ease off. But at this stage, it's hard to tell. But I guess what I would step back from the whole question of currency and go back to one of Mark's comments, which is when you operate in 190 countries, the sort of volatility is something that goes with the territory. We have a large number of levers in our business to manage that helps us offset the pieces of the equation we can't manage. And I think our track record of delivering consistent growth, even in periods of time where we've got macroeconomic headwinds, tells you that we can continue to do that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Drbul (Analysts)】\nAnd then my second question is on the Basketball category, how many teams does NIKE have this year in March Madness versus last year? And who do you guys project to be the winner?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nOh, well, I'll take the last part of that question first. Your guess is as good as mine. No, no, I'd say that in -- respectfully. But I think we have around 40 -- 49 teams out of the 68 teams. And so we're obviously -- that continues to shift as the tournament goes on. But clearly, the great thing about March Madness and those moments is that they provide an incredible platform to create excitement in the marketplace and drive demand. And so, to the earlier question, actually, those are some of the things that I think that continue to create excitement and allow us to continue to leverage our opportunity. And we're seeing those things continue to go global. So yes, we'll -- I hate to try and bet on exactly who wins. But as I always say, the more hope, the more business. So we'll take it from that perspective.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nAnd I think Warren Buffet's $1 billion are probably safe. I don't know if anybody's going to get the brackets exactly right.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nI think a question, maybe this is for Trevor. I was hoping you could maybe talk about NIKE's youth business. You call out Women's on the call but maybe how the youth business is doing, particularly in apparel relative to Women's and maybe Men's and maybe particularly in North America. And then my second smaller question was, I apologize if I missed it, but I know that you mentioned Russia did well. But is there any change to the outlook for Russia? And maybe, Don, remind us percent of sales Russia is for NIKE.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nYes. First on -- just on young athletes, our young athletes business actually is doing incredibly well. We're just seeing an increase of consumers and certainly, working with our retail partners, have just clear access to young athletes products. Part of that strategy also comes very much in line with what we're seeing around our Basketball category and our performance categories, where the consumers are sort of buying similar products. So we're seeing an incredible growth really coming from the same sort of statement items that we've created in the adult category. So our ability to leverage those great, great items makes a difference. Also, in the United States, we're also working specifically around -- with the Kids Foot Locker around the Nike Fly Zone, where we're able to bring new concepts into the marketplace that give the consumers more access. And then the third zone would be our dot-com business. We're seeing a continued growth of consumers coming to dot-com and looking for young athlete products. So all in all, it's been a very strong quarter. But going forward, we're very bullish about the young athletes business because it just continues to grow, not only in North America, but really around the world.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nAnd with respect to Russia, Robbie, I mean, right now, we have not yet seen any impact to our business. Obviously, we're hoping that, that solution -- that a resolution comes to that situation peacefully. And right now, we're focused on the things we can control, which is making sure we connect with our consumers and make sure we provide them with innovative products. I think in terms of that business for us, it's less than 25% of our CEE business. So at this stage, we think that whatever happens there, we'll obviously be able to manage it across our portfolio.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lindsay Mann (Analysts)】\nI just had a couple of quick ones. Number one -- just to clarify on your guidance, number one, can you tell us whether your operating margin -- your gross margin contemplates -- sorry, your earnings guidance contemplates gross margin expansion? And Don, thanks for the clarification on EPS impact from currency. How much of that is embedded into the FY '15 preliminary view?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nI'm sorry. So the first question was -- I'm sorry, can you repeat the question, I...?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lindsay Mann (Analysts)】\nDid your guidance for next year contemplates gross margin improvement? And how much is -- what is the EPS drag for ForEx?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nOkay. So with respect to broad outline, we're really at this stage -- at the preliminary stages. We would expect to see, over time, expansion of gross margin. How much of it obviously depends upon a lot of variables, many of which are not settled yet, including FX. So at this stage, I'm not ready to tell you a number of points that I think FX would be. What I can tell you is that when we look at the devaluation we saw in FY '14 and the fact that you have to anniversary that in FY '15, it will be a drag. The question of how much is going to depend upon where the numbers actually fall out by geography, by territory and where the currency exchange rates go.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lindsay Mann (Analysts)】\nOkay. Then maybe just as a follow-up on the gross margin side, is there anything specific on your supply chain initiatives, manufacturing revolution that you can call out as a meaningful driver to your P&L for next year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nYes, I wouldn't want to get into that level of granularity just yet. What I would say is just to go back to the conversations we had at the Analyst Day and what we've talked about on our last few calls. We do believe that this is -- a manufacturing revolution is going to be both impactful from a consumer standpoint in terms of the products and innovations we deliver to the market and how responsive we are, as well as the cost. At this point, I'm not ready to talk about an impact for FY '15.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jim Duffy (Analysts)】\nClearly it's a terrific -- great execution across the global business. I'm sure it's frustrating to not see the full impact of that flow-through to reported earnings. A couple of questions. The currency volatility and recent devaluation of some of these currencies, how does that change strategy for capital allocation at all?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nWell, I think it depends on your outlook for where you think the economy is going. I mean, certainly, as we talked about earlier, we manage these individual businesses. We're looking at the consumer value equation, so we're focused on the inflation in a particular market. We obviously are looking at our deployments of demand creation and so on. But in general terms, if we believe that the market over the long haul is going to be healthy, and most of these markets we believe will and we're going to see expansion of the middle class, we're going to be continuing to build our business and connect with consumers and deliver innovative product. Certainly, from a financial management standpoint, we're going to try to minimize the amount of cash we leave in those markets. We're going to minimize the level of receivables and so on. So financial management absolutely is driven by where we see the currency is going. From a business standpoint, sometimes these difficult times in emerging markets are opportunities for us to gain ground. I mean, the last time Argentina went through a financial issue, a number of years ago, we actually remained committed to that market. We built our business and we took a lot of market share.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jim Duffy (Analysts)】\nGreat. Makes sense. Second question, there's been a lot of discussion in the investment community around how World Cup orders benefit the futures. Clearly, you've sponsored some of the important European and Latin American teams. Is it possible to put some shape around the impact of World Cup orders to the futures? How much of the growth that we're seeing today is from sponsorships, things like the kits, et cetera?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nWell, there certainly is an impact. But what I would direct you to is the conversation we had about where the growth and revenue is coming from, as well as the growth in futures. We're seeing growth across categories around the world. So Running's up, Women's Training is up. We're seeing great results, as Trevor said earlier, from Basketball. So certainly, Global Football is a major driver here as it always is for this sort of event. But we're seeing growth very broadly across categories.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nYes. And I would just say that we feel obviously great about our Football business and the potential as we head into the World Cup. Futures are up double digits. Revenue is up double digits. We're launching a great array of products into the marketplace, so we're super excited about the opportunity that the World Cup represents, but not only in markets like Brazil or just the emerging markets, but really all around the world. It's a tremendous platform for us to continue to grow the business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nOperator, we have time for one more question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Weiner (Analysts)】\nIt's Dave Weiner from Deutsche Bank. So I wanted to ask a question about China, if I could, and specifically, kind of a 2-parter. So one, it looks from what we can tell that the kind of macro environment for apparel and -- athletic apparel and footwear specifically is improving. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the overall marketplace. And then secondly, I think you made a comment that your own stores that have been reset saw a significant margin improvement. Could you just drill down a little bit on that? Is that based on gross margin and kind of the mix of product that you're selling, maybe the premiumization thesis or something else?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nYes. On China, I think the part that we clearly can see is that the reset strategy that we put in place is working, and we're obviously very encouraged by the results that we're seeing in the marketplace. As I think Don sort of pointed to, we're very focused on driving both profitability and productivity at retail. What we've been able to do in our own stores is to continue to drive a premium position in the marketplace that is based on performance and then amplified to our Sportswear lines. And that combination is driving a better mix in the stores and it's leading to a much more profitable business. We're also -- across the marketplace, we're narrowing the amount of categories that we focus on, which is allowing us to go deeper to make sure that we have the right size curves in the marketplace. So the team is working very specifically down to the granular details to really help us build a better foundation for long-term growth in the marketplace by making sure that we're driving against the right operational metrics but also delivering against the consumers, specifically around what the customer wants in China.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nYes, it's really a case of focusing on the fundamentals, executing the merchandising, the product flow, the assortment planning and then the storytelling at retail. Some of the retail executions in those reset doors that we have in China, I would say, are some of the best we have in the world. And then the response from the consumer is obviously quite positive. The Chinese consumer, I'll just say as a general point, is more and more sophisticated and discriminating in terms of their choice in product. And price is not a limiting factor in the end, if the product and the brand are really resonating. And we're definitely seeing that in China as we are in other parts of the world.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Weiner (Analysts)】\nDo you have time for me to squeeze maybe one more in? A quick one?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nSure.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Weiner (Analysts)】\nSo someone asked earlier about kind of the payback schedule for some of your initiatives, 3D printing, Flyknit and kind of your other supply chain and manufacturing efficiencies, and I understand you don't want to talk about next year. But can you at least comment if, from the investment side, if you've -- already kind of well on your way to kind of starting to apply the -- some of these initiatives broadly so that, at least from an investment point of view, you've already started that to some degree?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nYes. I'll jump in and say that the -- there's 2 factors that are really driving a lot of our priorities in this manufacturing revolution space. One is to create the capability to create new innovation and product that the consumers can experience. Flyknit is a great example of a process -- and 3D printing, as you mentioned, processes that allow us to do things that conventional shoemaking or a product manufacturing process won't allow us to do. So there's breakthroughs in performance innovation that come. We're also very discriminating when it comes to making sure that we're focused on things that can really affect the bottom line, the product cost. So we are prioritizing our investments. And this is a great example of we have lots of opportunities and we need to make choices, but we're making choices against things that can help us innovate the product, as well as actually reduce our product cost and our speed to market. So we actually have a very strong and deep view over the next 3- to 5-year period and that's expanding on the impact that these investments are making. And again, we're prioritizing where we think we can have the greatest impact. It's one of the areas, frankly, as an innovation geek, I'm most excited about.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nYes. From an investment standpoint, I just wanted to make the point that I think to the conversation that we just had from Mark, there's a lot more opportunity and we're not even close to the end of this. And what I'd also point out is that a lot of this investment will be made in partnership with our factory group. So you won't see all of this investment on our books. In fact, in many cases, the factory partners are going to make most of this investment. We're really the drivers of the innovation, the catalyst for this. So we're -- we've got a long list of opportunities ahead of us.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nWell, thank you, everyone, for joining us this quarter, and we will talk to you next time.

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Kelly, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's third quarter fiscal year 2014 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. \r\nOn the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Larry Ellison; President and CFO, Safra Catz; and President, Mark Hurd. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. \r\nThroughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. And we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-Q and 10-K and any applicable amendment, for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. \r\nAnd finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. \r\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Safra.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3. I'll then review guidance for Q4 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. This quarter, currency was a 1% headwind to new software license and a 2% headwind to hardware and total revenue. In addition, EPS this year was reduced by $0.02 due to a currency remeasurement nonoperating loss for Venezuela that obviously had not been included in my guidance. In Q3 of last year, Venezuela's devaluation had a $0.01 impact. \r\nQ3 for us was a solid quarter, and overall, we're pleased with our results. Core businesses were within guidance and areas of investor focus, including cloud, Engineered Systems and hardware, all delivered strong results. \r\nMy comments today are generally going to reflect constant dollar growth rates, unless I mention it otherwise. Total software revenues were nearly $7 billion, up 6% from last year. Software updates and product support revenues drove nearly 1/2 the total company revenue at $4.6 billion, up 7% from last year. Q3 renewal rates were at a 4-year high, as our installed base of 400,000 customers continues to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenues were $2.4 billion, up 5%. \r\nLooking at GAAP results by region, the Americas grew 9%, with Latin America particularly strong, and EMEA grew 3%. Asia Pacific, though, declined, with Australia and India both down. Within software, cloud subscriptions were $292 million, up 24% from last year. As our cloud business continues to ramp, bookings growth was again much higher than cloud subscription revenue growth. \r\nWe've been using Fusion accounting for our own financial reporting for 2 years. And revenues for all portfolios of Fusion, including financial, supply chain, HCM and customer experience, grew triple digits. \r\nNow as our cloud business becomes more material, I want to share how cloud subscriptions affect our financials. Most obvious is that revenue is initially lower, as subscription license revenue is recognized over the life of the agreement as opposed to license revenue being taken upfront. Over time, since we are providing much more than just the software and the update, the revenue is higher. The additional value we are providing is the hardware, including our Engineered Systems, the hosting and the expertise that only Oracle can provide, while leveraging the economies of scale that we have. \r\nSo while customers are paying over time, they're using and paying for more Oracle products through cloud subscription. They are paying less in total because they too can benefit from our operating synergies. Net-net, the cloud operating business is attractive for both customers and for Oracle, but especially so given the integration of Oracle hardware, software and expertise.\r\nFor software, database continues to do very well, with Exadata, Exalytics and Business Intelligence software products all up more than 30%. Also strong was customer experience and/or CRM, both on-premise and SaaS, as well as our communications and project management verticals. The quarter was not dependent on any one large deal. \r\nHardware system product revenue was $725 million, up 10% from last year. Obviously, we're pleased to have exceeded our guidance, but it's also nice to report growth. Engineered Systems grew more than 30%, and this spectacular growth is reflected not only in our hardware growth, but also in the very long list of customer wins we had against IBM. Engineered Systems now account for nearly 1/3 of all hardware product sales. \r\nHardware gross margins are down about 2 points, because we are packing the newest systems with more memory without raising prices. Hardware support was $600 million, up 7% from last year, but down sequentially on normal -- our normal seasonal pattern. \r\nFor the company, total revenue for the quarter was $9.3 billion, up 6% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income grew $188 million to $4.4 billion, up 6% over last year. And the operating margin was 47%, again. \r\nWe believe we can invest for growth and make money, as we continue to see leverage in our business model. As I mentioned earlier, included in our nonoperating expense is a foreign currency remeasurement loss of $110 million related to our Venezuelan subsidiary. Were it not for this loss, EPS would have been $0.02 higher. \r\nThe non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 23%. The non-GAAP EPS was USD 0.68, growing 7% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 21%, and GAAP EPS for the quarter was USD 0.56, up 10% in constant currency. \r\nFree cash flow increased 11% to $14.4 billion over the last 4 quarters. We now have more than $37 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $13 billion. As we've said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through earnings growth, stock repurchases and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 55.4 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased nearly 360 [ph] million shares, for a total of $10.7 billion and reducing -- and reduced our share count by 5%. \r\nWe've also paid out more than $1.6 billion in dividends this fiscal year so far. Stock repurchases and dividends have totaled more than 85% of free cash flow over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share. \r\nNow to the guidance. And if currency were to stay where it is today, then the impact of currency would be minimal. Of course, this could change quickly. New software license and cloud subscription revenue growth is expected to range from 0% to 10%. Hardware product revenue growth is expected to range from 0% to 10%. As a result, total revenue growth on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 3% to 7% in recorded dollars. \r\nNon-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.92 and $0.99 in constant dollars and in reported dollars. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.79 to $0.86. Now I want to remind you that last year we recognized an acquisition-related benefit of $269 million in connection with the Pillar Data Systems earnout. \r\nExcluding that benefit, GAAP EPS last Q4 would have been $0.74. This guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%. And of course, it may end up being different. Finally, my guidance does not take into account any additional nonoperating remeasurement losses as a result of exchange rate changes in Venezuela. \r\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Safra. Oracle's Engineered Systems, including Exadata and SPARC SuperClusters, achieved a 30% constant currency growth rate in the quarter, while throughout the industry, traditional high-end server product lines are in steep decline. \r\nOur Engineered Systems business is growing rapidly for the same fundamental reason that our cloud applications business is growing rapidly. In both cases, customers want us to integrate the hardware and software and make it work together so they don't have to. \r\nAs customers shift from -- to pre-integrated hardware and cloud computing in search of lower cost and more rapid implementations, Oracle is presented with new opportunities for leadership in a number of market categories. \r\nFive years ago, we delivered our first Exadata machine. In the next few months, we will deliver our 10,000th Engineered System. We believe Oracle's Engineered Systems are well on their way to replacing IBM pSeries as the leader in high-end computing.\r\nEight years ago, we started to rewrite all of our applications for the cloud. Now those, Fusion ERP, HCM and CRM cloud applications are competing effectively with SaaS product specialists like Salesforce and Workday. SAP has not yet begun to rewrite their ERP, HCM and CRM applications for the cloud. This gives us the opportunity to become the leader in cloud applications and replace SAP as the leader in the overall applications marketplace.\r\nStrong sales of our cloud applications, Engineered Systems and 12c database demonstrate that Oracle is successfully exploiting the transition to the new generation of cloud computing and big data. Mark?\n\n---\n\nSure. Just a couple of comments. Solid results for us in Europe and North America. Latin America was very strong for us, while Asia Pac was mixed. Japan had a solid quarter. \r\nIn cloud, this was our best quarter ever. Excellent bookings growth, more than 60%. The booking growth more than doubled the revenue growth, as we're just winning in the cloud across all portfolios. Contract sizes are growing. More than 65 7- or 8-figure deals, with many driven by Fusion HCM and sales cloud. We're seeing good growth from acquired cloud offerings and Fusion cloud growth was even better, with HCM, sales force automation, and ERP all up triple digits. \r\nIn HCM, we added 250 customers or roughly 4x to 5x the number reported by Workday. We're seeing excellent growth across all solutions, core HR, payroll and Talent Cloud, double-digit growth in Taleo and triple-digit growth in Fusion HCM. In ERP, triple-digit growth with a bigger customer base than Workday. And we're growing faster, period. \r\nIn customer experience, we added more than 260 new customers with strong growth across all our solutions: marketing, sales, service and social clouds. Our 60%-plus cloud booking growth is considerably higher than salesforce.com. \r\nOur Fusion products are now in release 8, with 1,000 new features in that release, with improvements. Coming with release 9 again this summer will be a similar number of new features. So release 8, 1,000 new features, release 9 this summer with roughly the same number of features. Along with responses in BlueKai soon, we continue to gain momentum on the product side, the customer side, and you will see this in our financial performance. \r\nAt hardware, 10% overall growth. We grew in every single region. We're growing while our competitors are declining. We're taking share and we created a new category in high-end computing, Engineered Systems. As Larry mentioned, soon, we will have sold more than 10,000 Engineered Systems, and our 32% growth rate this quarter is against a meaningful comparison. In fact, Q3 last year was the all-time record, at that time, for systems sold. \r\nAll major Engineered Systems products grew double-digits, SPARC SuperCluster saw triple-digit growth again this quarter. Both the T server and NAS storage saw good growth, and combined with Engineered Systems, these products now make up nearly 2/3 of all product revenue and grow roughly 20%. \r\nDatabase continues to show strong performance and we've not yet begun to see the coming benefits of 12c, which will help drive license growth. Middleware was very strong as well, with double-digit growth, led by excellent performance in data analytics. Cloud and Engineered Systems are 2 hypergrowth businesses inside the largest cash flow company, enterprise technology. \r\nAnd with that, we'll take whatever questions you've got.\n\n---\n\nKelly? Can they, please?",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Ken Bond (Executives)】\nThank you, Kelly, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's third quarter fiscal year 2014 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. \r\nOn the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Larry Ellison; President and CFO, Safra Catz; and President, Mark Hurd. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. \r\nThroughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. And we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-Q and 10-K and any applicable amendment, for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. \r\nAnd finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. \r\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Safra.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nThanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3. I'll then review guidance for Q4 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. This quarter, currency was a 1% headwind to new software license and a 2% headwind to hardware and total revenue. In addition, EPS this year was reduced by $0.02 due to a currency remeasurement nonoperating loss for Venezuela that obviously had not been included in my guidance. In Q3 of last year, Venezuela's devaluation had a $0.01 impact. \r\nQ3 for us was a solid quarter, and overall, we're pleased with our results. Core businesses were within guidance and areas of investor focus, including cloud, Engineered Systems and hardware, all delivered strong results. \r\nMy comments today are generally going to reflect constant dollar growth rates, unless I mention it otherwise. Total software revenues were nearly $7 billion, up 6% from last year. Software updates and product support revenues drove nearly 1/2 the total company revenue at $4.6 billion, up 7% from last year. Q3 renewal rates were at a 4-year high, as our installed base of 400,000 customers continues to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenues were $2.4 billion, up 5%. \r\nLooking at GAAP results by region, the Americas grew 9%, with Latin America particularly strong, and EMEA grew 3%. Asia Pacific, though, declined, with Australia and India both down. Within software, cloud subscriptions were $292 million, up 24% from last year. As our cloud business continues to ramp, bookings growth was again much higher than cloud subscription revenue growth. \r\nWe've been using Fusion accounting for our own financial reporting for 2 years. And revenues for all portfolios of Fusion, including financial, supply chain, HCM and customer experience, grew triple digits. \r\nNow as our cloud business becomes more material, I want to share how cloud subscriptions affect our financials. Most obvious is that revenue is initially lower, as subscription license revenue is recognized over the life of the agreement as opposed to license revenue being taken upfront. Over time, since we are providing much more than just the software and the update, the revenue is higher. The additional value we are providing is the hardware, including our Engineered Systems, the hosting and the expertise that only Oracle can provide, while leveraging the economies of scale that we have. \r\nSo while customers are paying over time, they're using and paying for more Oracle products through cloud subscription. They are paying less in total because they too can benefit from our operating synergies. Net-net, the cloud operating business is attractive for both customers and for Oracle, but especially so given the integration of Oracle hardware, software and expertise.\r\nFor software, database continues to do very well, with Exadata, Exalytics and Business Intelligence software products all up more than 30%. Also strong was customer experience and/or CRM, both on-premise and SaaS, as well as our communications and project management verticals. The quarter was not dependent on any one large deal. \r\nHardware system product revenue was $725 million, up 10% from last year. Obviously, we're pleased to have exceeded our guidance, but it's also nice to report growth. Engineered Systems grew more than 30%, and this spectacular growth is reflected not only in our hardware growth, but also in the very long list of customer wins we had against IBM. Engineered Systems now account for nearly 1/3 of all hardware product sales. \r\nHardware gross margins are down about 2 points, because we are packing the newest systems with more memory without raising prices. Hardware support was $600 million, up 7% from last year, but down sequentially on normal -- our normal seasonal pattern. \r\nFor the company, total revenue for the quarter was $9.3 billion, up 6% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income grew $188 million to $4.4 billion, up 6% over last year. And the operating margin was 47%, again. \r\nWe believe we can invest for growth and make money, as we continue to see leverage in our business model. As I mentioned earlier, included in our nonoperating expense is a foreign currency remeasurement loss of $110 million related to our Venezuelan subsidiary. Were it not for this loss, EPS would have been $0.02 higher. \r\nThe non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 23%. The non-GAAP EPS was USD 0.68, growing 7% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 21%, and GAAP EPS for the quarter was USD 0.56, up 10% in constant currency. \r\nFree cash flow increased 11% to $14.4 billion over the last 4 quarters. We now have more than $37 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $13 billion. As we've said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through earnings growth, stock repurchases and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 55.4 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased nearly 360 [ph] million shares, for a total of $10.7 billion and reducing -- and reduced our share count by 5%. \r\nWe've also paid out more than $1.6 billion in dividends this fiscal year so far. Stock repurchases and dividends have totaled more than 85% of free cash flow over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share. \r\nNow to the guidance. And if currency were to stay where it is today, then the impact of currency would be minimal. Of course, this could change quickly. New software license and cloud subscription revenue growth is expected to range from 0% to 10%. Hardware product revenue growth is expected to range from 0% to 10%. As a result, total revenue growth on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 3% to 7% in recorded dollars. \r\nNon-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.92 and $0.99 in constant dollars and in reported dollars. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.79 to $0.86. Now I want to remind you that last year we recognized an acquisition-related benefit of $269 million in connection with the Pillar Data Systems earnout. \r\nExcluding that benefit, GAAP EPS last Q4 would have been $0.74. This guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%. And of course, it may end up being different. Finally, my guidance does not take into account any additional nonoperating remeasurement losses as a result of exchange rate changes in Venezuela. \r\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nThank you, Safra.

Can they, please?",
      "transcript_text3": "My question is for Mark. I guess the stronger momentum in Oracle's cloud software bookings and revenue growth really jumped out at me among the data points in the release. I know you gave some good color by product. Wondering if you might add a little bit more depth to help us understand what the broader drivers were. Was it Oracle doing a better job cross-selling on acquisitions? Was it the better functionality in Fusion version 7? Maybe any other factors that you think are worth highlighting.\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean -- and the good news I'd tell you is that we're just better at almost every part of this. I mean, I really don't know how much, how -- I think we felt we knew a lot a year ago or a couple of years ago. We just know a lot more now. We're better at -- we're better from a product perspective. I talked to you a little bit about what we've got in release 8. I mean, its 1,000 new features across the entire release. So big, big jump from a product perspective. We obviously have more feet on the street than we had. And certainly not just more feet on the street, but they've been in place longer. They've been now trained multiple times. And clearly, the perception in the market now has improved a better cloud position. I think last quarter, our 35% growth was good news, and clearly, this 60% growth is even better news. So I think that will help us as well. But it is broad based, Karl. So there's no one deal in here. There's no one product line that drove it. It's really across all of our product lines. As I mentioned, our Fusion products, our organic Fusion products, really had a fantastic quarter. Fusion HCM, Fusion sales automation and Fusion ERP, all 3, very strong. And it's really true across most regions as well. I don't have a region story that would be unique to the growth rate. It was fairly consistent across all regions. So I hope that's helpful.\n\n---\n\nThe other area that stood out this quarter was hardware. And it fits -- it's a bit puzzling, because like if I look at the IBM numbers, they are declining quite significantly. You mentioned some of the drivers there already. Can you just kind of go a little bit deeper in there and also kind of how you see that kind of -- we've been waiting for a turnaround in hardware for a while? Now all the things that you're talking are coming through. Is that kind of something sustainable? And how do you see that playing out against the competition going forward?\n\n---\n\nIt's absolutely sustainable because Engineered Systems has been growing rapidly for a long time. We keep talking about it. Now the problem has -- a couple of years ago, was Engineered Systems was a small percentage of the total. Now Engineered Systems has grown up to be over 30% of the total. So there's very -- and soon, it's going to be 1/2 of the total. So that's very, very positive. The x86 commodity business, which used to be a big business when we bought Sun, has now shrunk to almost nothing. So our hardware business has gone through the transition where we've gotten out of the commodity storage business, we've gotten out of the commodity server business and replaced it with computing systems with a lot of our own intellectual property. There -- these businesses are growing rapidly and have very good margins. The reason we compete with IBM pSeries all the time head-to-head. And it's not uncommon for our systems to go -- to be several times faster than IBM. Let me give you one example, without saying who the competitor was. We replaced a system at -- in the world's largest cloud company. You guys can figure out who that is, world's largest cloud company. We delivered an Exadata system to them. They moved their application and got it live in 3 weeks and experienced 10x better performance at a fraction of the cost. This is not uncommon, when we install an Exadata machine or a SPARC SuperCluster, to have a very rapid implementation, deliver terrific performance at a dramatically lower overall cost because all of the complexity of integration is done by us, not by them.\n\n---\n\nI'd add to your comment, you asked if it was sustainable. What I'd hope you'd be encouraged by was if you looked at our performance over the past several quarters, you've seen the reflection of our execution of our strategy in hardware support. You've seen hardware support continued to incline year-over-year and sequentially in terms of its performance. We grew now at 7% in Q3, which is a reflection of what Larry described. The fact that there is higher Oracle IP directly relates to our attach rates and eventually what turns into hardware support. So we now have our core businesses that have all been refreshed, and that's why I mentioned it. Our T-Systems, our Network Attached Storage or ZFS storage and our Engineered Systems are now almost 70% of our revenue. And all 3 of those are growing. And they are gaining share. So it's sustainable. I -- listen, I can't predict the macro, but I can predict we will continue to gain share. And to add to Larry's point, we just don't compete with the server vendors, we actually do a lot of other things than just compete with an IBM. I mean, we compete with EMC, frankly, when we get into those environments, because we radically change our customer's storage requirements. If our customers got a petabyte of storage, we can -- we know how to compress that data, with Exadata, to where they may only need to use 100 terabytes. And so this opportunity for us to now change the game and the way people think about how they use their infrastructure is, in my opinion, long term, a very sustainable strategy. And we've got differentiation, and that's what we're using.\n\n---\n\nI had a 2-parter question for you. The first part is -- Larry, maybe talk a little bit about 12c and how you think it influences the hardware business next year. I know there's a -- the c can stand for cloud. But I'd be curious to get your take on the consolidation opportunity. And then as part of that, Safra made a quick comment about, I think, the renewal rates in your largest revenue line around license update and support. I'd love to get a little more color from there and how you're seeing 12c influence maintenance renewals and customers subscribing for support.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I'll start with 12c in terms of its rate of uptake there. There are 2 key aspects of 12c, one that came out with the initial release, which is the multi-tenant feature, that's why it's called 12c for the cloud. It literally takes any application that you've got, any Oracle application you've got and makes it a multi-tenant application. Even companies like salesforce.com, who we're both a supplier and a -- to salesforce.com and a competitor with salesforce.com. I just recently got a note from Marc Benioff who's excited about bringing in Exadata and 12c and making that the basis of salesforce.com's cloud computing infrastructure, that they put their application on. So we're seeing adopters with very, very high standards in terms of having to supply millions of users reliably and cost effectively in the cloud, talk about moving their entire business to 12c and Exadata. That's just the tip of the iceberg, these hyperscale companies. We think virtually all of our customers are on their way to moving to 12c. Now some -- the early adopters, and then there's the rest of the guys who come down on -- down the road a bit later. But we think it's very attractive to our conventional customers and to hyperscale customers like Salesforce and others. I'll let -- the second piece is the in-memory piece. And we think that comes out this summer, comes out June, basically, June, July, August, something like that. And we think that's going to accelerate the adoption of 12c a lot. I think the performance gains there are so dramatic, we think people will -- even the people who like to wait a while for the new features and make -- maybe wait 6 months or 1 year before they try it out, there are people trying it out now -- hundreds of people trying it out now before it's even released. So we think this is a unique feature in terms of being able to have a huge payoff right away. And we think 12c will be the most rapidly adopted new release in many, many years for those 2 reasons, in-memory and multi-tenancy features. I'll let Safra comment about the renewal rates.\n\n---\n\nThe renewal rates in database are always extremely strong. Folks make really long-term bets on our database. And because we just continue to provide the kind of innovation Larry's talking about, they are -- they always renew. I mean, it doesn't make sense not to. They get just so much enormous value. We continue to invest in the database, as Larry just mentioned. And as a result, renewal rates remain extremely, extremely high for the database, for all our products, to be frank. But database is always great. And it remained again that way this quarter and all year.\n\n---\n\nMark, I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the comments you made about modern Middleware and data analytics. If you could help highlight your strategy for us, as well as if you can go over with us your competitive positioning.\n\n---\n\nSure. Yes, I mean, I think as I mentioned, the Middleware growth was strong. Underneath it, data analytics was very, very strong. Our growth in data analytics was -- in the tech part of data analytics was greater than 40%. So it's a big number now. We've done several things. One, we've seen a couple of shifts. Well first, we've added a lot of salespeople. Second, with the addition of our Endeca product line, more addition of Exalytics, we brought a lot of new technology to the space. We've also seen the competitors that we compete with shift. Traditionally, Oracle would see BusinessObjects and Cognos, and we actually see Tableau a lot more than we see those 2 at this point. And frankly, I think the integration work we've done within Endeca with Exalytics has paid off. The sales people we brought have paid off. And you see it show up in our results. There are other things in Middleware, Heather, that performed very well as well. But of materiality, that's probably the one to call out, which is data analytics.\n\n---\n\nIf I could just add one thing to that. With the release of Oracle in-memory database with 12c, our data analytics performance is going to increase by more than a factor of 10, some cases it's up more than a factor of 100. So we think this summer, with 12c, our data analytics business is going to take off. And of course, the intention is to sell a lot of those data analytics products in the cloud as opposed to on-premise. We will give customers a choice, but we'll offer that data analytics in the cloud, data analytics on premise. It's a big push for us. As Mark said, we see new competitors and an opportunity, and once again, to move to the front of the pack, to become the #1 data analytics company in the world. We think the new competitors are small and innovative. The old competitors have a lot of market share, and we think that market share is there for the taking as long as we can deliver high-quality technology, and that's what we'll do this summer.\n\n---\n\nI should have mentioned that, too. Larry triggered that thought. We did announce some BI offerings in the cloud in the quarter. And so while not yet a material part of our revenue, an awful exciting offering to add to everything else that I and Larry mentioned, in terms of what we're bringing to the market. So we're excited about the space. We think there's opportunity for us to gain material share here.\n\n---\n\nFor Larry, can you update us on your progress in delivering your infrastructure stack in the cloud delivered as Platform as a Service? And are there any metrics you can give us on the traction that you're seeing there?\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, it's available on a limited basis right now. It's going to -- it's going to be available in both Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service. We've done all the pricing. The Infrastructure as a Service, the new price pretty much equivalent to Amazon, that really -- we think that's a commodity business and not in any way a bad -- in a bad sense. To play that game, you have to be -- we're going to have a compute service and a storage service. The storage service is already out, the compute service is going to be released in NAS shortly. And that will be very competitive, we think, with Amazon or anybody else in this business. The big differentiator for us, is along with Infrastructure as a Service, we have a very strong Platform as a Service offering coming out with our infrastructure. And that, of course, our 2 major platform plays. In Middleware, it's Java and the database, of course, it's Oracle. We think that gives us a unique pair of differentiators in the Infrastructure or Platform as a Service as taken together. And we think that's what our customers are going to do. Customers are going to come to us and buy our platform in the cloud, and buy infrastructure in the cloud, and move a lot of their existing applications off -- out of their own data centers into our cloud and they suddenly -- and they can do that without having to change their applications at all. So you can move their applications intact to our cloud and get all of the cost benefits, all of the efficiencies of scale, and they don't have to change the apps at all. We think that's a unique proposition that we offer our customers. And again, delivery time is all this summer.\n\n---\n\nJust want to build on that last question on the cloud. At OpenWorld, you guys talked about some metrics in terms of Fusion Applications in the cloud and the percentage of customers that are choosing cloud-based deployment of Fusion. Wondering if you could comment on just what you've been saying over the past few quarters there. And then also, just competitively, with Fusion in the cloud, what are you seeing out there, versus Workday, versus salesforce.com? And now that Fusion apps and Fusion apps in the cloud have been out there for, obviously, multiple quarters?\n\n---\n\nWell, I'll take -- I think what you asked was the deployment of Fusion on-premise versus cloud. I think that's what you asked, and it's cloud, cloud, cloud. So I mean -- let me repeat it one more time, cloud, cloud, cloud is generally where Fusion is deployed. So we've had great success with it. We have great adoption. I think one of the things that's important -- I've seen some opinions. I won't credit a source, there are growth rates -- these exciting growth rates we're describing are coming from acquired properties as opposed to Fusion activities. And I want to make sure I'm clear, Phil, to refute that. Now, it doesn't mean -- I love acquired properties too, so I love them all. But I just want to make sure it's clear in the numbers that our Fusion products are growing very fast, faster than our overall growth rate. Now as it relates to your conversation about Workday, I tried to be as transparent as I could be. I got -- we've got the good fortune that they're transparent in most cases. Although I didn't get to see their customer list this quarter. In previous quarters, I hear their numbers, and we just have more new customers than they do. So it seems like a good metric to me, and we'll continue to see as we move going forward. But we're very comfortable competing with them. We felt very good about release 7. As I told you, we're now in release 8. We're very comfortable with that product. We've gotten our sales organization trained, and we're very comfortable competing with them, and of course, we're growing off a bigger base than them. With Salesforce, we do all of what Larry described, we compete with them. They're a customer at the same time. But in sales automation, were competing with them. We had very strong growth in Fusion sales auto in the quarter. And we're very comfortable with also our position in service cloud. Now that's right now acquired product. But we feel very good about both, but we've added now also the capability in marketing. So we bought a B2B marketing, a leading market automation company B2B in Eloqua. We supplemented that with the leading B2C company in Responsys. And we've now announced our intention to acquire BlueKai. So we believe we have a leadership position in marketing automation, leadership position in service automation. We're on the attack in sales automation, although clearly #2 to Salesforce at that point. But we believe the ecosystem we've now laid out is second to no one and the leading position in the marketplace. And I think it's showing up in our results.\n\n---\n\nFirst, Mark, any tweaks -- what are the things that are working successfully from a sales execution, go-to-market standpoint that you plan on emphasizing as you look at your business next year? And one for you Safra. Deferred revenues, down sequentially. Can you expand upon what might have contributed to that?\n\n---\n\nI'll start and let Safra finish. I mean, we've obviously added a lot of capacity. We feel very good about the capacity we've added. We're very focused on those people being very productive. So what you see us investing a lot now is training. I probably mentioned training 3 times during this call. And so as our product set continues to get -- just continues to get better and better and better, and our salespeople now have more time in seat, training is a big deal. Now we will add people next year, as Larry talked about some exciting stuff we now have in platform and in infrastructure, so you'll see us add salespeople. And as we start to compete with again a new competitor, as it relates to platform and infrastructure, you'll see us do some supplemental adding in some other places, but a real keen focus, Kash, on productivity and making these people -- because you can imagine towards -- I guess, the size of our sales force, we have billions of dollars of revenue associated with the productivity gains we can make with the capacity we now have in this company from a sales perspective.\n\n---\n\nIf I can add one thing, I mean, just to scale it. As we roll out Platform as a Service and Infrastructure as a Service, we will have specialists selling nothing but Platform as a Service and nothing but Infrastructure as a Service. And we'll have someplace between 500 and 1,000 of them that we're going to add next fiscal year, starting with the class. This is around the world. So again, we go back to this thing that we have a new set of competitors, and we need specialist sales teams that are used to competing with Amazon, other specialist sales teams that are used to competing with IBM pSeries. It's a different sale to a different customer quite often. And so we have -- we're lining up against all of our new competitors and making sure we have sales capacity, as well as a competitive product.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Kash, the Q3 deferred revenues are following the exact same seasonal pattern that they always follow, including last year. So though they're sequentially down, that's really because Q4 is the peak for support renewals, et cetera. And it always goes down from Q2 to Q3 sequentially. I do want to remind you, of course, that it is up over $200 million over the same quarter last year. And that's really what you should be looking at. There's nothing going on as far as burning down or whatever. It's simply the same thing we have every Q3, where it's just as it burns down the big Q4 renewals, and it shows up right there in that line. That's it.\n\n---\n\nLarry, big data is obviously a huge opportunity for Oracle, given your strength in database and traction with Engineered Systems. But from an apps perspective, can you talk about the opportunity to differentiate and drive growth by leveraging big data within the apps themselves? And do you see big data as more of its own category? Or a feature of next-generation applications?\n\n---\n\nI think it's an underlying category. For example, there's no doubt that in-memory databases allow us to analyze large amounts of data more quickly. The fact that our Exadata machines have multiple tiers of caching. We now not only have DRAM and rotating storage, we have a lot of flash memory that we have to manage. It allows us to manage huge amounts of -- huge databases, multi-petabyte databases, and deliver very high performance. So no, we think of big data as an underlying set of technologies. For batch, if you want a big data batch process, the open-source product Hadoop is a very good product, if you're doing batch processing. If you're doing big data realtime processing, then we think the Oracle Database is by far and away, the best manage -- best technology for managing realtime processing of big data. We think this is a category where we're already the leader. And in fact, we're gaining on our competitors. If you look at all of our database competitors, both relational and non-relational databases, we're taking share both on the SQL area and we're growing a lot faster than the no-SQL area. So we're very comfortable that the improvements we've made to our database will allow us to prosper in the big data era. But again, we think of it -- and of course, any application then written on top of Oracle can exploit that data and that application becomes enriched. So our telecommunications billing system, which has to manage huge amounts of transactions with millions and millions of customers, be able to figure out whether to cut off a phone call when someone exceeds their bill and do all of that realtime, that's realtime processing of huge amounts of data by a phone company. Those are the kind of applications we provide that almost no one else can provide.\n\n---\n\nSafra, year-to-date, CapEx spending's down about 9%. I know in the past, you've been fairly adamant about not needing to really ramp up CapEx like a lot of your competitors have had. But given the really strong 60% bookings growth in cloud, has any of the thinking changed there?\n\n---\n\nRemember, we have enormous scale that we have not fully tapped. We've been making investments this whole time. And so there'll be -- we will continue to invest as we do now. We have obviously some visibility into our contracts that we've signed. But we have so much scale that we've been investing in for years, much of it still available. And so we're very comfortable where we're at right now. And we budgeted to it, and I don't think you'll be seeing any massive gapping just because our size is so large. And because we have our own hardware, we have our own systems, we can really thoroughly optimize for our applications with compression and all these other things that other folks just don't have the benefit and luxury that we have.\n\n---\n\nYes. We think, with our Engineered Systems and our data compression technology, we can deliver the same storage and the same compute capacity of our competitors for a lot less money. I mean, that's what we're selling -- we're selling this technology to our customers. That's our pitch. And we think we can build our own data centers just as efficiently. And that's why I don't think you'll ever see our CapEx approach our infrastructure competitors in the cloud.\n\n---\n\nNo. No.\n\n---\n\nThank you. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be reached in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. And we look forward to speaking with you. \r\nThanks for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for closing.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Karl Keirstead (Analysts)】\nMy question is for Mark. I guess the stronger momentum in Oracle's cloud software bookings and revenue growth really jumped out at me among the data points in the release. I know you gave some good color by product. Wondering if you might add a little bit more depth to help us understand what the broader drivers were. Was it Oracle doing a better job cross-selling on acquisitions? Was it the better functionality in Fusion version 7? Maybe any other factors that you think are worth highlighting.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nYes. I mean -- and the good news I'd tell you is that we're just better at almost every part of this. I mean, I really don't know how much, how -- I think we felt we knew a lot a year ago or a couple of years ago. We just know a lot more now. We're better at -- we're better from a product perspective. I talked to you a little bit about what we've got in release 8. I mean, its 1,000 new features across the entire release. So big, big jump from a product perspective. We obviously have more feet on the street than we had. And certainly not just more feet on the street, but they've been in place longer. They've been now trained multiple times. And clearly, the perception in the market now has improved a better cloud position. I think last quarter, our 35% growth was good news, and clearly, this 60% growth is even better news. So I think that will help us as well. But it is broad based, Karl. So there's no one deal in here. There's no one product line that drove it. It's really across all of our product lines. As I mentioned, our Fusion products, our organic Fusion products, really had a fantastic quarter. Fusion HCM, Fusion sales automation and Fusion ERP, all 3, very strong. And it's really true across most regions as well. I don't have a region story that would be unique to the growth rate. It was fairly consistent across all regions. So I hope that's helpful.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Raimo Lenschow (Analysts)】\nThe other area that stood out this quarter was hardware. And it fits -- it's a bit puzzling, because like if I look at the IBM numbers, they are declining quite significantly. You mentioned some of the drivers there already. Can you just kind of go a little bit deeper in there and also kind of how you see that kind of -- we've been waiting for a turnaround in hardware for a while? Now all the things that you're talking are coming through. Is that kind of something sustainable? And how do you see that playing out against the competition going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nIt's absolutely sustainable because Engineered Systems has been growing rapidly for a long time. We keep talking about it. Now the problem has -- a couple of years ago, was Engineered Systems was a small percentage of the total. Now Engineered Systems has grown up to be over 30% of the total. So there's very -- and soon, it's going to be 1/2 of the total. So that's very, very positive. The x86 commodity business, which used to be a big business when we bought Sun, has now shrunk to almost nothing. So our hardware business has gone through the transition where we've gotten out of the commodity storage business, we've gotten out of the commodity server business and replaced it with computing systems with a lot of our own intellectual property. There -- these businesses are growing rapidly and have very good margins. The reason we compete with IBM pSeries all the time head-to-head. And it's not uncommon for our systems to go -- to be several times faster than IBM. Let me give you one example, without saying who the competitor was. We replaced a system at -- in the world's largest cloud company. You guys can figure out who that is, world's largest cloud company. We delivered an Exadata system to them. They moved their application and got it live in 3 weeks and experienced 10x better performance at a fraction of the cost. This is not uncommon, when we install an Exadata machine or a SPARC SuperCluster, to have a very rapid implementation, deliver terrific performance at a dramatically lower overall cost because all of the complexity of integration is done by us, not by them.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nI'd add to your comment, you asked if it was sustainable. What I'd hope you'd be encouraged by was if you looked at our performance over the past several quarters, you've seen the reflection of our execution of our strategy in hardware support. You've seen hardware support continued to incline year-over-year and sequentially in terms of its performance. We grew now at 7% in Q3, which is a reflection of what Larry described. The fact that there is higher Oracle IP directly relates to our attach rates and eventually what turns into hardware support. So we now have our core businesses that have all been refreshed, and that's why I mentioned it. Our T-Systems, our Network Attached Storage or ZFS storage and our Engineered Systems are now almost 70% of our revenue. And all 3 of those are growing. And they are gaining share. So it's sustainable. I -- listen, I can't predict the macro, but I can predict we will continue to gain share. And to add to Larry's point, we just don't compete with the server vendors, we actually do a lot of other things than just compete with an IBM. I mean, we compete with EMC, frankly, when we get into those environments, because we radically change our customer's storage requirements. If our customers got a petabyte of storage, we can -- we know how to compress that data, with Exadata, to where they may only need to use 100 terabytes. And so this opportunity for us to now change the game and the way people think about how they use their infrastructure is, in my opinion, long term, a very sustainable strategy. And we've got differentiation, and that's what we're using.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Maynard (Analysts)】\nI had a 2-parter question for you. The first part is -- Larry, maybe talk a little bit about 12c and how you think it influences the hardware business next year. I know there's a -- the c can stand for cloud. But I'd be curious to get your take on the consolidation opportunity. And then as part of that, Safra made a quick comment about, I think, the renewal rates in your largest revenue line around license update and support. I'd love to get a little more color from there and how you're seeing 12c influence maintenance renewals and customers subscribing for support.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nOkay. I'll start with 12c in terms of its rate of uptake there. There are 2 key aspects of 12c, one that came out with the initial release, which is the multi-tenant feature, that's why it's called 12c for the cloud. It literally takes any application that you've got, any Oracle application you've got and makes it a multi-tenant application. Even companies like salesforce.com, who we're both a supplier and a -- to salesforce.com and a competitor with salesforce.com. I just recently got a note from Marc Benioff who's excited about bringing in Exadata and 12c and making that the basis of salesforce.com's cloud computing infrastructure, that they put their application on. So we're seeing adopters with very, very high standards in terms of having to supply millions of users reliably and cost effectively in the cloud, talk about moving their entire business to 12c and Exadata. That's just the tip of the iceberg, these hyperscale companies. We think virtually all of our customers are on their way to moving to 12c. Now some -- the early adopters, and then there's the rest of the guys who come down on -- down the road a bit later. But we think it's very attractive to our conventional customers and to hyperscale customers like Salesforce and others. I'll let -- the second piece is the in-memory piece. And we think that comes out this summer, comes out June, basically, June, July, August, something like that. And we think that's going to accelerate the adoption of 12c a lot. I think the performance gains there are so dramatic, we think people will -- even the people who like to wait a while for the new features and make -- maybe wait 6 months or 1 year before they try it out, there are people trying it out now -- hundreds of people trying it out now before it's even released. So we think this is a unique feature in terms of being able to have a huge payoff right away. And we think 12c will be the most rapidly adopted new release in many, many years for those 2 reasons, in-memory and multi-tenancy features. I'll let Safra comment about the renewal rates.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nThe renewal rates in database are always extremely strong. Folks make really long-term bets on our database. And because we just continue to provide the kind of innovation Larry's talking about, they are -- they always renew. I mean, it doesn't make sense not to. They get just so much enormous value. We continue to invest in the database, as Larry just mentioned. And as a result, renewal rates remain extremely, extremely high for the database, for all our products, to be frank. But database is always great. And it remained again that way this quarter and all year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Heather Bellini (Analysts)】\nMark, I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the comments you made about modern Middleware and data analytics. If you could help highlight your strategy for us, as well as if you can go over with us your competitive positioning.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nSure. Yes, I mean, I think as I mentioned, the Middleware growth was strong. Underneath it, data analytics was very, very strong. Our growth in data analytics was -- in the tech part of data analytics was greater than 40%. So it's a big number now. We've done several things. One, we've seen a couple of shifts. Well first, we've added a lot of salespeople. Second, with the addition of our Endeca product line, more addition of Exalytics, we brought a lot of new technology to the space. We've also seen the competitors that we compete with shift. Traditionally, Oracle would see BusinessObjects and Cognos, and we actually see Tableau a lot more than we see those 2 at this point. And frankly, I think the integration work we've done within Endeca with Exalytics has paid off. The sales people we brought have paid off. And you see it show up in our results. There are other things in Middleware, Heather, that performed very well as well. But of materiality, that's probably the one to call out, which is data analytics.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nIf I could just add one thing to that. With the release of Oracle in-memory database with 12c, our data analytics performance is going to increase by more than a factor of 10, some cases it's up more than a factor of 100. So we think this summer, with 12c, our data analytics business is going to take off. And of course, the intention is to sell a lot of those data analytics products in the cloud as opposed to on-premise. We will give customers a choice, but we'll offer that data analytics in the cloud, data analytics on premise. It's a big push for us. As Mark said, we see new competitors and an opportunity, and once again, to move to the front of the pack, to become the #1 data analytics company in the world. We think the new competitors are small and innovative. The old competitors have a lot of market share, and we think that market share is there for the taking as long as we can deliver high-quality technology, and that's what we'll do this summer.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nI should have mentioned that, too. Larry triggered that thought. We did announce some BI offerings in the cloud in the quarter. And so while not yet a material part of our revenue, an awful exciting offering to add to everything else that I and Larry mentioned, in terms of what we're bringing to the market. So we're excited about the space. We think there's opportunity for us to gain material share here.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Sherlund (Analysts)】\nFor Larry, can you update us on your progress in delivering your infrastructure stack in the cloud delivered as Platform as a Service? And are there any metrics you can give us on the traction that you're seeing there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nYes. Well, it's available on a limited basis right now. It's going to -- it's going to be available in both Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service. We've done all the pricing. The Infrastructure as a Service, the new price pretty much equivalent to Amazon, that really -- we think that's a commodity business and not in any way a bad -- in a bad sense. To play that game, you have to be -- we're going to have a compute service and a storage service. The storage service is already out, the compute service is going to be released in NAS shortly. And that will be very competitive, we think, with Amazon or anybody else in this business. The big differentiator for us, is along with Infrastructure as a Service, we have a very strong Platform as a Service offering coming out with our infrastructure. And that, of course, our 2 major platform plays. In Middleware, it's Java and the database, of course, it's Oracle. We think that gives us a unique pair of differentiators in the Infrastructure or Platform as a Service as taken together. And we think that's what our customers are going to do. Customers are going to come to us and buy our platform in the cloud, and buy infrastructure in the cloud, and move a lot of their existing applications off -- out of their own data centers into our cloud and they suddenly -- and they can do that without having to change their applications at all. So you can move their applications intact to our cloud and get all of the cost benefits, all of the efficiencies of scale, and they don't have to change the apps at all. We think that's a unique proposition that we offer our customers. And again, delivery time is all this summer.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Philip Winslow (Analysts)】\nJust want to build on that last question on the cloud. At OpenWorld, you guys talked about some metrics in terms of Fusion Applications in the cloud and the percentage of customers that are choosing cloud-based deployment of Fusion. Wondering if you could comment on just what you've been saying over the past few quarters there. And then also, just competitively, with Fusion in the cloud, what are you seeing out there, versus Workday, versus salesforce.com? And now that Fusion apps and Fusion apps in the cloud have been out there for, obviously, multiple quarters?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nWell, I'll take -- I think what you asked was the deployment of Fusion on-premise versus cloud. I think that's what you asked, and it's cloud, cloud, cloud. So I mean -- let me repeat it one more time, cloud, cloud, cloud is generally where Fusion is deployed. So we've had great success with it. We have great adoption. I think one of the things that's important -- I've seen some opinions. I won't credit a source, there are growth rates -- these exciting growth rates we're describing are coming from acquired properties as opposed to Fusion activities. And I want to make sure I'm clear, Phil, to refute that. Now, it doesn't mean -- I love acquired properties too, so I love them all. But I just want to make sure it's clear in the numbers that our Fusion products are growing very fast, faster than our overall growth rate. Now as it relates to your conversation about Workday, I tried to be as transparent as I could be. I got -- we've got the good fortune that they're transparent in most cases. Although I didn't get to see their customer list this quarter. In previous quarters, I hear their numbers, and we just have more new customers than they do. So it seems like a good metric to me, and we'll continue to see as we move going forward. But we're very comfortable competing with them. We felt very good about release 7. As I told you, we're now in release 8. We're very comfortable with that product. We've gotten our sales organization trained, and we're very comfortable competing with them, and of course, we're growing off a bigger base than them. With Salesforce, we do all of what Larry described, we compete with them. They're a customer at the same time. But in sales automation, were competing with them. We had very strong growth in Fusion sales auto in the quarter. And we're very comfortable with also our position in service cloud. Now that's right now acquired product. But we feel very good about both, but we've added now also the capability in marketing. So we bought a B2B marketing, a leading market automation company B2B in Eloqua. We supplemented that with the leading B2C company in Responsys. And we've now announced our intention to acquire BlueKai. So we believe we have a leadership position in marketing automation, leadership position in service automation. We're on the attack in sales automation, although clearly #2 to Salesforce at that point. But we believe the ecosystem we've now laid out is second to no one and the leading position in the marketplace. And I think it's showing up in our results.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kash Rangan (Analysts)】\nFirst, Mark, any tweaks -- what are the things that are working successfully from a sales execution, go-to-market standpoint that you plan on emphasizing as you look at your business next year? And one for you Safra. Deferred revenues, down sequentially. Can you expand upon what might have contributed to that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nI'll start and let Safra finish. I mean, we've obviously added a lot of capacity. We feel very good about the capacity we've added. We're very focused on those people being very productive. So what you see us investing a lot now is training. I probably mentioned training 3 times during this call. And so as our product set continues to get -- just continues to get better and better and better, and our salespeople now have more time in seat, training is a big deal.

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex's third quarter fiscal 2014 results. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.\r\nYesterday afternoon, after the market closed, we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2014. We also filed our Form 10-Q, which provides additional discussion and analysis of the results for the quarter. These documents are available, of course, by accessing our Investor Relations page at www.paychex.com. And this teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 1 month.\r\nOn today's call, I will share my thoughts on our results and update you on how we're doing in operations, sales and product development areas. And Efrain will review our third quarter financial highlights and discuss our full year guidance, and then we'll open it up for your questions.\r\nWe are pleased with our results in the third quarter. We continue to make progress driving new business revenue and selling more value-added services and increasing revenue from our client base. We released additional enhancements to our online and mid-market products. And in fact, we will be releasing the next version of our mobile app user interface this week. \r\nAlong with these technology enhancements, we remain focused on providing industry-leading service to our clients and their employees. Efrain will go into more detail on the financial results and comparisons. However, I'd like to provide you with some highlights of the quarter.\r\nTotal service revenue showed good growth of 7% for the quarter. Payroll service revenue growth of 5% was supported by solid results in the core payroll product. HRS revenue increased 12% in the third quarter, as we continue to benefit from demand for human resource outsourcing solutions and strong execution, highlighted, particularly, in the PEO business.\r\nChecks per payroll have improved for 16 consecutive quarters now. Third quarter growth was 1%, moderating a bit from the first half of the fiscal year. \r\nFrom a sales perspective, we continue to experience good new business revenue growth, particularly in core payroll and Paychex HR outsourcing solutions. Our execution in service operations also continued to be excellent. The team did a great job for our clients with year-end processing, including the distribution of our W-2s and year-end reporting ahead of schedule. I also want to note that our business continuity plans have performed extremely well through severe winter conditions that many of our clients experienced, ensuring that our clients' needs are serviced even in the worst conditions. This is probably one of the toughest winters that we've gone through from a service perspective, and then we've just done an excellent job, particularly on the East Coast, as we went through a number of storms.\r\nI'm proud of the partnership and the service commitment demonstrated by our employees that continue to result in client satisfaction and client retention results that remain at very high levels. This effort is really a testament to the strength of our client service model, always putting our clients first.\r\nFrom a technology perspective, continued investment in our SaaS solutions and mobility offerings position us for long-term growth. We have market-leading SaaS solutions levering the latest technologies. Our online HR administration and time and attendance products are integrated with our Paychex Next Generation offering. We are experiencing increased demand for our SaaS solutions across our client base.\r\nWe continue to invest significantly in our online capabilities, as well as our mobile applications. And whether you're a client or a client employee, our mobile app provides clean and efficient access to all the area of information with 1 to 2 clicks. We give clients the ability to start, edit and submit their payroll with the best mobility app in the marketplace. And as I mentioned, we will be introducing the latest version of the mobile offering this week.\r\nDuring the third quarter, we officially initiated our operations in São Paulo, Brazil and enhanced our portfolio of value-added products and services with the official introduction of Paychex payment-processing services. This is a full suite of payment-processing solutions, including credit and debit card processing, mobile and online payment services and point-of-sale solutions, designed to meet the evolving needs of today's small businesses. This service is being offered in partnership with Elavon, a leading global payments provider. \r\nIn the past few quarters, I've talked about our new products designed to help our clients manage compliance requirements of the Affordable Care Act, or more commonly known as health care reform. We continue to execute on the rollout of those product offerings in this area, including our Paychex Employer Shared Responsibility Service, a more robust monitoring service in our Paychex Benefit Account. These products, while new to the market, represent an opportunity for us as we are uniquely positioned as both a payroll provider and insurance agency to help small businesses with these regulations.\r\nThe frequent changes in ACA rules have caused some clients to delay decisions on purchasing products or making changes to their health care plans. However, we continue to see health care reform as an opportunity for us as we are able to provide clients with the most up-to-date information on the latest requirements.\r\nWe also continue our shareholder-friendly actions. We increased our dividend back in July, 6%, to $0.35 per share. And we continue to repurchase Paychex stock opportunistically, and we have repurchased approximately 5 million shares of common stock in the first 9 months of fiscal 2014.\r\nAnd finally, last week, we announced that on April 1, 2014, just next week, in conjunction with IHS Inc., we will launch the Paychex|IHS Small Business Jobs Index. This is a new monthly index that examines the state of small business employment in the U.S. By measuring aggregated small business payroll data from a subset of our small business client base, the index will identify and track small business employment trends and provide probably the most real-timely, accurate insight into national and regional employment activity, as well as report on state and metro employment trends for many of the country's largest states and metropolitan markets. This index does not indicate Paychex's financial results.\r\nIn summary, I am pleased with our results for the third quarter and I appreciate the great work of our Paychex employee team across all organizations from sales to service. And I will now turn over the call to Efrain Rivera to review the financial results in more detail. Efrain?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Marty. I'd like to remind everyone that during today's conference call, we'll make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such, involve risks. Refer to our press release for a discussion of forward-looking statements and related risk factors.\r\nAs Marty indicated, our third quarter financial results for fiscal 2014 represented good progress. There are a number of -- there are some of the key highlights for the quarter and 9 months that I'll talk about now, and I'll provide greater detail in several areas and wrap with a review of the 2014 outlook.\r\nTotal service revenue grew 7% for both the third quarter and the 9 months, $626 million and $1.8 billion, respectively. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 3% for the third quarter and 1% for the 9 months to $11 million and $31 million, respectively. This result was due to a lower average interest rate, partially offset by an increase in average investment balances. \r\nExpenses increased 5% for both the third quarter and the 9 months. The increase was mainly in compensation-related costs with higher wages and higher performance based comp. Wages were impacted by our investment in product development and supporting technology and new sales initiatives implemented in fiscal 2013.\r\nFor the 9 months, we also experienced higher sales-related costs attributable to new business revenue growth. \r\nWe maintained strong operating margins of 38.4% for the third quarter and 39.7% for the 9 months.\r\nOperating income, net of certain items, increased 12% for the third quarter and 9% for the 9 months. We expect operating margin for the full year to be approximately 38%.\r\nNet income increased 11% to $160 million for the third quarter and 8% to $482 million for the 9-month period. \r\nDiluted earnings per share increased 10% to $0.44 per share for the third quarter and 7% to $1.31 per share for the 9 months.\r\nTurning to payroll service revenue. It increased 5% for the third quarter and 4% for the 9 months. We benefited from increases in checks per payroll, revenue per client and client bases. As Marty already mentioned, our checks per payroll growth metric continued to improve, with the rate of growth moderating from earlier in the year as we expected. Checks per payroll increased 1% for the quarter and for the 9-month period, 1.5%.\r\nRevenue per check grew as a result of price increases, net of discount, coupled with the impact of increased product penetration. \r\nThe third quarter payroll revenue growth was bolstered by 1 additional payroll-processing day in the quarter compared with the same period last year. The estimated impact on payroll revenue growth was in the range of 0.5% to 1%. Note that payroll revenue growth is expected to moderate in the fourth quarter due to 1 less payroll-processing day compared to the prior year. And we anticipate that payroll service revenue growth in the fourth quarter will be at the low end of the full year range.\r\nHRS. HRS revenue increased 12% for both the third quarter and the 9 months. We continue to experience rapid growth in both our ASO and PEO, as well as in our online HR administration products. \r\nHRS revenue increase reflects client growth, primarily in HR Solutions, retirement services and online HR administration products. Our online HR administration products continue to grow due to the success in sales of SaaS solutions. \r\nWithin HR Solutions, the PEO continued to show strong growth in the number of client employees served.\r\nRetirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in the average asset value participant funds. Insurance services revenue growth reflected higher premiums in workers' comp insurance services and an increase in the number of health and benefits applicants. \r\nHRS revenue growth was tempered modestly in the 9-month period by higher direct costs in our PEO. Note that HRS revenue quarterly growth can vary due to the volume of clients, PEO workers' compensation and basis points earned on retirement services client employee funds, basis points change due to fluctuations in the financial market and the asset value of funds invested. PEO net service revenue also exhibits greater variability between quarters due to a number of factors, including change in the workers' comp claims experience.\r\nTurning to our investment portfolio. In the short-term portfolio, our primary investment vehicles are -- remain high-quality variable rate demand notes and bank demand deposit accounts. In the longer-term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit-quality municipal bonds. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.7% and an average duration of 3.1 years.\r\nOur combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 0.9% for the third quarter compared to 1% for the same period last year. For the 9 months, we earned 1% compared to 1.1% for the same period last year.\r\nAverage balances for interest on funds held for clients increased during both the third quarter and the 9 months due to growth in checks per payroll and the client base. For the 9 months, average balances benefited from the expiration of certain payroll tax cuts on December 31, 2012, which resulted in higher Social Security withholdings.\r\nLet's turn to the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong. Cash and total corporate investments totaled $964 million as of February 28, 2014, and we have no debt. Funds held for clients as of February 28, 2014, were $4.9 billion compared to $4.1 billion as of May 31, 2013. \r\nFunds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.7 billion for the 9 months, a year-over-year increase of 5%.\r\nOur total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $39 million as of February 28, 2014, compared with net unrealized gains of $35 million as of May 31, 2013.\r\nTotal shareholders' equity was $1.8 billion as of February 28, reflecting $383 million in dividends paid during the first 9 months. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 34%.\r\nCash flows from operations were $706 million for the first 9 months, a 16% increase compared to the prior year. This increase was driven by higher net income, higher noncash adjustments to net income, mostly higher amortization on premiums of available-for-sale securities, along with higher depreciation in stock-based comp cost and changes in our operating assets and liabilities related primarily to timing. \r\nI'd like to remind you that our outlook, turning to fiscal 2014 guidance for the remainder of the year, is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. \r\nAs I had mentioned, the growth rate for payroll services revenue is expected to be at the low end of the full year range in the fourth quarter as a result of 1 less processing day compared to the same period last year. \r\nOur payroll service revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 3% to 4% for the full year and at the high end of that range. \r\nHRS revenue growth is also expected to be at the low end of the full year range for the full -- fourth quarter for similar reasons and because we believe there will be a moderation in HR Solutions performance. Overall, HRS growth is expected to be in the range of 10% to 11% for the full year.\r\nTotal service revenue is anticipated to be in the range of previous guidance, although at the high end of that range. \r\nNet income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 9% to 10%, adjusted up slightly from previous guidance. A reminder then, in the fourth quarter of last year, we recognized an additional tax provision for the settlement of a state tax issue, which impacted diluted earnings per share.\r\nOur operating margin for the year is anticipated to be approximately 38%. And as I've mentioned to many of you, 38% can be anything up to 38.5%, and we don't call it to the nearest half percent. This is slightly lower than the margin experienced in the first 9 months of fiscal 2014 as our margins are historically lower in the second half of the fiscal year.\r\nFinally, thanks to those of you who participated in our investor day survey. Based on survey feedback, we decided to move it later in fiscal year '15, and we'll provide further information as we finalize details.\r\nThank you very much, and let me turn it back over to Marty.\n\n---\n\nGood. Thanks, Efrain. Operator, we'll now open the meeting to questions.",

      "transcript_text3": "Can you just give us a sense of, now that the key selling season is over, how your sales force did relative to the quotas that they had during the key selling season? And are you still expecting to be, or I should say, where are you expecting to be in kind of your 1% to 3% target range for organic client growth this year, now that you did get through the key selling season? I'm guessing you've got some better visibility on where you might land in that range?\n\n---\n\nYes, I don't -- Jason, it's Marty. We don't -- actually, we don't give the client growth number until the end of the year, as you know, because we want to get through the whole year. But I would say on -- from the sales execution in selling season, continued solid performance there, so particularly in the HRS side, in core payroll and HR small business and in the HRS side, particularly in the PEO. As we've said in some comments, we feel really strong, and the PEO came in really strong in year. And I think that's health care reform, I think that's just a real resurgence there, and that's been good. But really, overall, a very -- continued solid execution from a sales perspective.\n\n---\n\nAnd Jason, just to add to what Marty said, we don't give the specifics, but we feel very comfortable that we're within that range.\n\n---\n\nOkay. That's helpful. And I think in the past, over the last several quarters or so, when you guys have asked -- have been asked where pricing is running in core payroll, it seems like you've indicated it's been closer to the lower end of that longer-term 2% to 4% range that you had laid out at the analyst meeting a couple of years ago. Was that the case again during this quarter?\n\n---\n\nYes. We're still feeling good retention from a client base and from a revenue -- I guess, I'd say, capture perspective. We feel good about holding the price increase that we did last year. And I would think we never really changed that range going forward. And we wouldn't want to get any more specific than that coming up.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just last question. I think you mentioned some good traction on the SaaS side of the business. Can you give us any sense just in terms of mix of new sales, how you've seen that shift? Presumably, the SaaS mix there has been increasing, but any numbers you could give us just to help convey how much demand you've seen for SaaS, perhaps relative to the classic full-service outsourced model?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's an interesting mix. I'll give you a comment and then let Efrain pick up, as well. But it's -- our model is, we're giving -- over the last few years with all the technology investment and what we've rolled out, we see a much bigger impact of clients moving to the online apps, but it's with our service tied into it. So what we like -- the way we positioned this was deliberately to say, hey, you have a dedicated person, they're available to you, but we have a much more robust online payroll, time and attendance, HR administration solutions for you, as well. So if you want to do it online through the SaaS solution, you can do that. If you want support and use your dedicated person, you can do that. And what we're really starting to see is very much what we hoped, which was a mix of both using the solution. And so many more online clients signing up for online, but then using their serviceperson as well when they need to. So this week, I may put in my own online payroll. I may call for something I need, but I'm putting it in myself. The next week, I may go to the payroll specialist. But we're seeing the biggest push -- online has continued to grow very much. But the biggest push also has been in the time and attendance, and HR solutions, the administration, that are SaaS products online. And we're seeing, across both small and mid-market, some growth in those products that's picking up in penetration in sales. So I wouldn't give exact numbers, but we're certainly seeing a better penetration rate on the new sales, our attachment rate and a better penetration, overall, into the customer base.\n\n---\n\nJason, just to add to what Marty said, when we say SaaS products, we're talking about a suite of products that not only includes core payroll, but includes things like time and attendance, HR administration online. Those are doing very, very well for us. And they are both sold to our core base and also to our -- in the mid-market space. With respect to the low end, the microenterprise-space SaaS, it's doing very well. It's continued to do well. That part of the market -- the low-end SaaS is very attractive to that portion of the market, and SurePayroll plays very, very effectively there.\n\n---\n\nEfrain, you said client growth, you don't want to give out client growth numbers, but you're comfortable within the range you've set. Is there a difference you're witnessing between maybe the SurePayroll type of client versus what I would consider your traditional Paychex type of client in terms of net client growth?\n\n---\n\nSo we look at both, and I think we are satisfied with the performance of both segments of the market. So I think, Kartik, the answer to your question is that we see growth on the low end and we've seen growth in our core client base, also.\n\n---\n\nAnd then, Efrain, you had what I consider a very good margin quarter. It seems like good growth year-over-year. Anything specific as to why margins were really strong this quarter, or is it that just 1 extra day and maybe just management of the expenses? Was there anything else in terms of sales or sales execution or commission that might have impacted that?\n\n---\n\nI think, Kartik, it really -- our model is -- has a significant component of variable expenses associated with it. And when we deliver strong top line growth, the marginal expenses associated with that top line are relatively small. And I think what you see in the model is that when we have strong revenue quarters like we did this quarter, a lot of it flows to the bottom line. And that's the way the model is built. So the more top line growth we deliver, the better leverage we see. Well, I guess I'd characterize it that way. We did -- and in other words, we didn't -- we did everything we were thinking of doing in the quarter from an expense standpoint. There was nothing unusual about our spending pattern.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just one last question, Marty. Have you seen any change or difference in terms of what's happening with your health care insurance business? I know at the beginning of the year, you thought there might be some impact there because of the Affordable Health Care Act. And I'm wondering because of all the changes that are happening or the delays that have been announced, if that's impacted the business any differently than what you had anticipated?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think it certainly has moderated it a bit. I think that what we're finding, as I mentioned in the comments, Kartik, was kind of a lack of decision-making on some parts of the -- of small business and really midsize business because the rules keep changing. And so I think the employers are not sure what to do exactly. So I think that has slowed a little bit from what we had expected or hoped for. The good news is the products are out there, and the products that we've rolled out, giving the tools to the employer, are very hopeful. There's a -- we're finding a lot of confusion from the small business and midsize business space and we're able to help them. So the good news is it's continuing to get us -- our reps in front of them with different products. I guess, I'd say, the moderate news is that they're not buying as much insurance because they're not sure if now it's been pushed off a little bit. And I think you might see that pick up more in toward -- into the summer and the fall as they look at benefit plans and start to see some -- could be some healthy premium increases, and they may look for alternatives from folks like our insurance agency who can give them those tools.\n\n---\n\nI just wanted to ask, you've talked about seeing in the payroll growth I guess better attach rates. Can you -- what is -- I guess what solutions are included within the payroll services growth that you're attaching? And I guess the follow-on or associated question also is, can we look at the revenue per client growth that's helping payroll growth, partly reflecting that you're seeing faster growth within the mid-market necessarily than with smaller clients at this point? Or is that not a good conclusion to draw from the data?\n\n---\n\nNo. I'll start on the product and then let Efrain take that last part. I think, Tim, primarily, what we're seeing is time and attendance solutions picking up, and from a SaaS product standpoint anyway, we're seeing time and attendance solutions that we would have felt were more mid-market are actually sliding down as well into the, what we think of as the under-50, the small business market. And that's been a nice pickup for us. So our time and attendance online solutions, as well as some of the HR administration but mostly time and attendance, are picking up into the small business. So they're showing up in the 20 to 50, where we were thinking they would be more seen in the 50-plus. Now we have a small in-clock as well, when we purchased the Ikon time systems, a very basic clock, and that's still working the under-10. But we're seeing even better pickup on the SaaS solution for time and attendance over-20, I'd say.\n\n---\n\nYes, I'd say, no, I don't think you can draw any conclusions on mid-market growth rates. And I think that, Tim, what you're seeing is a bit better client base, a bit better pricing, a bit better sales execution, overall, is really kind of driving what's going on in payroll service revenue. In payroll service revenue, we don't include the SaaS products that Marty just mentioned. So time and attendance and HR online administration are reported in HRS. So although we're attaching, you're seeing some of that growth occurring on the HRS side. Now core payroll is -- I should say, payroll is basically payroll services, Taxpay, employee deposit. We're just executing better this year than we were last year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then I guess just given you had another SaaS-based competitor come public, there's another one that's on file that -- I guess, just give us updated comments on the competitive environment as you see it from -- particularly in the, I guess, the small to mid-market right now?\n\n---\n\nYes. I don't see a lot of difference whether they go public or not. Obviously, I don't think it changes a lot. It gives them a little bit of some name out there to get -- going public. But we don't run into them too much. We're still running into mostly the national competitor. They don't -- they're not going to be able to offer as much from the service model perspective across the country. They're not going to offer quite as much on -- from a technology perspective, and it's broad a category from small to midsize, I don't think as we do. So I think we're seeing kind of still the same level of competition. And I think our investments, from a technology standpoint combined with the service, has been particularly strong right now. So I guess, I would say, from one thing, I'm really glad that we invested where we did, starting, I'd say, 4 years ago and really put a lot into the mobility app and the SaaS solutions because they're competing very well, and it's positioned us nicely for the competition that's coming up.  But there are still more regional competitors from that standpoint. Efrain, anything you want to add to that?\n\n---\n\nI'd just say, Tim, that we know them very well. We know them in detail. We know their weaknesses and their strengths. And we take all competition in this space seriously.\n\n---\n\nMarty, you mentioned some very recent enhancements in the mobile and SaaS product areas. Can you perhaps lay out the broader new product roadmap over the next 12, 18 months, what we should expect from an innovation perspective from Paychex?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think the biggest thing is we've talked about it in the past, so I think we're seeing it come to fruition, which is very much a -- exactly what the clients want, which is an integrated experience for the way that we're delivering the entire product. So we started seeing a few years ago that really the mid-market and sometimes even the higher and small market is selling more to an HR or a time and attendance need of the client and then payroll is part of that. And so what we worked on was enhancing products that we either purchased or built over the last 5 -- 4 to 7 years and then enhancing them to integrate the experience, put a revised look to them so that there's a combined -- there's a single sign-on, there's a combined UI, the user experience and user interface for them. And you'll continue to see a more -- I guess, I'll say in that market, you'll continue to see more integration and more UI and additional functionality that is more sophisticated and integrated like job costing and so forth. It's giving them everything and it's -- you're able to update, for example, in the past, we would have issues where you had -- you could update people's -- employees' information in multiple places and sometimes, that was confusing to the client. We now have 1 kind of people section that applies to time and attendance, HR and payroll, and you can update in 1 place that updates everything. And it's a much smoother, seamless approach for the client. And you'll continue to see that integration and usability improve and modernize. In the mobility, like this week, it's making user interface even more modern. And we just released this, the last UI, I would say, 12 to 18 months ago. Now we're releasing kind of an updated UI for the mobility platform. So the changes are going to be more frequent and they're just more modern as we see what the competitive market needs.\n\n---\n\nThat makes sense. Just as a related question, could you update us on the performance of some of your recent acquisitions and new products like ExpenseWire, myStaffing and CashU?\n\n---\n\nYes. myStaffing, extremely strong performance from organic. They sell directly to clients, as well, and there is some indirect partners -- sellers there and direct partnerships. That's selling very well and selling into our base, as well. There's just a huge need for talent, from applicant tracking to talent management and so forth, and doing well. ExpenseWire is performing fine. That's from an expense management. Again, integrating, we're pulling more and more of those acquisitions into the overall mid-market product, so that there's more of a seamless integration along with our time and attendance and HR administration, so that the client has a full suite. And then from a CashU perspective, on the Paychex Accounting Online app, very recent. So we're getting good sign-ups. We're getting a lot of attention. We're kind of learning how to drive more and more of the, not only the sign-up, but then the adoption and actually registering and signing up the client. So we're working with CashU. And then, of course, this -- the private label version, our own, as to how do you drive -- we're doing pretty good driving activity in and then it's how do you get them to register and sign up for the product. But it's very early, so we're kind of learning a lot in that market. But we're happy with it, we like the product, and we're continuing to roll out with them additional enhancements to the Paychex Accounting Online.\n\n---\n\nOn the topic of CashU, Intuit, on its recent quarter reported 95% growth in their payroll-processing business. Are you seeing that at the level of CashU? Is that a little bit above or a little bit below from a client-size perspective?\n\n---\n\nSo you're saying they're seeing a big jump in their payroll -- in the payroll-processing service?\n\n---\n\nRight. I know they're targeted typically at very small businesses that it may be below your average client size. But I'm just wondering if you see them at all in the market from a competitive standpoint?\n\n---\n\nOkay. I think mostly what we -- we'll see them -- SurePayroll will see them. And SurePayroll continues to perform very well. So we've -- that's the other acquisition that we -- we'd talked about it 3 years now. We feel very good about -- SurePayroll continue to have good growth and more even in their direct channel than the indirect channels that they've done a lot of white-labeling with banks and so forth. But even the direct channel is even stronger than we had expected. So we feel real good about their growth and their continued competitiveness against Intuit and others.\n\n---\n\nJust a quick final question. I saw it in your comments about the strength in new business sales in the quarter, you called out every area as being strong except the mid-market. Do I have that correct, or was there another message you were trying to send on mid-market payroll?\n\n---\n\nI think what we've said there, David, was we just called out the ones that were the strongest. We could have called out a number of different sales areas. And we called out the ones that were strongest.\n\n---\n\nI think in the comments, you said that for the 9 months, sales commissions was one of the drivers of growth, but didn't specifically say that, that was a big driver of cost growth this quarter. Should we read into that a change in the trending or growth of new business this quarter versus early in the year, or am I reading too much?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think you're reading too much into it. Actually, sales expenses for the 9 months are up with sales growth for the year. So I think you're reading a little bit too much into it. And we're, by the way, as Marty said, I mean, we've continued to have very solid sales execution for the year and expect that to continue.\n\n---\n\nYes. Okay. The next question, you've talked a lot about new product launches over the last 2 years and, certainly, all the product development investments you've been making. Could you give us a sense, either numbers or sort of anecdotally, how much of those efforts are to upgrade existing offerings that are going in and supporting the same revenue that you've been getting from customers versus driving incremental revenue through new sales or actually being a separate service?\n\n---\n\nYes. I guess I would say, certainly, because when you look at the offering as a complete offering, and we're seeing that more and more come down in the marketplace from people who wanted payroll years ago only and Taxpay and Direct Deposit to, hey, I'd like something for my HR administration and time and attendance, in particular. I think what you'd see is the development has helped -- it's both. It's shored up the existing product base, but it's certainly getting more revenue per client in the addition of the time and attendance offerings. When you look at our product development work, it's been about building mobility, so that clients have more choices to how they get to us and do their payroll. So they have a better online product now and they have much better mobility, I think the best app in the marketplace, for us, from a payroll standpoint and combined service. So those kind of shore up the existing products for what clients expect now from a competitive standpoint. So if we didn't have mobility, for example, I think it would have hurt sales and retention over time, particularly as the 2 national players compete. And some of the regionals can't do as much in that standpoint. Then there's also -- when you take something like time and attendance, we didn't offer as robust a product a few years ago as we do now. And so that's been new revenue streams that have helped the HRS growth in time and attendance, HR administration online, both SaaS products, BeneTrac, the benefit enrollment products that we added there and so forth. So it's a combination of shoring up and keeping it very competitive, and then also adding more products to it.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Great. And then just one more question about the competition. And I totally realize that you grow your revenue in dollar terms more in a year than the size of most of these new upstarts. So looking at the growth rates is unfair. But there just seems to be an awful lot more press, my very unscientific review of banner ads on the web and other things, is just showing a lot more discussion around some of these upstarts. So in light of all that, have you changed the mix or sophistication of how you're marketing and attracting customers, doing leach-in [ph] efforts to compete with what seems like some more brand awareness and probably, somewhat more tech-savvy new entrants trying to come after your market share?\n\n---\n\nYes. A couple of things on that. One, I think one of the positive things about all the press on some of these regional players doing IPOs or partial IPOs, I guess I'd say, is that they bring more awareness to the market of the products. And so, there's a little bit of a plus there for all of us. And then I think when you look at Paychex or another national competitor, hopefully, clients see a much bigger strength there of being around for 40 years and producing consistently solid results, retention service numbers, et cetera. So I think there's actually a little bit of a plus there. And we already had the competition. So it's interesting. From a marketing perspective, we definitely have pushed a lot more on the web. We're picking up a lot more leads from the market search. And that's been a bigger part of our approach. We also have found a much better way to handle those leads. We've evolved into much more real-time handling of the leads themselves that come in. So I think our marketing has picked up some, always can do, I think, more, but it's a balance of where do you spend the money, is it on marketing or on sales, which we kind of put in that category. And we'll always tend to give more on the sales side and put more on our actual execution of the sales team and put more money there for supporting the sales team and their execution. But I think the marketing -- our marketing has picked up. Our website is much stronger. Our whole process of handling the leads is stronger, and I guess that's how I'd look at it. And I appreciate that you do talk about looking at absolute numbers of growth, as opposed to percentages because that certainly means a lot to us. The amount of growth of what 5% to 6% means for us is a lot bigger than sometimes the entire company that someone else might be looking at.\n\n---\n\nAnd, Gary, one other thing I'd add to what Marty said, we don't talk a lot about the efforts that support sales. But we have an entire organization where we've made significant investments on national sales support office here, both in terms of technology and numbers of people. And I would say, I would put our ability to both generate and convert leads up against anyone. We can put a person, feet on the street within hours of getting a web lead, which I don't think many people can do. And we also have both SurePayroll, as I mentioned to some of you, SurePayroll and our core sales competing, we let them compete head-to-head in terms of web sales leads. So we don't feel like we're missing anything that's occurring in the market. We just don't toot our horn with respect to that, either. I think to be in this game long term, not short term, but to be in it long term, you have to have a compelling service proposition and a compelling technology position. And what we've been doing is we've been improving both. Some people in the competition have not been doing that. We think long term, the right solution that works is the one that combines -- that creates a sustainable advantage by maximizing both, not just one.\n\n---\n\nA question about checks per payroll trends and the 1% growth in the quarter. I know that your comparison was more difficult and you'd highlighted that it would slow. But I'm just wondering what you'd expect going forward and if there's any potential mix impact on that?\n\n---\n\nThere's a little bit of mix impact always. Just to kind of refresh recollection, we're not doing a same-store comparison. We do a little bit of validation to make sure it's not too wacky but it's not a same-store comparison. We're just taking the amount of checks we admitted and comparing them to a prior period. So you get some mix effect in there. I think, Sara, what happened, we had a pretty strong Q3 last year. There was some Sandy overhang, there were bonuses in there we think that may have affected that number. Now we're normalizing down in the -- I would say that we're down in the 1%, 1.5% range. That's what we've seen during the year. Our assumption is that will continue to moderate. But we'll see, we haven't called it precisely correctly. So you're going to get some variability there. And our expectation is we're -- one, we'll be probably moderating slightly down from there.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then separately, could you talk a bit more about the new payment-processing service with Elavon? And I'm wondering how that fits into the chain of client acquisition since I generally think of clients signing up for credit card processing first and then maybe adding on payroll solutions after that.\n\n---\n\nWell, I think -- Sara, you're right. I think when we went into this and we started trialing it, we really kind of looked at that we're getting in pretty early on a new business and that we had -- because we had feet on the street, we would get to the new businesses as they started up and would be successful in signing them up for the first time. And what we found in trialing it in a number of zones around the country was that wasn't always the case and that -- so we actually changed the sales model around and we sell more of that now basically over the phone and into the client base and we're having more success there. And so what we found is it's kind of its own animal. So if you -- you have to know the pricing, you have to know how to price it per transaction, the different kinds of businesses. And what we found was a little bit more of a specialized team over the phone and concentrated could sell into the client base more successfully than 1,200 reps going at brand-new clients the first time. So we trialed that around, found the best way we think to sell it and now we've kind of officially introduced it. And we're just starting to get some traction and results on it but we're definitely starting to get some traction. So we feel with over 500,000 clients and under that on the small business side that we've got a nice opportunity there. Elavon, obviously -- so what we're doing is setting it up. We're getting to the client base who have the strength of knowing the Paychex brand and knowing that they already use us for money flow and so forth. And that by trusting us that they'll sign up with us with competitive packages and all the solutions that Elavon brings and then we get a piece of that action on a go-forward basis.\n\n---\n\nBack when you used to report HR client service employees on a sequential basis, you sometimes had a more moderate growth over year end, given the high attrition. It looks like you had a really good quarter. Does that mean you actually had pretty good client employee growth over year end this year?\n\n---\n\nI think we had good growth over year end. But I think, Jim, we just really have had strong sales in HR Services overall. It's been a good sales year from that perspective.\n\n---\n\nAnd does the processing day impact next quarter? You said that HR Services wouldn't be at the low end next quarter of growth rate. Is that affected by processing day or is it something else there?\n\n---\n\nNo, there's a little bit of impact on there. But I also called out, we had a very, very strong quarter in terms of HR Solutions. And look, we'd love to have every single quarter look like that. But at this point, we don't think that will repeat quite to the extent it did this quarter.\n\n---\n\nAnd just one final sort of technical question. So last quarter, your SG&A sort of jumped a bunch. And this quarter, it was -- didn't -- wasn't -- the increase wasn't very much at all. Anything going on there that I should know about?\n\n---\n\nNot really. What ends up happening -- what's ending up happening in SG&A is that we are adjusting as we go through the year variable elements of comps. Sometimes we get it right, sometimes we overshoot a little bit. And we developed a view of kind of how it's going to project quarter-over-quarter. I would say in terms of the year, we think it will be pretty close to what we expected to plan, maybe it shifted a little bit from one quarter to another. And then rate of IT spending also has an impact on that. So it can shift a little bit but it's not dramatically beyond what we expected when we started the year.\n\n---\n\nThis is Ryan calling in for George. I have -- the first question about the selling season. It sounds like you guys had some positive comments around it. Is it surrounding like the overall selling environment being better or is it maybe a product of market share gains or a combination of the 2?\n\n---\n\nI think -- well, I think the overall environment is okay. I think it's still -- we would say from a new business start, one way to gauge it, is it's still fairly sluggish. I think new business starts are up a bit, but it's nothing to kind of write home about. It's not back to prerecession levels yet that we've seen. Employment is up a little when we look at checks per payroll and so forth. So I think it's just kind of continued good execution on the sales side more than the environment has suddenly swelled or anything. I think we've seen some positive in the environment but it hasn't been anything to be overly excited about. We see kind of a steady improvement in the small business environment. Efrain, anything you want to add? And as I think I said, the execution has been consistent and good there. So I think it's been just as much that, more that than the environment itself.\n\n---\n\nYes, I agree with that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Okay, fair enough. Now focusing in on the margins x -- they've been on a nice upward trajectory over the last several years. Is there a point where it kind of takes a breather given commentary, I guess, of accelerating new sales growth '14 over '13 and some of the acquisitions and immigration costs? Is it fair to assume the margin could take a breather?\n\n---\n\nI think we'll talk more about that when we get to the fourth quarter and talk about plans. The rate and the extent of leverage is a function in part of top line growth. So as we grow top line more, we get more ability to leverage. So we have to go through the plan and look at it. I would just say what I say to everyone on this point, which is that when we go into a plan, we look at trying to get leverage. And when we get the leverage, we try to beat it during the year. So that's what you see.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just one quick model-making question. Sorry to do this, but it looked like there is a negative swing in the net change in funds held for clients off the cash flow and balance, pretty significant. I guess, what is that from?\n\n---\n\nNot sure what exactly you're pointing to.\n\n---\n\nSo year-over-year, it looks like there's $1.4 billion negative change in funds held for clients?\n\n---\n\nOh, I'm sorry. Yes. I would urge you to really think about average funds held for clients. It really is very dependent on when a particular quarter closes, how much we have in funds, how much we've disbursed on that day or that quarter. On average, if you look at our Q -- I think the 9 months, we call out the balance -- the average balance is $3.7 billion. So that's really what you need to focus on, we're up about 5% for the 9-month period. Quarter to quarter, it can really, really swing and it's really a function of when the quarter ended, what funds we were holding, what payments needed to be made.\n\n---\n\nI guess my first question is with regards to the impact of new partner products that you introduced and some of this you covered, but there's been a range, payments, accounting, payroll cards, the new announcement recently. What is the revenue implication in terms of ramping revenues off that? And also, given they're partner products as opposed to your own products, how does that work with regards to margins and split of economics?\n\n---\n\nWell, obviously, we wouldn't give too much detail on it from a competitive standpoint what we're doing with the partners exactly. But it's pretty small to begin with. What we think that there's a nice value-added advantage we have of getting into the client base and we've decided instead of -- certain things like payment processing, instead of going out and acquiring a global payments processor or a regional payments processor was better to just get a commission on the sales there on the ongoing transactions. And so it's positive, but it's going to be pretty small compared to our overall revenue. We certainly hope it will grow with the client base as we penetrate the client base more, but it's a little bit early to tell. When you look at the accounting, remember that there's -- that's a partnership with kind of an investment in CashU and then labeling our own products. So a piece of that, it will be pretty small for a while until we start converting clients and getting them to register. And then over time, we may make a bigger investment there and then it starts to show up as a bigger impact on our revenue stream. So again, these tend to be small longer-term investments that we think have a great opportunity to become significant but over the longer period of time.\n\n---\n\nThe other thing, Ashwin, I'd say, just to echo what Marty said, it is a longer-term play. But in the shorter term, what we know is that the more products a client has, the stickier they are. So that's part of what we're trying to do, is build multiple touch points with the client so that they are stickier within the base.\n\n---\n\nRight. Right, understood. With regards to one of the product lines that you have for some time now, health care, how big is it? And with regards to ACA being, I guess, for the small business segment below 100 being pushed out by maybe a year, is that affecting growth in the segment or are people looking forward and saying this is something they need to do?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think -- from a size perspective, I think we publicly said the agency is over $100 million in revenue and that we have over 100,000 clients and -- as are for insurance agency. And I think specific to the health piece of it, it is, as I mentioned earlier, has moderated a bit because I think clients -- it's been a good opportunity for us to get in front of clients and support them with the products that we've already rolled out, which help them decide. There's tools there as to whether kind of monthly reporting and monitoring services, whether it applies to them or not. But I think all the confusion and the delays of now the 50 to 100 don't have to have insurance for their employees in '15, 2015. I think all that has moderated the sales of some of the products in the short term. I do think as you approach the fall and people start looking at their annual premiums going up, I think they will -- we'll be well positioned to offer them options and expertise to combine both -- because we offer that payroll company all the other solutions that we have, added services and an insurance agency. I think it will position us well. But it kind of pushed it out a bit as the rules have been -- and the requirements have pushed out.\n\n---\n\nRight. And just so I understand, are these the people that your sales force that were selling it, was it a specialized sales force and does it now have to be refocused on other things or is it more fungible than that?\n\n---\n\nNo. It's a specialized sales force on the health and benefit side and the workers' comp insurance and other insurances side. We are a full-service agency. They're a specific sales force that are licensed and sell those products in the field and over the phone. And they're still out selling. And there's good execution there. It's just not quite as a big of an increase as we expected. We think it's more moderate but it will continue to -- it's continuing to grow, that's for sure.\n\n---\n\nOkay. My last question is with regards to the index that you introduced. How much of that is more of a branding exercise versus is there a lack of information in the public domain today that you will focus on bringing out? What sort of information is there at [indiscernible] and public domain?\n\n---\n\nYes. There's a -- I mean, there's a number of indexes out there. But I think we felt -- and we've talked about this for a number of years internally about whether to do it or not. We think that we're kind of uniquely positioned because the one thing that we keep getting asked is more -- looking for more real-time data on small business grow. And we're taking basically a subset of our overall client base of 350,000 of the clients under 50 and creating an index that same-store sale -- same-store that kind of shows year-over-year what the worker growth is for those clients. And I -- well, the conclusion we came to was we have some unique data here. Typically, you would get that kind of data from federal indexes that are -- or federal sources that are kind of lagged 3 quarters and that we were getting the push for, hey, how about some real-time data from some of your clients. So we felt that we had something unique here. It's real time, it focuses on under 50. And I think we have some of the best data in the business. And so we produced an index that we think will add something a little bit different to the marketplace.\n\n---\n\nJust a couple of quick questions on pricing. You talk about offering a bundle of the core payroll products with some online solutions. What does the pricing look like there? Is there a higher revenue per client solution? Or does it fall somewhere between the core product or just the pure SaaS product?\n\n---\n\nNo. It's really -- when you don't count SurePayroll in there, if you look at just the Paychex offerings, there's no real difference. It's a complete offering for the small business under 50. You're looking at a complete offering with both online and that's part of the full suite. You're getting full service, dedicated service, and you have the online and mobility. It's all part of shoring up that product. The good news that we've seen is we're continuing to grow the revenue per client, as we've said. And we think that that's been part of higher retention and better -- new business revenue being higher. So a stronger -- I guess a stronger offering that is driving up the revenue per client. And again, we've said that the price increases are holding as well. So we think that's all part of a complete offering. When you look at SurePayroll, it's a different offering. It's roughly a third typically in an average client that we see and we've said that. And that's continuing to hold up very well on a price perspective as well.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And on the HRS side, you mentioned that in the release that you're getting higher average premiums in workers' comp. Does that -- is that going to translate into higher expected claims cost or is it all pass through?\n\n---\n\nNo. That's just an underlying rate that we've negotiated with carriers. It really doesn't have to do -- and on workers' comp, by the way, that's, at least within our agency, that's brokered business. So we're not taking any risk on that portion of business.\n\n---\n\nI know it's late, I'll just ask one quick one. Efrain, on the guidance and looking at the operating margin, I know you said 38% could be 38.5%. But even at that level, it does imply some margin contraction for the fourth quarter. Is my math correct? Is there something going on that we should know about?\n\n---\n\nWell, you're right. You're right, Jeff. And if you look at every fourth quarter, kind of going back probably 3 years, you see we have pretty significant contraction in the quarter. And it's just a higher spend quarter in general. And part of that just to get kind of one level deeper is that IT spending typically has been going up double digits, this year is no exception. And that ramps through the year so that we exit the year at higher spending. And then there's other sales-related expenses that occur in that quarter that typically kind of burden that margin a bit more.\n\n---\n\nBut would that still imply margin contraction on a year-over-year basis compared to the fourth quarter last year?\n\n---\n\nI haven't looked at the quarter-over-quarter. I'm just sticking to guidance. It shouldn't, Jeff. Even if we're between 38% and 39%, it -- we should be a little bit better. I have to look at it specifically.\n\n---\n\nI just want to ask about retention. I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you give any color around what retention looked like in the quarter versus [indiscernible]?\n\n---\n\nTien-tsin, we just said it continued to be very strong. I think we're still looking at approximately the highest levels of retention we've had in our -- in history, certainly 5 to 6 years. So we still feel very good about the client retention that we're seeing in the client base.\n\n---\n\nAll right, that's good to know. And then just -- I know you had a lot of questions, not surprisingly, about SaaS and some of the changes going on in the public marketplace. But just -- can you just give us a quick high-level thumbnail sketch on just right now, today, point solutions versus service bureau, sort of given all this stuff that's going on in the world with ACA, what have you. What are you seeing on the ground in terms of preference between the 2 sides because I know there can be some push and pull at different periods of the cycle.\n\n---\n\nYes. Not seeing any drastic change. I think we've continued because of the investments we've made and what we've rolled out. We feel good about the SaaS offerings that we have, both small market and large, that we're well positioned on the perspective from the offerings, from small business to mid-market, the time and attendance, the HR administration, the benefit enrollment, all real SaaS solutions. But our focus has been very much offering the combination of that with the service. That's what folks are not seeing as much when they're -- usually when they're going somewhere else. We're still trying to give you that dedicated model and focusing that you have all the technology, you have all the SaaS and cloud-based solution that you want, all online now. There isn't -- we're not selling software that you're putting on your system and haven't been really for some time. It's all SaaS based. And everything is becoming more and more integrated across the product set. So we feel very well positioned there. So even with all the hype, we probably, as I think Efrain mentioned earlier, we don't hype that as much. And people look at us more as a service bureau. But we're very much a SaaS-based with a service model is how we look at it.\n\n---\n\nYes, that makes perfect sense. Just lastly and I'll let you go. Just the PEO stuff, a lot of good commentary there. Are you making some incremental investments in the PEO, given some of the commentary around pickup in demand?\n\n---\n\nYes. What we did previously, probably last year, they went more to the SaaS model, the new online Paychex Next Gen product. And so I think what we're seeing is that paid off -- that's been paying off very nicely because not only did we always have good service in the PEO model but as the PEO kind of became more in favor, back in favor in the marketplace, we were really well positioned to execute on the sales side, not only for the need but because we have the technology and the service level.\n\n---\n\nOne strategic question. Just as we continue to see an expansion in terms of the solution set, how are you thinking about build versus buy versus alliances as you optimize your solution set? Just -- you've had a couple of experiences. Just how are you thinking about that?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think -- we look at that a lot. It's always -- we're very proud of the investments that we've made and that we're feeling good about them paying off as we kind of talked about through the call. But we're always on an eye to a year out, 2 years out, 3 years out and how well positioned are we in the various markets. And we're very open to build or partner and we're always kind of looking pretty closely at that. We think we have a tremendous distribution model still. Our field sales team, close to 3,000 salespeople in the field have continued to execute. And so it's all about how fast can we give them more to sell and what's the best way to do that. And obviously, you've seen on kind of the smaller end, when we look at payment processing, we think there's an opportunity there, we partner. When we look at a new product like Accounting Online, we partner. If we think that in various markets, we're better off partnering, we'll look at the economics of that and the opportunity to grow and we're very open to it.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then with regards to some of the sales initiatives that you put in place, such as going after franchisees, can you just give us a little bit of a sense for what areas have seen the strongest results in terms of the initiatives that you laid out at your analyst meeting?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think, one, the banking channel for us has been something that in the past, we were much stronger on the CPA channel, not as strong on the banks. I think that Mark Bottini and the team there, building a team that really dedicated more focus on the banks and the support of the bank channel has led to a number of referrals and sales there. And we've seen that. We think that's been very successful, particularly in certain markets. And because we just focus better, that was one of the initiatives the franchise has picked up as well. I would say even more successful in signing up the franchises. And now we're kind of learning how best to service those franchises. So there is connection to Subway, there's connections to the Yum! brands, there's connection there. Now we're learning who has more kind of clout in those organizations because you're still not -- you're not requiring them to sign up with you but you're driving influence from the headquarters type of thing. And so we're learning a lot how best to partner with the headquarters and with the franchisees. But we're -- that's something we continue to invest in. And I think that team has been very successful in building the relationships and signing up new franchisees from a corporate standpoint. And now we just got to pick up the pace on closing those franchisees. And we're finding different ways to sell into the market once we have the agreements as well. So the initiatives on banks, franchisees and so forth, we feel they are doing good, they're picking up momentum. And so we're feeling pretty good about it.\n\n---\n\nThat's great. And then one last question with regards to the expense performance this quarter. I mean, it was basically isolated to the other line. What are some of the areas that just fluctuate within that?\n\n---\n\nThe other line?\n\n---\n\nYes. So when we go through the Q, as an example, there's -- you break out expenses between wages and compensation, other.\n\n---\n\nYes. You're looking at it by natural categories. I think -- yes, I'd say that our P&L is variable. And we have a fair amount of ability to manage expenses intraquarter. And obviously, based on what we're seeing in the year, we can make adjustments as we go forward. So there's nothing unusual popping out in that category. We have higher IT expenses. And we did a really good job on operating expenses, controlling that growth as the financial statements indicate. So there's nothing strange going on there.\n\n---\n\nI was just wondering if you could keep that up.\n\n---\n\nYou know what? Look, if you ignore the natural category expense breakdown, then look at what we're doing, step back a bit, what we're doing is we're leveraging operating costs and we're investing -- continuing to invest in IT. So SG&A growing faster than sales, primarily driven by IT and ops expense is growing slower than sales. That trend, that macro trend, irrespective of where it falls from a natural expense category standpoint, is a trend that we expect to continue.\n\n---\n\nThis is Ashish Sabadra on behalf of Bryan. Most of my questions have been answered. Just a quick one on the CPA channel. I was just wondering if you could provide a quick update on that one.\n\n---\n\nYes. That continues to be good for us, pretty solid across-the-board. We maintain those good relationships. And I think the only thing that is -- would moderate that some is just the new business growth, as we've said, continues to be a bit sluggish. And a lot of the new business referrals came from the CPAs. So that has probably tamped that down a little bit. But the relationships and the approach for the CPAs and our referrals from them continue to be okay.\n\n---\n\nGreat, great. And just one more quick question on the partnership model. Is there an opportunity for you to partner with other technology vendors and provide services on top of it? These could be into a segment where you have not currently tapped them, could be much more the big midtier clients or other HR solutions that you currently don't have in your portfolio? I was just wondering if you could just comment on that.\n\n---\n\nYes. We're always -- I may have mentioned earlier, we're always open to that. We think we're not going to go too far flung from what we do but in providing strength to the employer-employee relationship, and if there's a technology lead or a market that we think we can be very successful in and leverage the great 3,000 salespeople that we have out there that execute well and we can bring them something else, we would certainly be open to that versus building. It's always a matter of looking at the economics of that and certainly, what we think is our level of success. So we're certainly open to it and always looking at those alternatives.\n\n---\n\nSo just 2 quick ones, hopefully they're quick, but how do you measure the progress of the technology upgrades? In other words, I'm wondering, do you measure that per usage and if there's any color? If not, that's fine. And then just one quick follow-up.\n\n---\n\nYes. I wouldn't say as much on usage at this point as it is the selling. So are we selling it, are we competitive. And again with good continued sales execution, we feel good about that and increased penetration. So we're seeing increased attachment and increased penetration in those SaaS solutions. So we feel that that's a good marker for us. And then certainly, retention, and we see good retention of the products that we're rolling out from a technical standpoint. And so we closely monitor that. We look at obviously all the surveys that we're doing on top of that and are constantly tweaking and changing to keep competitive. So I think that it's more of a measurement of that than usage necessarily of the product itself.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then secondly, it sounds like the business is better after sort of slogging away at it for quite some time here. Yet the traditional catalysts like small business starts haven't necessarily picked up. Should we start thinking about that differently? Are there -- are you finding new catalysts within the business that can pick up the slack even though we haven't seen the traditional ones pick up steam?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think that's fair. I mean, we still have a good percentage of our business -- sales that come from new businesses. And while that's sluggish, it certainly is up from where it was last year. It's not back to prerecession levels. So I do think -- I don't want to mislead you and think that new business still isn't a strong part of our business. We're still very good at that and get referrals from CPAs on new business and banks and so forth. But I do think that we -- knowing that we were -- that, that continued to be kind of sluggish coming back, we look for new ways to attract, to get referrals. We look at new ways to retain clients. We look at new products and investing a lot of the technology investment has been that -- we also, I think, have gotten -- have done a nice job in building the revenue per client. And so we're thinking even getting better at saying, hey, we've got a lot of product here to sell into the client base. And we're not going to wait around for the economy to be superstrong. Let's just sell into the client base, as well as bring in new clients. And I think maybe that mix is changing a little bit. Efrain, anything you want to add?\n\n---\n\nI'd agree, Joe. So I think that the execution you're seeing is a result of our ability to extract value from the distribution base we've got and there's a long way -- we've got a long way to go in that process.\n\n---\n\nI think we've also found new ways to refine it. So if you take like our initiatives on 401(k), we always sold into the small market, what we would say small market for 401(k) very successful. And -- but we started looking at how do we increase that over what we've always been doing. And we found a way to go into the large market, larger assets for clients and we really sent -- built a sales team just focused on that, built a team, small team focused on financial advisors and getting more leads from them. So we're not just going the traditional route. We've really worked hard to find new ways to grow what we've always been good at.\n\n---\n\nSorry, I'm late here. I actually got on the call late so if this has been answered, we can take this offline. But just really quickly, I had a quick question about the exchanges. What -- where are you -- I know you had announced a partnership with one of the small business exchanges. Just kind of wondering where you are in that process and what impact you expect the exchanges to have on your business, both near term as well as out 2 to 3 years based on what you know right now?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think Evolution1 was the partner we were in with. And we have that set up. And we're not -- one of the things that we were trying to do there was help businesses, small businesses who are under pressure to give to -- who don't have to do small business group insurance, small group insurance but want to provide something to their clients, to do some pretax and then go over to the private exchange and use that. Unfortunately, some of the changes in the health care reform kind of took away that benefit, at least at this point, for pretax benefit. So if I'm a small group employer and I want to just give $300 a month to my employee pretax, that's not really necessarily an alternative anymore that it's going to be pretax and so forth. So it slowed kind of that whole thing for us on the private exchange piece. We still have the partnership, we still offer it. It's just not quite as attractive as it was previously. And that may still change, as these rules kind of solidify over the next year or so. But I do -- and then the exchanges in general, we have not seen as much of a loss, I would say, to the exchanges yet that we thought we might see on the small business side. And we haven't -- we've seen the sales to those who need insurance, we've seen that moderated, as I mentioned earlier. Just -- we haven't seen as much of a decision-making process from the clients because they're kind of confused and they realize that like the 50 to 100 don't have to do anything now in 2015, they have until 2016. So I'd say, overall, the whole exchange piece hasn't caused any major disruption. It also hasn't accelerated anything. It's been a more moderate kind of thing. And we expect we'll see more of the opportunity and maybe the impact in the next fiscal year as they approach 2000 -- really '16 will be the bigger impact.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Thank you. And at this point, we'll close the meeting. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately a month until April 28. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our third quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great day.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Jason Kupferberg (Analysts)】\nCan you just give us a sense of, now that the key selling season is over, how your sales force did relative to the quotas that they had during the key selling season? And are you still expecting to be, or I should say, where are you expecting to be in kind of your 1% to 3% target range for organic client growth this year, now that you did get through the key selling season? I'm guessing you've got some better visibility on where you might land in that range?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I don't -- Jason, it's Marty. We don't -- actually, we don't give the client growth number until the end of the year, as you know, because we want to get through the whole year. But I would say on -- from the sales execution in selling season, continued solid performance there, so particularly in the HRS side, in core payroll and HR small business and in the HRS side, particularly in the PEO. As we've said in some comments, we feel really strong, and the PEO came in really strong in year. And I think that's health care reform, I think that's just a real resurgence there, and that's been good. But really, overall, a very -- continued solid execution from a sales perspective.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nAnd Jason, just to add to what Marty said, we don't give the specifics, but we feel very comfortable that we're within that range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Kupferberg (Analysts)】\nOkay. That's helpful. And I think in the past, over the last several quarters or so, when you guys have asked -- have been asked where pricing is running in core payroll, it seems like you've indicated it's been closer to the lower end of that longer-term 2% to 4% range that you had laid out at the analyst meeting a couple of years ago. Was that the case again during this quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. We're still feeling good retention from a client base and from a revenue -- I guess, I'd say, capture perspective. We feel good about holding the price increase that we did last year. And I would think we never really changed that range going forward. And we wouldn't want to get any more specific than that coming up.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Kupferberg (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just last question. I think you mentioned some good traction on the SaaS side of the business. Can you give us any sense just in terms of mix of new sales, how you've seen that shift? Presumably, the SaaS mix there has been increasing, but any numbers you could give us just to help convey how much demand you've seen for SaaS, perhaps relative to the classic full-service outsourced model?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, it's an interesting mix. I'll give you a comment and then let Efrain pick up, as well. But it's -- our model is, we're giving -- over the last few years with all the technology investment and what we've rolled out, we see a much bigger impact of clients moving to the online apps, but it's with our service tied into it. So what we like -- the way we positioned this was deliberately to say, hey, you have a dedicated person, they're available to you, but we have a much more robust online payroll, time and attendance, HR administration solutions for you, as well. So if you want to do it online through the SaaS solution, you can do that. If you want support and use your dedicated person, you can do that. And what we're really starting to see is very much what we hoped, which was a mix of both using the solution. And so many more online clients signing up for online, but then using their serviceperson as well when they need to. So this week, I may put in my own online payroll. I may call for something I need, but I'm putting it in myself. The next week, I may go to the payroll specialist. But we're seeing the biggest push -- online has continued to grow very much. But the biggest push also has been in the time and attendance, and HR solutions, the administration, that are SaaS products online. And we're seeing, across both small and mid-market, some growth in those products that's picking up in penetration in sales. So I wouldn't give exact numbers, but we're certainly seeing a better penetration rate on the new sales, our attachment rate and a better penetration, overall, into the customer base.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nJason, just to add to what Marty said, when we say SaaS products, we're talking about a suite of products that not only includes core payroll, but includes things like time and attendance, HR administration online. Those are doing very, very well for us. And they are both sold to our core base and also to our -- in the mid-market space. With respect to the low end, the microenterprise-space SaaS, it's doing very well. It's continued to do well. That part of the market -- the low-end SaaS is very attractive to that portion of the market, and SurePayroll plays very, very effectively there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nEfrain, you said client growth, you don't want to give out client growth numbers, but you're comfortable within the range you've set. Is there a difference you're witnessing between maybe the SurePayroll type of client versus what I would consider your traditional Paychex type of client in terms of net client growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nSo we look at both, and I think we are satisfied with the performance of both segments of the market. So I think, Kartik, the answer to your question is that we see growth on the low end and we've seen growth in our core client base, also.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nAnd then, Efrain, you had what I consider a very good margin quarter. It seems like good growth year-over-year. Anything specific as to why margins were really strong this quarter, or is it that just 1 extra day and maybe just management of the expenses? Was there anything else in terms of sales or sales execution or commission that might have impacted that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI think, Kartik, it really -- our model is -- has a significant component of variable expenses associated with it. And when we deliver strong top line growth, the marginal expenses associated with that top line are relatively small. And I think what you see in the model is that when we have strong revenue quarters like we did this quarter, a lot of it flows to the bottom line. And that's the way the model is built. So the more top line growth we deliver, the better leverage we see. Well, I guess I'd characterize it that way. We did -- and in other words, we didn't -- we did everything we were thinking of doing in the quarter from an expense standpoint. There was nothing unusual about our spending pattern.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nAnd then just one last question, Marty. Have you seen any change or difference in terms of what's happening with your health care insurance business? I know at the beginning of the year, you thought there might be some impact there because of the Affordable Health Care Act. And I'm wondering because of all the changes that are happening or the delays that have been announced, if that's impacted the business any differently than what you had anticipated?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. I think it certainly has moderated it a bit. I think that what we're finding, as I mentioned in the comments, Kartik, was kind of a lack of decision-making on some parts of the -- of small business and really midsize business because the rules keep changing. And so I think the employers are not sure what to do exactly. So I think that has slowed a little bit from what we had expected or hoped for. The good news is the products are out there, and the products that we've rolled out, giving the tools to the employer, are very hopeful. There's a -- we're finding a lot of confusion from the small business and midsize business space and we're able to help them. So the good news is it's continuing to get us -- our reps in front of them with different products. I guess, I'd say, the moderate news is that they're not buying as much insurance because they're not sure if now it's been pushed off a little bit. And I think you might see that pick up more in toward -- into the summer and the fall as they look at benefit plans and start to see some -- could be some healthy premium increases, and they may look for alternatives from folks like our insurance agency who can give them those tools.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy McHugh (Analysts)】\nI just wanted to ask, you've talked about seeing in the payroll growth I guess better attach rates. Can you -- what is -- I guess what solutions are included within the payroll services growth that you're attaching? And I guess the follow-on or associated question also is, can we look at the revenue per client growth that's helping payroll growth, partly reflecting that you're seeing faster growth within the mid-market necessarily than with smaller clients at this point? Or is that not a good conclusion to draw from the data?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nNo. I'll start on the product and then let Efrain take that last part. I think, Tim, primarily, what we're seeing is time and attendance solutions picking up, and from a SaaS product standpoint anyway, we're seeing time and attendance solutions that we would have felt were more mid-market are actually sliding down as well into the, what we think of as the under-50, the small business market. And that's been a nice pickup for us. So our time and attendance online solutions, as well as some of the HR administration but mostly time and attendance, are picking up into the small business. So they're showing up in the 20 to 50, where we were thinking they would be more seen in the 50-plus. Now we have a small in-clock as well, when we purchased the Ikon time systems, a very basic clock, and that's still working the under-10. But we're seeing even better pickup on the SaaS solution for time and attendance over-20, I'd say.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, I'd say, no, I don't think you can draw any conclusions on mid-market growth rates. And I think that, Tim, what you're seeing is a bit better client base, a bit better pricing, a bit better sales execution, overall, is really kind of driving what's going on in payroll service revenue. In payroll service revenue, we don't include the SaaS products that Marty just mentioned. So time and attendance and HR online administration are reported in HRS. So although we're attaching, you're seeing some of that growth occurring on the HRS side. Now core payroll is -- I should say, payroll is basically payroll services, Taxpay, employee deposit. We're just executing better this year than we were last year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy McHugh (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then I guess just given you had another SaaS-based competitor come public, there's another one that's on file that -- I guess, just give us updated comments on the competitive environment as you see it from -- particularly in the, I guess, the small to mid-market right now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. I don't see a lot of difference whether they go public or not. Obviously, I don't think it changes a lot. It gives them a little bit of some name out there to get -- going public. But we don't run into them too much. We're still running into mostly the national competitor. They don't -- they're not going to be able to offer as much from the service model perspective across the country. They're not going to offer quite as much on -- from a technology perspective, and it's broad a category from small to midsize, I don't think as we do. So I think we're seeing kind of still the same level of competition. And I think our investments, from a technology standpoint combined with the service, has been particularly strong right now. So I guess, I would say, from one thing, I'm really glad that we invested where we did, starting, I'd say, 4 years ago and really put a lot into the mobility app and the SaaS solutions because they're competing very well, and it's positioned us nicely for the competition that's coming up.  But there are still more regional competitors from that standpoint. Efrain, anything you want to add to that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI'd just say, Tim, that we know them very well. We know them in detail. We know their weaknesses and their strengths. And we take all competition in this space seriously.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Togut (Analysts)】\nMarty, you mentioned some very recent enhancements in the mobile and SaaS product areas. Can you perhaps lay out the broader new product roadmap over the next 12, 18 months, what we should expect from an innovation perspective from Paychex?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think the biggest thing is we've talked about it in the past, so I think we're seeing it come to fruition, which is very much a -- exactly what the clients want, which is an integrated experience for the way that we're delivering the entire product. So we started seeing a few years ago that really the mid-market and sometimes even the higher and small market is selling more to an HR or a time and attendance need of the client and then payroll is part of that. And so what we worked on was enhancing products that we either purchased or built over the last 5 -- 4 to 7 years and then enhancing them to integrate the experience, put a revised look to them so that there's a combined -- there's a single sign-on, there's a combined UI, the user experience and user interface for them. And you'll continue to see a more -- I guess, I'll say in that market, you'll continue to see more integration and more UI and additional functionality that is more sophisticated and integrated like job costing and so forth. It's giving them everything and it's -- you're able to update, for example, in the past, we would have issues where you had -- you could update people's -- employees' information in multiple places and sometimes, that was confusing to the client. We now have 1 kind of people section that applies to time and attendance, HR and payroll, and you can update in 1 place that updates everything. And it's a much smoother, seamless approach for the client. And you'll continue to see that integration and usability improve and modernize. In the mobility, like this week, it's making user interface even more modern. And we just released this, the last UI, I would say, 12 to 18 months ago. Now we're releasing kind of an updated UI for the mobility platform. So the changes are going to be more frequent and they're just more modern as we see what the competitive market needs.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Togut (Analysts)】\nThat makes sense. Just as a related question, could you update us on the performance of some of your recent acquisitions and new products like ExpenseWire, myStaffing and CashU?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. myStaffing, extremely strong performance from organic. They sell directly to clients, as well, and there is some indirect partners -- sellers there and direct partnerships. That's selling very well and selling into our base, as well. There's just a huge need for talent, from applicant tracking to talent management and so forth, and doing well. ExpenseWire is performing fine. That's from an expense management. Again, integrating, we're pulling more and more of those acquisitions into the overall mid-market product, so that there's more of a seamless integration along with our time and attendance and HR administration, so that the client has a full suite. And then from a CashU perspective, on the Paychex Accounting Online app, very recent. So we're getting good sign-ups. We're getting a lot of attention. We're kind of learning how to drive more and more of the, not only the sign-up, but then the adoption and actually registering and signing up the client. So we're working with CashU. And then, of course, this -- the private label version, our own, as to how do you drive -- we're doing pretty good driving activity in and then it's how do you get them to register and sign up for the product. But it's very early, so we're kind of learning a lot in that market. But we're happy with it, we like the product, and we're continuing to roll out with them additional enhancements to the Paychex Accounting Online.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Togut (Analysts)】\nOn the topic of CashU, Intuit, on its recent quarter reported 95% growth in their payroll-processing business. Are you seeing that at the level of CashU? Is that a little bit above or a little bit below from a client-size perspective?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nSo you're saying they're seeing a big jump in their payroll -- in the payroll-processing service?\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Togut (Analysts)】\nRight. I know they're targeted typically at very small businesses that it may be below your average client size. But I'm just wondering if you see them at all in the market from a competitive standpoint?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nOkay. I think mostly what we -- we'll see them -- SurePayroll will see them. And SurePayroll continues to perform very well. So we've -- that's the other acquisition that we -- we'd talked about it 3 years now. We feel very good about -- SurePayroll continue to have good growth and more even in their direct channel than the indirect channels that they've done a lot of white-labeling with banks and so forth. But even the direct channel is even stronger than we had expected. So we feel real good about their growth and their continued competitiveness against Intuit and others.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Togut (Analysts)】\nJust a quick final question. I saw it in your comments about the strength in new business sales in the quarter, you called out every area as being strong except the mid-market. Do I have that correct, or was there another message you were trying to send on mid-market payroll?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI think what we've said there, David, was we just called out the ones that were the strongest. We could have called out a number of different sales areas. And we called out the ones that were strongest.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gary Bisbee (Analysts)】\nI think in the comments, you said that for the 9 months, sales commissions was one of the drivers of growth, but didn't specifically say that, that was a big driver of cost growth this quarter. Should we read into that a change in the trending or growth of new business this quarter versus early in the year, or am I reading too much?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, I think you're reading too much into it. Actually, sales expenses for the 9 months are up with sales growth for the year. So I think you're reading a little bit too much into it. And we're, by the way, as Marty said, I mean, we've continued to have very solid sales execution for the year and expect that to continue.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gary Bisbee (Analysts)】\nYes. Okay. The next question, you've talked a lot about new product launches over the last 2 years and, certainly, all the product development investments you've been making. Could you give us a sense, either numbers or sort of anecdotally, how much of those efforts are to upgrade existing offerings that are going in and supporting the same revenue that you've been getting from customers versus driving incremental revenue through new sales or actually being a separate service?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. I guess I would say, certainly, because when you look at the offering as a complete offering, and we're seeing that more and more come down in the marketplace from people who wanted payroll years ago only and Taxpay and Direct Deposit to, hey, I'd like something for my HR administration and time and attendance, in particular. I think what you'd see is the development has helped -- it's both. It's shored up the existing product base, but it's certainly getting more revenue per client in the addition of the time and attendance offerings. When you look at our product development work, it's been about building mobility, so that clients have more choices to how they get to us and do their payroll. So they have a better online product now and they have much better mobility, I think the best app in the marketplace, for us, from a payroll standpoint and combined service. So those kind of shore up the existing products for what clients expect now from a competitive standpoint. So if we didn't have mobility, for example, I think it would have hurt sales and retention over time, particularly as the 2 national players compete. And some of the regionals can't do as much in that standpoint. Then there's also -- when you take something like time and attendance, we didn't offer as robust a product a few years ago as we do now. And so that's been new revenue streams that have helped the HRS growth in time and attendance, HR administration online, both SaaS products, BeneTrac, the benefit enrollment products that we added there and so forth. So it's a combination of shoring up and keeping it very competitive, and then also adding more products to it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gary Bisbee (Analysts)】\nOkay. Great. And then just one more question about the competition. And I totally realize that you grow your revenue in dollar terms more in a year than the size of most of these new upstarts. So looking at the growth rates is unfair. But there just seems to be an awful lot more press, my very unscientific review of banner ads on the web and other things, is just showing a lot more discussion around some of these upstarts. So in light of all that, have you changed the mix or sophistication of how you're marketing and attracting customers, doing leach-in [ph] efforts to compete with what seems like some more brand awareness and probably, somewhat more tech-savvy new entrants trying to come after your market share?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. A couple of things on that. One, I think one of the positive things about all the press on some of these regional players doing IPOs or partial IPOs, I guess I'd say, is that they bring more awareness to the market of the products. And so, there's a little bit of a plus there for all of us. And then I think when you look at Paychex or another national competitor, hopefully, clients see a much bigger strength there of being around for 40 years and producing consistently solid results, retention service numbers, et cetera. So I think there's actually a little bit of a plus there. And we already had the competition. So it's interesting. From a marketing perspective, we definitely have pushed a lot more on the web. We're picking up a lot more leads from the market search. And that's been a bigger part of our approach. We also have found a much better way to handle those leads. We've evolved into much more real-time handling of the leads themselves that come in. So I think our marketing has picked up some, always can do, I think, more, but it's a balance of where do you spend the money, is it on marketing or on sales, which we kind of put in that category. And we'll always tend to give more on the sales side and put more on our actual execution of the sales team and put more money there for supporting the sales team and their execution. But I think the marketing -- our marketing has picked up. Our website is much stronger. Our whole process of handling the leads is stronger, and I guess that's how I'd look at it. And I appreciate that you do talk about looking at absolute numbers of growth, as opposed to percentages because that certainly means a lot to us. The amount of growth of what 5% to 6% means for us is a lot bigger than sometimes the entire company that someone else might be looking at.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nAnd, Gary, one other thing I'd add to what Marty said, we don't talk a lot about the efforts that support sales. But we have an entire organization where we've made significant investments on national sales support office here, both in terms of technology and numbers of people. And I would say, I would put our ability to both generate and convert leads up against anyone. We can put a person, feet on the street within hours of getting a web lead, which I don't think many people can do. And we also have both SurePayroll, as I mentioned to some of you, SurePayroll and our core sales competing, we let them compete head-to-head in terms of web sales leads. So we don't feel like we're missing anything that's occurring in the market. We just don't toot our horn with respect to that, either. I think to be in this game long term, not short term, but to be in it long term, you have to have a compelling service proposition and a compelling technology position. And what we've been doing is we've been improving both. Some people in the competition have not been doing that. We think long term, the right solution that works is the one that combines -- that creates a sustainable advantage by maximizing both, not just one.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sara Gubins (Analysts)】\nA question about checks per payroll trends and the 1% growth in the quarter. I know that your comparison was more difficult and you'd highlighted that it would slow. But I'm just wondering what you'd expect going forward and if there's any potential mix impact on that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nThere's a little bit of mix impact always. Just to kind of refresh recollection, we're not doing a same-store comparison. We do a little bit of validation to make sure it's not too wacky but it's not a same-store comparison. We're just taking the amount of checks we admitted and comparing them to a prior period. So you get some mix effect in there. I think, Sara, what happened, we had a pretty strong Q3 last year. There was some Sandy overhang, there were bonuses in there we think that may have affected that number. Now we're normalizing down in the -- I would say that we're down in the 1%, 1.5% range. That's what we've seen during the year. Our assumption is that will continue to moderate. But we'll see, we haven't called it precisely correctly. So you're going to get some variability there. And our expectation is we're -- one, we'll be probably moderating slightly down from there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sara Gubins (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then separately, could you talk a bit more about the new payment-processing service with Elavon? And I'm wondering how that fits into the chain of client acquisition since I generally think of clients signing up for credit card processing first and then maybe adding on payroll solutions after that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nWell, I think -- Sara, you're right. I think when we went into this and we started trialing it, we really kind of looked at that we're getting in pretty early on a new business and that we had -- because we had feet on the street, we would get to the new businesses as they started up and would be successful in signing them up for the first time. And what we found in trialing it in a number of zones around the country was that wasn't always the case and that -- so we actually changed the sales model around and we sell more of that now basically over the phone and into the client base and we're having more success there. And so what we found is it's kind of its own animal. So if you -- you have to know the pricing, you have to know how to price it per transaction, the different kinds of businesses. And what we found was a little bit more of a specialized team over the phone and concentrated could sell into the client base more successfully than 1,200 reps going at brand-new clients the first time. So we trialed that around, found the best way we think to sell it and now we've kind of officially introduced it. And we're just starting to get some traction and results on it but we're definitely starting to get some traction. So we feel with over 500,000 clients and under that on the small business side that we've got a nice opportunity there. Elavon, obviously -- so what we're doing is setting it up. We're getting to the client base who have the strength of knowing the Paychex brand and knowing that they already use us for money flow and so forth. And that by trusting us that they'll sign up with us with competitive packages and all the solutions that Elavon brings and then we get a piece of that action on a go-forward basis.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Macdonald (Analysts)】\nBack when you used to report HR client service employees on a sequential basis, you sometimes had a more moderate growth over year end, given the high attrition. It looks like you had a really good quarter. Does that mean you actually had pretty good client employee growth over year end this year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI think we had good growth over year end. But I think, Jim, we just really have had strong sales in HR Services overall. It's been a good sales year from that perspective.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Macdonald (Analysts)】\nAnd does the processing day impact next quarter? You said that HR Services wouldn't be at the low end next quarter of growth rate. Is that affected by processing day or is it something else there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nNo, there's a little bit of impact on there. But I also called out, we had a very, very strong quarter in terms of HR Solutions. And look, we'd love to have every single quarter look like that. But at this point, we don't think that will repeat quite to the extent it did this quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Macdonald (Analysts)】\nAnd just one final sort of technical question. So last quarter, your SG&A sort of jumped a bunch. And this quarter, it was -- didn't -- wasn't -- the increase wasn't very much at all. Anything going on there that I should know about?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nNot really. What ends up happening -- what's ending up happening in SG&A is that we are adjusting as we go through the year variable elements of comps. Sometimes we get it right, sometimes we overshoot a little bit. And we developed a view of kind of how it's going to project quarter-over-quarter. I would say in terms of the year, we think it will be pretty close to what we expected to plan, maybe it shifted a little bit from one quarter to another. And then rate of IT spending also has an impact on that. So it can shift a little bit but it's not dramatically beyond what we expected when we started the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ryan Davis (Analysts)】\nThis is Ryan calling in for George. I have -- the first question about the selling season. It sounds like you guys had some positive comments around it. Is it surrounding like the overall selling environment being better or is it maybe a product of market share gains or a combination of the 2?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think -- well, I think the overall environment is okay. I think it's still -- we would say from a new business start, one way to gauge it, is it's still fairly sluggish. I think new business starts are up a bit, but it's nothing to kind of write home about. It's not back to prerecession levels yet that we've seen. Employment is up a little when we look at checks per payroll and so forth. So I think it's just kind of continued good execution on the sales side more than the environment has suddenly swelled or anything. I think we've seen some positive in the environment but it hasn't been anything to be overly excited about. We see kind of a steady improvement in the small business environment. Efrain, anything you want to add? And as I think I said, the execution has been consistent and good there. So I think it's been just as much that, more that than the environment itself.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, I agree with that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ryan Davis (Analysts)】\nOkay. Okay, fair enough. Now focusing in on the margins x -- they've been on a nice upward trajectory over the last several years. Is there a point where it kind of takes a breather given commentary, I guess, of accelerating new sales growth '14 over '13 and some of the acquisitions and immigration costs? Is it fair to assume the margin could take a breather?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI think we'll talk more about that when we get to the fourth quarter and talk about plans. The rate and the extent of leverage is a function in part of top line growth. So as we grow top line more, we get more ability to leverage. So we have to go through the plan and look at it. I would just say what I say to everyone on this point, which is that when we go into a plan, we look at trying to get leverage. And when we get the leverage, we try to beat it during the year. So that's what you see.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ryan Davis (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just one quick model-making question. Sorry to do this, but it looked like there is a negative swing in the net change in funds held for clients off the cash flow and balance, pretty significant. I guess, what is that from?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nNot sure what exactly you're pointing to.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ryan Davis (Analysts)】\nSo year-over-year, it looks like there's $1.4 billion negative change in funds held for clients?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nOh, I'm sorry. Yes. I would urge you to really think about average funds held for clients. It really is very dependent on when a particular quarter closes, how much we have in funds, how much we've disbursed on that day or that quarter. On average, if you look at our Q -- I think the 9 months, we call out the balance -- the average balance is $3.7 billion. So that's really what you need to focus on, we're up about 5% for the 9-month period. Quarter to quarter, it can really, really swing and it's really a function of when the quarter ended, what funds we were holding, what payments needed to be made.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ashwin Shirvaikar (Analysts)】\nI guess my first question is with regards to the impact of new partner products that you introduced and some of this you covered, but there's been a range, payments, accounting, payroll cards, the new announcement recently. What is the revenue implication in terms of ramping revenues off that? And also, given they're partner products as opposed to your own products, how does that work with regards to margins and split of economics?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nWell, obviously, we wouldn't give too much detail on it from a competitive standpoint what we're doing with the partners exactly. But it's pretty small to begin with. What we think that there's a nice value-added advantage we have of getting into the client base and we've decided instead of -- certain things like payment processing, instead of going out and acquiring a global payments processor or a regional payments processor was better to just get a commission on the sales there on the ongoing transactions. And so it's positive, but it's going to be pretty small compared to our overall revenue. We certainly hope it will grow with the client base as we penetrate the client base more, but it's a little bit early to tell. When you look at the accounting, remember that there's -- that's a partnership with kind of an investment in CashU and then labeling our own products. So a piece of that, it will be pretty small for a while until we start converting clients and getting them to register. And then over time, we may make a bigger investment there and then it starts to show up as a bigger impact on our revenue stream. So again, these tend to be small longer-term investments that we think have a great opportunity to become significant but over the longer period of time.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nThe other thing, Ashwin, I'd say, just to echo what Marty said, it is a longer-term play. But in the shorter term, what we know is that the more products a client has, the stickier they are. So that's part of what we're trying to do, is build multiple touch points with the client so that they are stickier within the base.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ashwin Shirvaikar (Analysts)】\nRight. Right, understood. With regards to one of the product lines that you have for some time now, health care, how big is it? And with regards to ACA being, I guess, for the small business segment below 100 being pushed out by maybe a year, is that affecting growth in the segment or are people looking forward and saying this is something they need to do?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. I think -- from a size perspective, I think we publicly said the agency is over $100 million in revenue and that we have over 100,000 clients and -- as are for insurance agency. And I think specific to the health piece of it, it is, as I mentioned earlier, has moderated a bit because I think clients -- it's been a good opportunity for us to get in front of clients and support them with the products that we've already rolled out, which help them decide. There's tools there as to whether kind of monthly reporting and monitoring services, whether it applies to them or not. But I think all the confusion and the delays of now the 50 to 100 don't have to have insurance for their employees in '15, 2015. I think all that has moderated the sales of some of the products in the short term. I do think as you approach the fall and people start looking at their annual premiums going up, I think they will -- we'll be well positioned to offer them options and expertise to combine both -- because we offer that payroll company all the other solutions that we have, added services and an insurance agency. I think it will position us well. But it kind of pushed it out a bit as the rules have been -- and the requirements have pushed out.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ashwin Shirvaikar (Analysts)】\nRight. And just so I understand, are these the people that your sales force that were selling it, was it a specialized sales force and does it now have to be refocused on other things or is it more fungible than that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nNo. It's a specialized sales force on the health and benefit side and the workers' comp insurance and other insurances side. We are a full-service agency. They're a specific sales force that are licensed and sell those products in the field and over the phone. And they're still out selling. And there's good execution there. It's just not quite as a big of an increase as we expected. We think it's more moderate but it will continue to -- it's continuing to grow, that's for sure.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ashwin Shirvaikar (Analysts)】\nOkay. My last question is with regards to the index that you introduced. How much of that is more of a branding exercise versus is there a lack of information in the public domain today that you will focus on bringing out? What sort of information is there at [indiscernible] and public domain?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. There's a -- I mean, there's a number of indexes out there. But I think we felt -- and we've talked about this for a number of years internally about whether to do it or not. We think that we're kind of uniquely positioned because the one thing that we keep getting asked is more -- looking for more real-time data on small business grow. And we're taking basically a subset of our overall client base of 350,000 of the clients under 50 and creating an index that same-store sale -- same-store that kind of shows year-over-year what the worker growth is for those clients. And I -- well, the conclusion we came to was we have some unique data here. Typically, you would get that kind of data from federal indexes that are -- or federal sources that are kind of lagged 3 quarters and that we were getting the push for, hey, how about some real-time data from some of your clients. So we felt that we had something unique here. It's real time, it focuses on under 50. And I think we have some of the best data in the business. And so we produced an index that we think will add something a little bit different to the marketplace.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Smittipon Srethapramote (Analysts)】\nJust a couple of quick questions on pricing. You talk about offering a bundle of the core payroll products with some online solutions. What does the pricing look like there? Is there a higher revenue per client solution? Or does it fall somewhere between the core product or just the pure SaaS product?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nNo. It's really -- when you don't count SurePayroll in there, if you look at just the Paychex offerings, there's no real difference. It's a complete offering for the small business under 50. You're looking at a complete offering with both online and that's part of the full suite. You're getting full service, dedicated service, and you have the online and mobility. It's all part of shoring up that product. The good news that we've seen is we're continuing to grow the revenue per client, as we've said. And we think that that's been part of higher retention and better -- new business revenue being higher. So a stronger -- I guess a stronger offering that is driving up the revenue per client. And again, we've said that the price increases are holding as well. So we think that's all part of a complete offering. When you look at SurePayroll, it's a different offering. It's roughly a third typically in an average client that we see and we've said that. And that's continuing to hold up very well on a price perspective as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Smittipon Srethapramote (Analysts)】\nGot it. And on the HRS side, you mentioned that in the release that you're getting higher average premiums in workers' comp. Does that -- is that going to translate into higher expected claims cost or is it all pass through?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nNo. That's just an underlying rate that we've negotiated with carriers. It really doesn't have to do -- and on workers' comp, by the way, that's, at least within our agency, that's brokered business. So we're not taking any risk on that portion of business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Silber (Analysts)】\nI know it's late, I'll just ask one quick one. Efrain, on the guidance and looking at the operating margin, I know you said 38% could be 38.5%. But even at that level, it does imply some margin contraction for the fourth quarter. Is my math correct? Is there something going on that we should know about?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nWell, you're right. You're right, Jeff. And if you look at every fourth quarter, kind of going back probably 3 years, you see we have pretty significant contraction in the quarter. And it's just a higher spend quarter in general. And part of that just to get kind of one level deeper is that IT spending typically has been going up double digits, this year is no exception. And that ramps through the year so that we exit the year at higher spending. And then there's other sales-related expenses that occur in that quarter that typically kind of burden that margin a bit more.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Silber (Analysts)】\nBut would that still imply margin contraction on a year-over-year basis compared to the fourth quarter last year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI haven't looked at the quarter-over-quarter. I'm just sticking to guidance. It shouldn't, Jeff. Even if we're between 38% and 39%, it -- we should be a little bit better. I have to look at it specifically.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tien-Tsin Huang (Analysts)】\nI just want to ask about retention. I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you give any color around what retention looked like in the quarter versus [indiscernible]?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nTien-tsin, we just said it continued to be very strong. I think we're still looking at approximately the highest levels of retention we've had in our -- in history, certainly 5 to 6 years. So we still feel very good about the client retention that we're seeing in the client base.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tien-Tsin Huang (Analysts)】\nAll right, that's good to know. And then just -- I know you had a lot of questions, not surprisingly, about SaaS and some of the changes going on in the public marketplace. But just -- can you just give us a quick high-level thumbnail sketch on just right now, today, point solutions versus service bureau, sort of given all this stuff that's going on in the world with ACA, what have you. What are you seeing on the ground in terms of preference between the 2 sides because I know there can be some push and pull at different periods of the cycle.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. Not seeing any drastic change. I think we've continued because of the investments we've made and what we've rolled out. We feel good about the SaaS offerings that we have, both small market and large, that we're well positioned on the perspective from the offerings, from small business to mid-market, the time and attendance, the HR administration, the benefit enrollment, all real SaaS solutions. But our focus has been very much offering the combination of that with the service. That's what folks are not seeing as much when they're -- usually when they're going somewhere else. We're still trying to give you that dedicated model and focusing that you have all the technology, you have all the SaaS and cloud-based solution that you want, all online now. There isn't -- we're not selling software that you're putting on your system and haven't been really for some time. It's all SaaS based. And everything is becoming more and more integrated across the product set. So we feel very well positioned there. So even with all the hype, we probably, as I think Efrain mentioned earlier, we don't hype that as much. And people look at us more as a service bureau. But we're very much a SaaS-based with a service model is how we look at it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tien-Tsin Huang (Analysts)】\nYes, that makes perfect sense. Just lastly and I'll let you go. Just the PEO stuff, a lot of good commentary there. Are you making some incremental investments in the PEO, given some of the commentary around pickup in demand?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. What we did previously, probably last year, they went more to the SaaS model, the new online Paychex Next Gen product. And so I think what we're seeing is that paid off -- that's been paying off very nicely because not only did we always have good service in the PEO model but as the PEO kind of became more in favor, back in favor in the marketplace, we were really well positioned to execute on the sales side, not only for the need but because we have the technology and the service level.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nOne strategic question. Just as we continue to see an expansion in terms of the solution set, how are you thinking about build versus buy versus alliances as you optimize your solution set? Just -- you've had a couple of experiences. Just how are you thinking about that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. I think -- we look at that a lot. It's always -- we're very proud of the investments that we've made and that we're feeling good about them paying off as we kind of talked about through the call. But we're always on an eye to a year out, 2 years out, 3 years out and how well positioned are we in the various markets. And we're very open to build or partner and we're always kind of looking pretty closely at that. We think we have a tremendous distribution model still. Our field sales team, close to 3,000 salespeople in the field have continued to execute. And so it's all about how fast can we give them more to sell and what's the best way to do that. And obviously, you've seen on kind of the smaller end, when we look at payment processing, we think there's an opportunity there, we partner. When we look at a new product like Accounting Online, we partner. If we think that in various markets, we're better off partnering, we'll look at the economics of that and the opportunity to grow and we're very open to it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then with regards to some of the sales initiatives that you put in place, such as going after franchisees, can you just give us a little bit of a sense for what areas have seen the strongest results in terms of the initiatives that you laid out at your analyst meeting?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. I think, one, the banking channel for us has been something that in the past, we were much stronger on the CPA channel, not as strong on the banks. I think that Mark Bottini and the team there, building a team that really dedicated more focus on the banks and the support of the bank channel has led to a number of referrals and sales there. And we've seen that. We think that's been very successful, particularly in certain markets. And because we just focus better, that was one of the initiatives the franchise has picked up as well. I would say even more successful in signing up the franchises. And now we're kind of learning how best to service those franchises. So there is connection to Subway, there's connections to the Yum! brands, there's connection there. Now we're learning who has more kind of clout in those organizations because you're still not -- you're not requiring them to sign up with you but you're driving influence from the headquarters type of thing. And so we're learning a lot how best to partner with the headquarters and with the franchisees. But we're -- that's something we continue to invest in. And I think that team has been very successful in building the relationships and signing up new franchisees from a corporate standpoint. And now we just got to pick up the pace on closing those franchisees. And we're finding different ways to sell into the market once we have the agreements as well. So the initiatives on banks, franchisees and so forth, we feel they are doing good, they're picking up momentum. And so we're feeling pretty good about it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nThat's great. And then one last question with regards to the expense performance this quarter. I mean, it was basically isolated to the other line. What are some of the areas that just fluctuate within that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nThe other line?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nYes. So when we go through the Q, as an example, there's -- you break out expenses between wages and compensation, other.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. You're looking at it by natural categories. I think -- yes, I'd say that our P&L is variable. And we have a fair amount of ability to manage expenses intraquarter. And obviously, based on what we're seeing in the year, we can make adjustments as we go forward. So there's nothing unusual popping out in that category. We have higher IT expenses. And we did a really good job on operating expenses, controlling that growth as the financial statements indicate. So there's nothing strange going on there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nI was just wondering if you could keep that up.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYou know what? Look, if you ignore the natural category expense breakdown, then look at what we're doing, step back a bit, what we're doing is we're leveraging operating costs and we're investing -- continuing to invest in IT. So SG&A growing faster than sales, primarily driven by IT and ops expense is growing slower than sales. That trend, that macro trend, irrespective of where it falls from a natural expense category standpoint, is a trend that we expect to continue.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ashish Sabadra (Analysts)】\nThis is Ashish Sabadra on behalf of Bryan. Most of my questions have been answered. Just a quick one on the CPA channel. I was just wondering if you could provide a quick update on that one.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. That continues to be good for us, pretty solid across-the-board. We maintain those good relationships. And I think the only thing that is -- would moderate that some is just the new business growth, as we've said, continues to be a bit sluggish. And a lot of the new business referrals came from the CPAs. So that has probably tamped that down a little bit. But the relationships and the approach for the CPAs and our referrals from them continue to be okay.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ashish Sabadra (Analysts)】\nGreat, great. And just one more quick question on the partnership model. Is there an opportunity for you to partner with other technology vendors and provide services on top of it? These could be into a segment where you have not currently tapped them, could be much more the big midtier clients or other HR solutions that you currently don't have in your portfolio? I was just wondering if you could just comment on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. We're always -- I may have mentioned earlier, we're always open to that. We think we're not going to go too far flung from what we do but in providing strength to the employer-employee relationship, and if there's a technology lead or a market that we think we can be very successful in and leverage the great 3,000 salespeople that we have out there that execute well and we can bring them something else, we would certainly be open to that versus building. It's always a matter of looking at the economics of that and certainly, what we think is our level of success. So we're certainly open to it and always looking at those alternatives.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Foresi (Analysts)】\nSo just 2 quick ones, hopefully they're quick, but how do you measure the progress of the technology upgrades? In other words, I'm wondering, do you measure that per usage and if there's any color? If not, that's fine. And then just one quick follow-up.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. I wouldn't say as much on usage at this point as it is the selling. So are we selling it, are we competitive. And again with good continued sales execution, we feel good about that and increased penetration. So we're seeing increased attachment and increased penetration in those SaaS solutions. So we feel that that's a good marker for us. And then certainly, retention, and we see good retention of the products that we're rolling out from a technical standpoint. And so we closely monitor that. We look at obviously all the surveys that we're doing on top of that and are constantly tweaking and changing to keep competitive. So I think that it's more of a measurement of that than usage necessarily of the product itself.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Foresi (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then secondly, it sounds like the business is better after sort of slogging away at it for quite some time here. Yet the traditional catalysts like small business starts haven't necessarily picked up. Should we start thinking about that differently? Are there -- are you finding new catalysts within the business that can pick up the slack even though we haven't seen the traditional ones pick up steam?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think that's fair. I mean, we still have a good percentage of our business -- sales that come from new businesses. And while that's sluggish, it certainly is up from where it was last year. It's not back to prerecession levels. So I do think -- I don't want to mislead you and think that new business still isn't a strong part of our business. We're still very good at that and get referrals from CPAs on new business and banks and so forth. But I do think that we -- knowing that we were -- that, that continued to be kind of sluggish coming back, we look for new ways to attract, to get referrals. We look at new ways to retain clients. We look at new products and investing a lot of the technology investment has been that -- we also, I think, have gotten -- have done a nice job in building the revenue per client. And so we're thinking even getting better at saying, hey, we've got a lot of product here to sell into the client base. And we're not going to wait around for the economy to be superstrong. Let's just sell into the client base, as well as bring in new clients. And I think maybe that mix is changing a little bit. Efrain, anything you want to add?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI'd agree, Joe. So I think that the execution you're seeing is a result of our ability to extract value from the distribution base we've got and there's a long way -- we've got a long way to go in that process.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think we've also found new ways to refine it. So if you take like our initiatives on 401(k), we always sold into the small market, what we would say small market for 401(k) very successful. And -- but we started looking at how do we increase that over what we've always been doing. And we found a way to go into the large market, larger assets for clients and we really sent -- built a sales team just focused on that, built a team, small team focused on financial advisors and getting more leads from them. So we're not just going the traditional route. We've really worked hard to find new ways to grow what we've always been good at.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Grossman (Analysts)】\nSorry, I'm late here. I actually got on the call late so if this has been answered, we can take this offline. But just really quickly, I had a quick question about the exchanges. What -- where are you -- I know you had announced a partnership with one of the small business exchanges. Just kind of wondering where you are in that process and what impact you expect the exchanges to have on your business, both near term as well as out 2 to 3 years based on what you know right now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think Evolution1 was the partner we were in with. And we have that set up. And we're not -- one of the things that we were trying to do there was help businesses, small businesses who are under pressure to give to -- who don't have to do small business group insurance, small group insurance but want to provide something to their clients, to do some pretax and then go over to the private exchange and use that. Unfortunately, some of the changes in the health care reform kind of took away that benefit, at least at this point, for pretax benefit. So if I'm a small group employer and I want to just give $300 a month to my employee pretax, that's not really necessarily an alternative anymore that it's going to be pretax and so forth. So it slowed kind of that whole thing for us on the private exchange piece. We still have the partnership, we still offer it. It's just not quite as attractive as it was previously. And that may still change, as these rules kind of solidify over the next year or so. But I do -- and then the exchanges in general, we have not seen as much of a loss, I would say, to the exchanges yet that we thought we might see on the small business side. And we haven't -- we've seen the sales to those who need insurance, we've seen that moderated, as I mentioned earlier. Just -- we haven't seen as much of a decision-making process from the clients because they're kind of confused and they realize that like the 50 to 100 don't have to do anything now in 2015, they have until 2016. So I'd say, overall, the whole exchange piece hasn't caused any major disruption. It also hasn't accelerated anything. It's been a more moderate kind of thing. And we expect we'll see more of the opportunity and maybe the impact in the next fiscal year as they approach 2000 -- really '16 will be the bigger impact.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nGreat. Thank you. And at this point, we'll close the meeting. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately a month until April 28. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our third quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great day.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Jodi. Good morning to everyone. This morning's release reviews our second quarter and first half fiscal 2014 operating results for the 12- and 24-week periods ended February 16, and our monthly sales results for the 4-week reporting month of February, which ended this past Sunday, March 2.\r\nThe discussions we are having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.\r\nTo begin with, our 12-week second quarter. For the quarter, we reported earnings of $1.05 a share. This compared to last year's second quarter earnings reported at $1.24. \r\nAs noted in this morning's release, last year's earnings figure was positively impacted by a $62 million or $0.14 per share income tax benefit that was in connection with the portion of the special cash dividend we paid in December of '12 to the company 401(k) plan participants. \r\nSeveral factors impacted our second quarter earnings beyond that. These included lower sales and gross margins in hardlines, most particularly during the 4-week holiday period between Thanksgiving and Christmas; lower year-over-year gross margins in fresh foods; the FX impact of weaker foreign exchange rates year-over-year when reporting profits from our international operations. This represented, if you assumed no change year-over-year in the currency exchange rates, about $23 million pretax or a little over $0.03 a share. \r\nFor example, this year in Q2 versus 1 year ago, the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar was down 8% and Japan about 15%. In addition, on income tax rate even after excluding that tax benefit I just mentioned, it was still 1.5 percentage points higher year-over-year in the second quarter. Last year in Q2, as I had mentioned then, there were a couple of positive discrete items that have lowered last year's rate by about $10 million or $0.02 a share. \r\nAs well, in both this year's and last year's second fiscal quarter, there were a few other discrete items in the aggregate -- that in the aggregate, represented a year-over-year negative swing to our SG&A expenses by about 5 basis points or $0.02 a share. So while earnings results for the first 4 weeks of Q2 were very weak, earnings in the subsequent 8 weeks in the second quarter showed improvement. \r\nIn terms of sales for the quarter. Total sales were up 6%, and on a comp basis, up 3%. For the quarter, sales were negatively impacted by gas price deflation, as well, and a bigger impact by weakening foreign currencies relative to the dollar year-over-year. That alone was about 200 basis points. \r\nExcluding gas, the reported 4% U.S. comp in Q2 would have been plus 5, and the reported flat international comp, assuming flat year-over-year FX rates, would have been plus 7. As I said, the total company reported, which we reported again the 3% comp for the quarter, excluding gas FX, would have been plus 5.\r\nFor the 4-week month of February, which included the last 2 weeks of the fiscal second quarter, comps came in at a plus 2. This consisted of a plus 3 reported in the U.S., minus 1 internationally. Again, gas deflation and FX had an impact, such that the 3% reported U.S. comp increase for February would have been a plus 4, and the minus 1 international, excluding same FX exchange rates year-over-year, would been plus 5. And the total company, the plus 2 that we reported would have been a plus 4. \r\nI'll now mention, which I haven't for quite a while, weather. It's been all over, particularly in the U.S., snow, rain, just crazy weather. We estimate that the weather impact to February sales results represented about a 1 percentage point hit to the 4-week reporting period. \r\nIn terms of new openings, after opening 13 new locations in the first quarter, as well as closing our Acapulco, Mexico location due to the hurricane damage, we opened 3 new locations in the second quarter: 2 in the U.S.; 1 each in Illinois and Texas; and 1 also in Ontario, Canada. All told, that puts our fiscal 2014 openings through the second quarter at 16 new locations. And we now operate 649 locations around the world. And between now and the end of fiscal '14, we expect to open an additional 14 locations, 3 in the third quarter, and 11 in the fourth quarter. These 14, which again, this will be before fiscal year end on August 31, 6 are planned for the U.S., 2 additional locations in each of Japan and Korea, and one each in Canada, U.K., Australia and of course, our first location opening in Spain, in Seville this spring. Such that we'd expect to end the year with 30 new openings for the year. \r\nThis morning, I'll review with you, of course, our membership trends and renewal rates, our e-commerce activity and, of course, additional discussion about margins and SG&A. To start off, again, sales -- total sales were up to $25.76 billion, up 6% year-over-year. And comps, again, was reported 3 and -- a plus 3 and a plus 5 excluding gas and FX. \r\nIn terms of the 3, the plus 3% reported comp sales, the average transaction was minus 1% for the quarter on a reported basis. Again, FX was impacted that as well. It would have been a little over 1% plus on a flat currency year-over-year. \r\nAnd average frequency was a little over 4%. For the 3 recent months, frequency was just under 4%, just under 5% and just under 3% for January -- December, January and February. And year-to-date, shopping frequency continues to be in the 4.5% -- 4.25% range. \r\nIn terms of sales by geographic region, both for the 12-week quarter and the 4 weeks of February, geographically, Southeast, Midwest and San Diego regions were strongest. Internationally as well, both for the quarter and the 4 weeks of February, the strongest regions in local currencies were Mexico and Canada. \r\nFor the second quarter, in terms of merchandise categories within food and sundries, overall, low-single digits. For hardlines, overall, in the mid-single digits. Within that, we are asked about consumer electronics that was slightly positive for the quarter overall. Within the mid-single digit comp range for softlines. And then in fresh foods, up in the mid- to high-single digits overall, with produce being the strongest. \r\nFor February, again, the traffic was up just under 3%, shopping frequency. Again, the reported average transaction was down about a little over 1%, but again, a big impact from gas and FX. In fact, just during the month of February year-over-year, the average sale price for gasoline was down about 10% for the month per gallon. \r\nFrom a merchandising category standpoint, food and sundries, overall, was in the low single-digit range. Hardlines overall came in slightly negative, with electronics being down in the mid-single digit range. Softlines was the strongest area in the mid to high single-digit range. And finally, fresh foods, mid-single digit range overall, again, produce being particularly strong. \r\nIn terms of moving down the income statement, in terms of membership fees, $550 million, up from 4% or $22 million from a year earlier, $528 million. Again, you've got the impact of FX. If we assumed flat year-over-year FX, that reported $550 million membership fee number would have been $563 million or up 7% year-over-year. \r\nIn terms of membership, our renewal rates continue at record levels, and we continue to see increasing penetration of the Executive Membership. New membership sign-ups in the second quarter company-wide were up 13% year-over-year, again, mostly reflective of very strong sign-ups in some of our international openings, including the recent new openings in Japan and Australia. \r\nIn terms of number of members. Gold Star, we ended the first quarter, 3 months, 12 weeks ago at 29.6 million. At Q2 end, it was 30.1 million. Business Primary rounded both at Q1 end and Q2 end at 6.7 million. Business add-on at 3.5 million each. So all told, 39.8 million at Q1 end, up to 40.3 million at Q2 end, including the additional card, 72.5 million at Q1 end. That was up about 900,000 to 73.4 million at Q2 end. \r\nAlso at the second quarter end, Paid Executive memberships were just over 14 million, an increase of almost 200,000 since Q1 end or about 15,000 a week in the quarter. Then again, Executive Members are roughly 35% of sales, and a little over 2/3 of our sales, 35% of our membership base, a little over 2/3 of our sales. \r\nAnd in terms of renewal rates, as I mentioned, they continue to tweak up a little bit. At Q1 end, Business memberships renewal rates were 94.1. At Q2 end, it was 94.3. Gold Star 89.3, went to 89.6. So all told, 90.2 up to 90.4. And of course, that's U.S. and Canada, our most -- 80% of our company in our most mature markets. Worldwide, including all the new countries over the last several years, 86.5 went to 86.8. So again, continuing good trends in membership renewal rates. \r\nGoing down to the gross margin line. We were down, year-over-year, 6 basis points in the quarter from a 10.59% down to a 10.53%. \r\nAgain, I'll ask, as I always do ask you, to jot down the following 4 columns and 6 line items to give you a little explanation of the components of margin. The first 2 columns would be the Q1 '14 reported and Q1 '14 excluding gas deflation. Columns 3 and 4 would be Q2 reported, and column 4 would be without gas deflation in Q2. \r\nGoing across merchandise core. Reported in Q1, it was up 12 basis points year-over-year, but excluding gas deflation, was up 3. Going -- again, continuing across, reported in Q2 was plus 1, and without gas deflation minus 1. Ancillary, plus 5 and plus 2 reported in -- without gas in Q1, and 0 and 0 in columns 3 and 4. 2% Reward, minus 3 and minus 2, and then in the second quarter, minus 1 and minus 1. LIFO, minus 1 and minus 1, and in the second quarter, minus 6 and minus 6. Other, which I don't need to add here, the 0 is across the columns there. And all told, in total in Q1 '14, we reported year-over-year gross margin up 13 basis points but taking out the effect of gas deflation, up -- it was up 2. \r\nAgain, today we reported plus 6 -- I'm sorry, minus 6 in lower margins year-over-year in the second quarter. Without gas deflation, it would have been minus 8. So as you can see again the minus 6, minus 8 without gas deflation. And our core was essentially flat plus 1, minus 1 within and without gas deflation. \r\nFor the second quarter year-over-year, food and sundries and softline gross margins were up in the second quarter year-over-year in the 5 to 20 basis point range, while hardlines and fresh foods margins were lower year-over-year in the minus 30 to minus 50 basis points range. Ancillary business gross margins, percentages were essentially flat year-over-year, but again you've got sales impact of a 10% year-over-year lower gallon each comp -- gallon in terms of price of gas. \r\nThe impact of the increasing Executive Membership, again, 1 basis point add, just meaning more dollars going to their Rewards-based membership, Executive Membership program. In terms of LIFO in the second quarter, we recorded a $5 million pretax charge this year in the quarter. That compares to a $9 million pretax credit last year. So year-over-year, a $14 million or $0.02 a share swing, and that was a 6 basis points year-over-year negative. \r\nAs I've said, when there's both LIFO credit or a LIFO charge or this type of swing, positive or negative, the fact is we really look at that as part of our core, given that they work in tandem. \r\nMoving in terms of reported SG&A. Our SG&A percentages, Q2-over-Q2, were higher or worse by 13 basis points, coming in at 9.83 as a percent of sales compared to 9.70% last year. The minus 13 translates to minus 10 x gas deflation. And again, we'll put down -- for us, you put down the 4 columns and, in this case, 5 line items. Again Q1, for 2 columns Q1, both reported and x gas deflation, and then Q2, reported and x gas deflation. \r\nGoing across, core Operations was a minus 9 in Q1 reported -- I mean, higher by 9 basis points. 0, without gas deflation in Q2, was a minus 12 and a minus 9. Central in Q1 was a minus 3 and a minus 2, both 0s -- 0 and 0 in Q2. RSUs, or stock compensation, minus 5 and minus 5 in Q1, and minus 1 and minus 1 in Q2. Quarterly adjustments were 0s across the board, and then total was a minus 17 year-over-year higher SG&A in Q1 reported but again, x gas deflation was a minus 7. And in Q2, reported minus 13 becomes a minus 10 that I just mentioned. \r\nIn terms of these SG&A figures, the core operations again was at minus 12, but minus 9 x gas deflation. Within core, our payroll as a percent of sales was higher year-over-year by 2 basis points. Payroll benefits and workers' comp combined hit SG&A by about 1 basis point. And utilities, of course, a lot of cold weather, was down 2 basis -- was higher by 2 basis points. \r\nAgain, as I mentioned early in both this year's and last year's second fiscal quarter, we had a few discrete items that, in the aggregate, represented a year-over-year swing in our SG&A expense by 5 basis points or $14 million or $0.02 a share. That generally is the luck of the draw. Sometimes that helps us, sometimes that hurts us but that was a net negative year-over-year swing. \r\nAnd central was flat year-over-year, notwithstanding ongoing IT modernization costs, which will continue, which represented about a 3-basis-point higher year-over-year hit to SG&A. Next on the income statement line is pre-opening. Last year, it was $6 million, it's up $2 million to $8 million this year. Even though last year, we had 5 openings and this year, we had 3. But some of that's the timing of openings -- pre-opening impacts several months. A big chunk of it also is the more significant preopening expense related to our upcoming opening in Spain as we essentially are opening a new country. \r\nAll told, operating income in the second quarter came in at $724 million year-over-year, down 2% from last year's $738 million. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was higher year-over-year by $1 million, coming in at $26 million this year versus $25 million last year. Virtually all of that is interest expense related to not only the $1.1 billion fixed rate, 5.6% interest debt that we have that will mature in March of '17, but also the $3.5 billion debt that we issued last December, which has a weighted average in the low 1% range. \r\nInterest income and other was higher year-over-year by $4 million in the quarter, coming in at $30 million this year versus $26 million last year. Actual interest income was about half of that $4 million increase, $2 million higher year-over-year. And the other component was a $2 million swing, $5 million plus last year versus $3 million plus this year. So $2 million better year-over-year. \r\nOverall pretax income was down 1.6% or $11 million in the second quarter, down from $739 million to $728 million this year. Our tax rate in the quarter came in at a 35.0%. Last year, it was 25.1%. And as discussed earlier, a big chunk of that was the income tax benefit from that $62 million benefit in conjunction with the special cash dividend. \r\nExcluding that onetime benefit, our tax rate last year in Q2, that 25.1% would have been a 33.5%, still lower when compared to this year's 35.0%. Again, as I mentioned in last year's second quarter conference call, there were a couple of positive discrete items that went our way in Q2 last year, again, to the tune of about $10 million. After-tax interest at the tax line were $0.02 a share last year that we didn't have the benefit of this year. \r\nOverall reported net income of $547 million last year in Q2, excluding that $62 million income tax benefit, would have been $485 million. And that compares to our $463 million this year, down a little bit. \r\nNext in terms of balance sheet, which is included in this morning's press release, I will note a couple of balance sheet info items. Depreciation and amortization for the second quarter was $240 million and $471 million year-to-date. Accounts payable as a percent of inventories on a reported basis year-over-year is down from 98% to 93%, although some amount of that is, in the payables calculation, is not merchandise payables such as, most importantly, construction payables. So looking at merchandise payables as a percent of inventories, the 87% last year would have been 83%. \r\nAverage inventory per warehouse is up about 4%, about $500,000 from $12.2 million to $12.7 million. This increase was pretty much spread over all the departments, nothing that really stood out. Overall, our inventories are in good shape. As well, our mid-year fiscal inventories, which we do at the end of the second quarter, were essentially tied with last year's best-ever results in terms of low shrinkage results. So I think, in our view, a good indication of the inventories being managed pretty well. \r\nIn terms of capital expenditures. In the first quarter of '14, we had spent $574 million. In the quarter just ended, we spent an additional $447 million. So all told, just a little over $1 billion year-to-date. Total FX -- total CapEx for fiscal '14, we would expect to be approximately $2.3 billion. I think that's a little up from what I mentioned a quarter ago, reflect -- up from $2.1 billion last year and again, reflecting a little ramp-up in openings. \r\nIn terms of e-commerce operations, we have 4 countries: U.S., Canada, U.K. and most recently a few months ago, we entered e-commerce, we began e-commerce operations in Mexico. For the second quarter, sales and profits were up over last year. While we don't share the profit stuff specifically, the sales were up 20%. In fact, a little higher, given the local currencies, given Canada, but 20% year-over-year. \r\nOver the past 1, 1.5 years, as you know, we've re-platformed the site. We've added some mobile apps. We've combined some e-commerce merchandise efforts with our in-line efforts. We've added a few categories to e-commerce, most recently, apparel and some health and beauty aids. We've improved the timing of shipments by shipping out of 3 depots instead of 1. \r\nWe're currently testing, not that it's specifically based to our e-commerce operations, but we've -- we're testing in the Bay Area. One of several retailers would be Google Express. And also testing a few other things that we'll let you know more about as we do it. \r\nNext on discussion with expansion. Again, we opened 13 in Q1. We have that closed in Acapulco with the hurricane. So net of 12. In Q2, 3. In Q3, 3. In Q4, 11. So 30 openings, plus the Acapulco closing so far. That will put us a net increase for the year of 29, which would be about a 4.5% square footage growth, 4.5% to 5%. \r\nNew locations by country for the 30 openings: 17 in the U.S., 3 in Canada, 1 in the U.K., 2 each in Korea and Japan, 3 in Australia and 1 each in Mexico and Spain. As of second quarter end, square footage stood at 93,098,000 square feet. \r\nIn terms of dividends, our current quarter dividend stands at $0.31 a share. This $1.24 share annualized dividend represents a total cost to the company of about $540 million. \r\nLastly, our third quarter scheduled earnings release date will be Thursday, May 29. That will be for the 12-week quarter ended -- ending on May 11. \r\nBefore I turn it back to Jodi, one comment about Q3 I do want to make. Last year in Q3, we had mentioned that there was a co-location]ph] settlement that benefit last year's third quarter gross margin results by about $17 million pretax or about $0.025 a share, and so we'll be up against that comparison of course. \r\nLet me just say that overall, I hope we have helped you understand a little bit about the factors impacting our results this fiscal quarter, how the earnings performance trended positively during the quarter from a very tough first 4 week period and the continuing strength in sales, comps, shopping frequency and the like. \r\nWith that, Jodi, I'll turn it back over to you.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nThank you, Jodi. Good morning to everyone. This morning's release reviews our second quarter and first half fiscal 2014 operating results for the 12- and 24-week periods ended February 16, and our monthly sales results for the 4-week reporting month of February, which ended this past Sunday, March 2.\r\nThe discussions we are having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.\r\nTo begin with, our 12-week second quarter. For the quarter, we reported earnings of $1.05 a share. This compared to last year's second quarter earnings reported at $1.24. \r\nAs noted in this morning's release, last year's earnings figure was positively impacted by a $62 million or $0.14 per share income tax benefit that was in connection with the portion of the special cash dividend we paid in December of '12 to the company 401(k) plan participants. \r\nSeveral factors impacted our second quarter earnings beyond that. These included lower sales and gross margins in hardlines, most particularly during the 4-week holiday period between Thanksgiving and Christmas; lower year-over-year gross margins in fresh foods; the FX impact of weaker foreign exchange rates year-over-year when reporting profits from our international operations. This represented, if you assumed no change year-over-year in the currency exchange rates, about $23 million pretax or a little over $0.03 a share. \r\nFor example, this year in Q2 versus 1 year ago, the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar was down 8% and Japan about 15%. In addition, on income tax rate even after excluding that tax benefit I just mentioned, it was still 1.5 percentage points higher year-over-year in the second quarter. Last year in Q2, as I had mentioned then, there were a couple of positive discrete items that have lowered last year's rate by about $10 million or $0.02 a share. \r\nAs well, in both this year's and last year's second fiscal quarter, there were a few other discrete items in the aggregate -- that in the aggregate, represented a year-over-year negative swing to our SG&A expenses by about 5 basis points or $0.02 a share. So while earnings results for the first 4 weeks of Q2 were very weak, earnings in the subsequent 8 weeks in the second quarter showed improvement. \r\nIn terms of sales for the quarter. Total sales were up 6%, and on a comp basis, up 3%. For the quarter, sales were negatively impacted by gas price deflation, as well, and a bigger impact by weakening foreign currencies relative to the dollar year-over-year. That alone was about 200 basis points. \r\nExcluding gas, the reported 4% U.S. comp in Q2 would have been plus 5, and the reported flat international comp, assuming flat year-over-year FX rates, would have been plus 7. As I said, the total company reported, which we reported again the 3% comp for the quarter, excluding gas FX, would have been plus 5.\r\nFor the 4-week month of February, which included the last 2 weeks of the fiscal second quarter, comps came in at a plus 2. This consisted of a plus 3 reported in the U.S., minus 1 internationally. Again, gas deflation and FX had an impact, such that the 3% reported U.S. comp increase for February would have been a plus 4, and the minus 1 international, excluding same FX exchange rates year-over-year, would been plus 5. And the total company, the plus 2 that we reported would have been a plus 4. \r\nI'll now mention, which I haven't for quite a while, weather. It's been all over, particularly in the U.S., snow, rain, just crazy weather. We estimate that the weather impact to February sales results represented about a 1 percentage point hit to the 4-week reporting period. \r\nIn terms of new openings, after opening 13 new locations in the first quarter, as well as closing our Acapulco, Mexico location due to the hurricane damage, we opened 3 new locations in the second quarter: 2 in the U.S.; 1 each in Illinois and Texas; and 1 also in Ontario, Canada. All told, that puts our fiscal 2014 openings through the second quarter at 16 new locations. And we now operate 649 locations around the world. And between now and the end of fiscal '14, we expect to open an additional 14 locations, 3 in the third quarter, and 11 in the fourth quarter. These 14, which again, this will be before fiscal year end on August 31, 6 are planned for the U.S., 2 additional locations in each of Japan and Korea, and one each in Canada, U.K., Australia and of course, our first location opening in Spain, in Seville this spring. Such that we'd expect to end the year with 30 new openings for the year. \r\nThis morning, I'll review with you, of course, our membership trends and renewal rates, our e-commerce activity and, of course, additional discussion about margins and SG&A. To start off, again, sales -- total sales were up to $25.76 billion, up 6% year-over-year. And comps, again, was reported 3 and -- a plus 3 and a plus 5 excluding gas and FX. \r\nIn terms of the 3, the plus 3% reported comp sales, the average transaction was minus 1% for the quarter on a reported basis. Again, FX was impacted that as well. It would have been a little over 1% plus on a flat currency year-over-year. \r\nAnd average frequency was a little over 4%. For the 3 recent months, frequency was just under 4%, just under 5% and just under 3% for January -- December, January and February. And year-to-date, shopping frequency continues to be in the 4.5% -- 4.25% range. \r\nIn terms of sales by geographic region, both for the 12-week quarter and the 4 weeks of February, geographically, Southeast, Midwest and San Diego regions were strongest. Internationally as well, both for the quarter and the 4 weeks of February, the strongest regions in local currencies were Mexico and Canada. \r\nFor the second quarter, in terms of merchandise categories within food and sundries, overall, low-single digits. For hardlines, overall, in the mid-single digits. Within that, we are asked about consumer electronics that was slightly positive for the quarter overall. Within the mid-single digit comp range for softlines. And then in fresh foods, up in the mid- to high-single digits overall, with produce being the strongest. \r\nFor February, again, the traffic was up just under 3%, shopping frequency. Again, the reported average transaction was down about a little over 1%, but again, a big impact from gas and FX. In fact, just during the month of February year-over-year, the average sale price for gasoline was down about 10% for the month per gallon. \r\nFrom a merchandising category standpoint, food and sundries, overall, was in the low single-digit range. Hardlines overall came in slightly negative, with electronics being down in the mid-single digit range. Softlines was the strongest area in the mid to high single-digit range. And finally, fresh foods, mid-single digit range overall, again, produce being particularly strong. \r\nIn terms of moving down the income statement, in terms of membership fees, $550 million, up from 4% or $22 million from a year earlier, $528 million. Again, you've got the impact of FX. If we assumed flat year-over-year FX, that reported $550 million membership fee number would have been $563 million or up 7% year-over-year. \r\nIn terms of membership, our renewal rates continue at record levels, and we continue to see increasing penetration of the Executive Membership. New membership sign-ups in the second quarter company-wide were up 13% year-over-year, again, mostly reflective of very strong sign-ups in some of our international openings, including the recent new openings in Japan and Australia. \r\nIn terms of number of members. Gold Star, we ended the first quarter, 3 months, 12 weeks ago at 29.6 million. At Q2 end, it was 30.1 million. Business Primary rounded both at Q1 end and Q2 end at 6.7 million. Business add-on at 3.5 million each. So all told, 39.8 million at Q1 end, up to 40.3 million at Q2 end, including the additional card, 72.5 million at Q1 end. That was up about 900,000 to 73.4 million at Q2 end. \r\nAlso at the second quarter end, Paid Executive memberships were just over 14 million, an increase of almost 200,000 since Q1 end or about 15,000 a week in the quarter. Then again, Executive Members are roughly 35% of sales, and a little over 2/3 of our sales, 35% of our membership base, a little over 2/3 of our sales. \r\nAnd in terms of renewal rates, as I mentioned, they continue to tweak up a little bit. At Q1 end, Business memberships renewal rates were 94.1. At Q2 end, it was 94.3. Gold Star 89.3, went to 89.6. So all told, 90.2 up to 90.4. And of course, that's U.S. and Canada, our most -- 80% of our company in our most mature markets. Worldwide, including all the new countries over the last several years, 86.5 went to 86.8. So again, continuing good trends in membership renewal rates. \r\nGoing down to the gross margin line. We were down, year-over-year, 6 basis points in the quarter from a 10.59% down to a 10.53%. \r\nAgain, I'll ask, as I always do ask you, to jot down the following 4 columns and 6 line items to give you a little explanation of the components of margin. The first 2 columns would be the Q1 '14 reported and Q1 '14 excluding gas deflation. Columns 3 and 4 would be Q2 reported, and column 4 would be without gas deflation in Q2. \r\nGoing across merchandise core. Reported in Q1, it was up 12 basis points year-over-year, but excluding gas deflation, was up 3. Going -- again, continuing across, reported in Q2 was plus 1, and without gas deflation minus 1. Ancillary, plus 5 and plus 2 reported in -- without gas in Q1, and 0 and 0 in columns 3 and 4. 2% Reward, minus 3 and minus 2, and then in the second quarter, minus 1 and minus 1. LIFO, minus 1 and minus 1, and in the second quarter, minus 6 and minus 6. Other, which I don't need to add here, the 0 is across the columns there. And all told, in total in Q1 '14, we reported year-over-year gross margin up 13 basis points but taking out the effect of gas deflation, up -- it was up 2. \r\nAgain, today we reported plus 6 -- I'm sorry, minus 6 in lower margins year-over-year in the second quarter. Without gas deflation, it would have been minus 8. So as you can see again the minus 6, minus 8 without gas deflation. And our core was essentially flat plus 1, minus 1 within and without gas deflation. \r\nFor the second quarter year-over-year, food and sundries and softline gross margins were up in the second quarter year-over-year in the 5 to 20 basis point range, while hardlines and fresh foods margins were lower year-over-year in the minus 30 to minus 50 basis points range. Ancillary business gross margins, percentages were essentially flat year-over-year, but again you've got sales impact of a 10% year-over-year lower gallon each comp -- gallon in terms of price of gas. \r\nThe impact of the increasing Executive Membership, again, 1 basis point add, just meaning more dollars going to their Rewards-based membership, Executive Membership program. In terms of LIFO in the second quarter, we recorded a $5 million pretax charge this year in the quarter. That compares to a $9 million pretax credit last year. So year-over-year, a $14 million or $0.02 a share swing, and that was a 6 basis points year-over-year negative. \r\nAs I've said, when there's both LIFO credit or a LIFO charge or this type of swing, positive or negative, the fact is we really look at that as part of our core, given that they work in tandem. \r\nMoving in terms of reported SG&A. Our SG&A percentages, Q2-over-Q2, were higher or worse by 13 basis points, coming in at 9.83 as a percent of sales compared to 9.70% last year. The minus 13 translates to minus 10 x gas deflation. And again, we'll put down -- for us, you put down the 4 columns and, in this case, 5 line items. Again Q1, for 2 columns Q1, both reported and x gas deflation, and then Q2, reported and x gas deflation. \r\nGoing across, core Operations was a minus 9 in Q1 reported -- I mean, higher by 9 basis points. 0, without gas deflation in Q2, was a minus 12 and a minus 9. Central in Q1 was a minus 3 and a minus 2, both 0s -- 0 and 0 in Q2. RSUs, or stock compensation, minus 5 and minus 5 in Q1, and minus 1 and minus 1 in Q2. Quarterly adjustments were 0s across the board, and then total was a minus 17 year-over-year higher SG&A in Q1 reported but again, x gas deflation was a minus 7. And in Q2, reported minus 13 becomes a minus 10 that I just mentioned. \r\nIn terms of these SG&A figures, the core operations again was at minus 12, but minus 9 x gas deflation. Within core, our payroll as a percent of sales was higher year-over-year by 2 basis points. Payroll benefits and workers' comp combined hit SG&A by about 1 basis point. And utilities, of course, a lot of cold weather, was down 2 basis -- was higher by 2 basis points. \r\nAgain, as I mentioned early in both this year's and last year's second fiscal quarter, we had a few discrete items that, in the aggregate, represented a year-over-year swing in our SG&A expense by 5 basis points or $14 million or $0.02 a share. That generally is the luck of the draw. Sometimes that helps us, sometimes that hurts us but that was a net negative year-over-year swing. \r\nAnd central was flat year-over-year, notwithstanding ongoing IT modernization costs, which will continue, which represented about a 3-basis-point higher year-over-year hit to SG&A. Next on the income statement line is pre-opening. Last year, it was $6 million, it's up $2 million to $8 million this year. Even though last year, we had 5 openings and this year, we had 3. But some of that's the timing of openings -- pre-opening impacts several months. A big chunk of it also is the more significant preopening expense related to our upcoming opening in Spain as we essentially are opening a new country. \r\nAll told, operating income in the second quarter came in at $724 million year-over-year, down 2% from last year's $738 million. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was higher year-over-year by $1 million, coming in at $26 million this year versus $25 million last year. Virtually all of that is interest expense related to not only the $1.1 billion fixed rate, 5.6% interest debt that we have that will mature in March of '17, but also the $3.5 billion debt that we issued last December, which has a weighted average in the low 1% range. \r\nInterest income and other was higher year-over-year by $4 million in the quarter, coming in at $30 million this year versus $26 million last year. Actual interest income was about half of that $4 million increase, $2 million higher year-over-year. And the other component was a $2 million swing, $5 million plus last year versus $3 million plus this year. So $2 million better year-over-year. \r\nOverall pretax income was down 1.6% or $11 million in the second quarter, down from $739 million to $728 million this year. Our tax rate in the quarter came in at a 35.0%. Last year, it was 25.1%. And as discussed earlier, a big chunk of that was the income tax benefit from that $62 million benefit in conjunction with the special cash dividend. \r\nExcluding that onetime benefit, our tax rate last year in Q2, that 25.1% would have been a 33.5%, still lower when compared to this year's 35.0%. Again, as I mentioned in last year's second quarter conference call, there were a couple of positive discrete items that went our way in Q2 last year, again, to the tune of about $10 million. After-tax interest at the tax line were $0.02 a share last year that we didn't have the benefit of this year. \r\nOverall reported net income of $547 million last year in Q2, excluding that $62 million income tax benefit, would have been $485 million. And that compares to our $463 million this year, down a little bit. \r\nNext in terms of balance sheet, which is included in this morning's press release, I will note a couple of balance sheet info items. Depreciation and amortization for the second quarter was $240 million and $471 million year-to-date. Accounts payable as a percent of inventories on a reported basis year-over-year is down from 98% to 93%, although some amount of that is, in the payables calculation, is not merchandise payables such as, most importantly, construction payables. So looking at merchandise payables as a percent of inventories, the 87% last year would have been 83%. \r\nAverage inventory per warehouse is up about 4%, about $500,000 from $12.2 million to $12.7 million. This increase was pretty much spread over all the departments, nothing that really stood out. Overall, our inventories are in good shape. As well, our mid-year fiscal inventories, which we do at the end of the second quarter, were essentially tied with last year's best-ever results in terms of low shrinkage results. So I think, in our view, a good indication of the inventories being managed pretty well. \r\nIn terms of capital expenditures. In the first quarter of '14, we had spent $574 million. In the quarter just ended, we spent an additional $447 million. So all told, just a little over $1 billion year-to-date. Total FX -- total CapEx for fiscal '14, we would expect to be approximately $2.3 billion. I think that's a little up from what I mentioned a quarter ago, reflect -- up from $2.1 billion last year and again, reflecting a little ramp-up in openings. \r\nIn terms of e-commerce operations, we have 4 countries: U.S., Canada, U.K. and most recently a few months ago, we entered e-commerce, we began e-commerce operations in Mexico. For the second quarter, sales and profits were up over last year. While we don't share the profit stuff specifically, the sales were up 20%. In fact, a little higher, given the local currencies, given Canada, but 20% year-over-year. \r\nOver the past 1, 1.5 years, as you know, we've re-platformed the site. We've added some mobile apps. We've combined some e-commerce merchandise efforts with our in-line efforts. We've added a few categories to e-commerce, most recently, apparel and some health and beauty aids. We've improved the timing of shipments by shipping out of 3 depots instead of 1. \r\nWe're currently testing, not that it's specifically based to our e-commerce operations, but we've -- we're testing in the Bay Area. One of several retailers would be Google Express. And also testing a few other things that we'll let you know more about as we do it. \r\nNext on discussion with expansion. Again, we opened 13 in Q1. We have that closed in Acapulco with the hurricane. So net of 12. In Q2, 3. In Q3, 3. In Q4, 11. So 30 openings, plus the Acapulco closing so far. That will put us a net increase for the year of 29, which would be about a 4.5% square footage growth, 4.5% to 5%. \r\nNew locations by country for the 30 openings: 17 in the U.S., 3 in Canada, 1 in the U.K., 2 each in Korea and Japan, 3 in Australia and 1 each in Mexico and Spain. As of second quarter end, square footage stood at 93,098,000 square feet. \r\nIn terms of dividends, our current quarter dividend stands at $0.31 a share. This $1.24 share annualized dividend represents a total cost to the company of about $540 million. \r\nLastly, our third quarter scheduled earnings release date will be Thursday, May 29. That will be for the 12-week quarter ended -- ending on May 11. \r\nBefore I turn it back to Jodi, one comment about Q3 I do want to make. Last year in Q3, we had mentioned that there was a co-location]ph] settlement that benefit last year's third quarter gross margin results by about $17 million pretax or about $0.025 a share, and so we'll be up against that comparison of course. \r\nLet me just say that overall, I hope we have helped you understand a little bit about the factors impacting our results this fiscal quarter, how the earnings performance trended positively during the quarter from a very tough first 4 week period and the continuing strength in sales, comps, shopping frequency and the like. \r\nWith that, Jodi, I'll turn it back over to you.",
      "transcript_text3": "I was wondering if you could just discuss a little bit of your current thoughts on buyback. And then separate question, any thoughts on international membership fees and whether or not they do feel a hike or not?\n\n---\n\nWell, in terms of buyback, again, while we let you guys know once a quarter when we have our quarterly earnings announcement, our intention is to start buying back stock this quarter. We continue to look at it, but I think it's a good statement to say that we will be buying something this quarter. As it relates to international, we're always looking at membership fees. Given that we -- you know us, we tend to be long-term focused and when things are very strong over there, we want to keep pushing for even more memberships. We have the added benefit in most countries of being the only club operator, and we'll continue to use that benefit to look at it. But we're not in any hurry to do that.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just lastly, on the expense leverage or expense deleverage in the quarter. I mean, obviously, FX is hurting it a little bit, but where do you think sort of the level is this year for expense leverage in terms of the comp? Where you need to be on a reported basis? Closer to 5?\n\n---\n\nWell, I mean, I think -- I think so, recognizing nothing's perfect. When you take those things that I pointed out and that, in the aggregate, were 5 basis points. I mean, and not trying to be cute here, but there's always those things that add up or offset each other. And this quarter, year-over-year, they didn't. That's 5 of it. The other thing is the biggest impact to our numbers were in those first 4 weeks. It's a combination of things. I think probably, we budgeted a little aggressively. Our numbers were still not bad for December for that 4-week period. And it was 4, 5 less Christmas shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, just based on how Thanksgiving falls, that fell this year. The other thing is that some of the -- FX had a little less to do with it because that affects all the line items, both sales and the margin dollars. But I think some of it also is, while sales overall were satisfactory, they were a little less unsatisfactory in things like certain nonfood seasonal categories or like-for-like, and a little stronger in fresh foods. So again, as we mentioned, fresh foods margins were down more. And then you had the double whammy in some of the nonfood categories. So on the level of sales that we have now, those types of things make a big difference. And again I think, overall, our margins were a lower than we had planned, but some of it we're very conscious of, as you know, in some of the fresh food areas. And getting back to the leverage question, yes, I think a 4 to 5 should be able to do it but we had a few anomalies this quarter as well.\n\n---\n\nSo Richard, I wanted to drill down a little bit on the fresh food category. The margin pressure, is that -- how broad-based is that? Or is that a handful of items? And what could you call out among items? And then is that more you making proactive investments or delaying price pass-through?\n\n---\n\nIt's more almost all us. I would say it's aggressively, it is all us. And in terms of where it is, as you might expect, it's particularly in the proteins. We talked about chickens before. We've held the price on that chicken and it's -- those 65 million or 70 million rotisserie chickens are just part of the chicken. I mean, it's also frozen and fresh. And we are seeing a little relief in some of the pricing there and some of the costing. And that's just starting. I think it's starting a little later than we had anticipated 6 months ago, but we should see a little bit of relief there. Really beyond that, I don't hear -- meat's very competitive and meat's at an all-time high in some categories. But that's a premium to everybody. Beyond that, sometimes in produce we have a little issue. Even though produce was the strongest, it depends when it hits. And with some of the shortages, that's impacted us a little bit. But overall, I'd say meat, pork and poultry is the biggest culprit there, and it's mostly us.\n\n---\n\nAnd as a follow-up to that, when you look at having some more consistent markups than others, how do you guys think about strategically, right, because of your strength in perishables, we can or should operate with a somewhat lower margin because we get that traffic right, which then feeds into all of the higher ticket nonfoods that you might sell? Is that holistic of an approach or not really?\n\n---\n\nWell, that's part of the approach, but again, without trying to be too granular here, clearly, the comment about how the impact of margins and P&L of course, in the first 4 weeks versus the subsequent 8 weeks, that was dramatic. And part of that again was seasonal markdowns, both being aggressive and proactive and then a little less sales in some areas. While TVs, overall, I think in the quarter were pretty good, you've got other areas. Cameras, industry-wise, are down quite a bit as you might expect, with everybody using smartphones. Laptops and desktops as well. So there's some of that pressure. And then I really think that we probably budgeted a little off, given the 5 days -- the 5 fewer days. But at the end of the day, it's hard to know what it is, other that I can tell you is a heck of a lot more of it was in those first 4 weeks. And so trend-wise, that's good but that doesn't tell you anything about the upcoming quarter other than what we know, that February was a little impacted by weather. So we're starting off the quarter in those first 2 weeks, the last 2 weeks of February, which is the first 2 weeks of Q3 were just really...\n\n---\n\nAnd then lastly, would you say when you look at either gross margin or fresh food or some of the individual categories, I imagine there is a fair bit of difference country-to-country or not? And is there more pressure outside the U.S. or less?\n\n---\n\nI'd say overall, there's a lot less pressure outside the U.S. I mean, the U.S. is clearly the most competitive with regard to the club business, as well as competitive with -- supermarkets are probably the most competitive in the U.S. compared to major chains everywhere. So certainly, that's the case. But U.S. is 70 -- a little over 70% of our company.\n\n---\n\nJust to follow up on the last question. When you think about the progression of your margin performance and it getting better throughout the quarter, the hardline margin is getting better I guess intuitively makes sense as you move away from the holiday markdowns, but I was wondering if you could discuss I guess if that's the case? And then two, was the same true for fresh foods? Did margins in that category also improve as you progressed throughout 2Q?\n\n---\n\nI believe they did a little bit. But again, as you know, we're all about being competitive out there and being proactive in that and -- but we also want to make money and we want to, hopefully, show some improving margins. But we're going to do what's right each day on pricing, irrespective of how it's going to make margin that day. But overall, clearly, we look at the first 4 weeks and we took some actions, I'm not going to tell you where, but it showed some relative improvement. And that, we feel good about. But again, this quarter's a new quarter and other than sales starting off a little weaker, we'll see where it goes. And a lot that, I think, is weather. I mean, we all got crammed in the Midwest and the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic, the rain last week -- I'm not trying to make excuses, but it's been unbelievable. Japan, we had several locations actually closed for a few days with the snow, the worst snow they've ever had. So lots of little things, and I'll try to not remind you next year we chose a little better [indiscernible] to those things.\n\n---\n\nAll right. And just a follow-up to Dan's question earlier. I mean, when you sit down with the board every month and every quarter, I guess, what exactly is the pushback to unleashing your balance sheet in getting more aggressive? And what's the thought process currently amongst the board?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think it's a topic that we always talk about. I don't think there's a pushback either way. As you know, we did the 3 -- a little over $3 billion payout for the shareholders via the special dividend last year, as the stock was ever-increasingly strong. As I noted in a couple of the analyst, before the market opened comments, we've been a little under consensus expectations although that's not our direction. And clearly, Q2 was a larger gap there. So again, I think my comments that we plan to buy some this quarter is a step in that direction. I don't want to be coy or cute about it, but we'll let you know in a quarter. But we will be buying some, and we'll go from there. I think the board is, as you know, we've never looked at it as let's do this because it'll be a positive message to the market but long-term I think the board, as I am, are positive about our company. And certainly it is accretive, but at the same token, we try to be judicious about it. And perhaps we've been a little conservative but we also had the $3 billion dividend that we divest in December that helped us be a little conservative and I think you'll see that change some.\n\n---\n\nOkay, good. And then just my last question and I'll pass it on is just on pricing investments, I know you guys have been doing it religiously for as long as I can remember. I'm wondering with some of the new technologies that you're putting in place, are you studying it a little bit more closely? Do you feel like the elasticity is there to justify the increase in price investments by the U.S.?\n\n---\n\nWe would never look at it that way. We're out there -- I think, again, getting back to the simple [indiscernible] example. It's not unlike the hot dog example of years gone by. When prices went up, we just saw that as the strength of that and the growth in the number of chickens we're selling that gets people in. We don't study and say what if we took it to $5.49, and we'd have this many fewer shops or whatever. We know it's the right thing to do. And again I think Q4, I mean, Q2 in that first 4-week period, it exacerbates everything because you had all those things, some weaker sales in some bigger-ticket items, some margins on top of the ongoing fresh foods margins. And I'm very emphatic about the fact that our fresh foods margins are us, our pricing, and we'll see some improvement there but we'll do it when we feel good about it.\n\n---\n\nJust to go back to the comments you made about expenses. If you can just help us provide a little bit more clarity on how we should think about that going forward, maybe an update on where you are on kind of the IT modernization process, anything else of note on health care, payroll and some of the other items.\n\n---\n\nWell, on IT, I think now it's been about 6 quarters that I've mentioned it. And it's probably, on average, over the 6 quarters -- I don't have them in front of me, about 4 basis point, and so quarters 5 and 6 in this process, or 4 on top of 4 or 3 on top of 5 or whatever. So -- and that will probably continue for another half-dozen quarters. It's a 5 or so year effort, with at least a 3-year buildup in those types of things. There'll be some quarters, on a year-over-year basis, when it's a couple of basis points. There must be some one that's 4 or 5, depending on when systems are being input. But we have a lot going on. We're excited about -- the user groups are excited about some of the things they're seeing. We're going to start implementing some of the components of it starting in the early summer to late summer. Again, I'm not going to try to be cute or coy here, it will take some time but we've got a lot going on. And again, part of that is the fact that for 25 years, we pride ourselves with having very simple systems. And they're still simple, probably, relative to others, relative to the entire effort. And again so far, so good. But we're 1.5 years into it. And so that's going to still hit us for at least another year, maybe even longer on that line. Beyond that, in terms of SG&A, a lot -- something -- that's just how the numbers work in terms of the fact that you've got FX, a lower weighted average of countries where some of the payroll percent -- as a percent of sales in those respective countries and certainly, the health care as a percent of sales in those countries is a little lower weighted average when you've got -- with the Canada rate down 8% year-over-year to Canada exchange rates. We've got Japan in Q2 down 15% with Japan yen. In Australia, it's down 14.5% year-over-year in the second quarter. So all those things add a little insult to injury. The underlying numbers, they were a little worse in terms of percent -- expense percentages, but big chunks for this were the things that I mentioned.  And again there's lots of little things and they all seem to hit at the same time, on top of the fact that in the quarter where you get a lot of leverage, the 4-week period where you get a lot of leverage was a little weaker than planned.\n\n---\n\nUnderstood. And then, if you can just comment on kind of inflation, deflation what you're seeing across various categories, just how we should think about LIFO if you think that will still be a factor in 3Q like we saw here in the second quarter.\n\n---\n\nWell, if I look at the -- compared to year-end, just our entire LIFO pool, at mid-year, it's up about 0.25%. So just like cost of all items. There was $100 item that we paid for, $100 for -- at September 1, if you will. At February 16, we were paying, on average, $100.25. As you'd expect, there's some deflationary pools like computers and what have you. You've got probably the most inflation in food and sundries, a little over 1%. You've got a shade of gas inflation, although that's ticking down right now a little bit. So it doesn't seem -- overall, there doesn't seem to be a lot of inflation. But on a $4-plus billion LIFO -- and LIFO is a U.S. concept only. So on a $4-plus billion, I don't know, probably $5 billion LIFO pool, 1% would be $50 million, 0.25% would be $12.5 million. I don't think it should be a lot. And I don't have in front of me last year's LIFO numbers for Q3 and 4. I thought I did. Right there -- not to disclose[ph] anything, but in Q3 and 4 -- only so much you can -- last year, in Q3 and 4, LIFO was a credit, a benefit of about $8 million -- $7.5 million and $8 million in each of Q3 and 4. So if it is a little inflationary, we'll see that same kind of -- a similar kind of swing that we saw in Q2, but we'll wait and see. Mind you when there's a LIFO charge, there's probably -- that's again, I look at a combination of that with a quarter or 2 because they tend to work, not always, but in tandem. One opposing the other. But not a lot of inflation.\n\n---\n\nSo 2 questions. First, as you model out FX at the end of the period, when do you think that the FX might stop turning to sort of a flat scenario, the total comp versus the core comps?\n\n---\n\nThat is -- I don't know, and I'm not even a student of some of this FedEx -- of this foreign exchange stuff. But when you see, as an example, in Japan first quarter year-over-year was down 20%. Second quarter year-over-year, it was down 15% for us in terms of the Japanese yen. So there's been a lot of weakening. At some point, it's going to bounce back a little bit, but I can't tell you when. Canada has been awfully strong for many years, and it's now subsiding a little bit. But who knows? And then add to that the craziness of the world events that could impact these numbers. Usually, when there's issues going on, world issues going on, the dollar strengthens. And I think that's a little bit of what's happening now but also, particularly in the case of Canada, I remember 20 years ago when the Canadian dollar was CAD 0.65 on the U.S. dollar and it actually gotten above CAD 1 on the U.S. dollar, and it's come down a little bit. So it kind of bounced off of that peak, but I can't tell you when that's going to be.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just as a follow-up. The ancillary business, the margins in that business had been a positive for quite some time, and it looks like if I got the numbers right, it was flat this quarter. What piece of the business is changing? And is there anything you could say about the outlook?\n\n---\n\nA lot of it has to do with gas deflation, just the weighted average of that chunk. Mind you, gas -- gasoline sales as a percent of our company total sales is 11% or 12%. And so it's a huge chunk, and we've got gas deflation. That alone -- and gas -- people will say our reporting gross margin is in the whatever, 10.5% plus range, 10% to 11% range. Within that number, gas is in the 1% to 5% range every quarter. So that weighted average coming down has an impact on that number. So you've got to look at it both ways. Overall, ancillary businesses were fine. Our pharmacy business continues strong. Our hearing aid business, although small, is very strong. 1 hour photo, as you would expect, continues to be a little weaker because of -- nobody takes as many pictures. But we did a little creative over there, they tried to do a few other things. But it's still very profitable but not as profitable as it used to be. So if you add it all up, gas deflation was probably the biggest reason.\n\n---\n\nYou gave us some additional detail this quarter on the 4-week versus the 8-week, and I want to make sure we got the right impression from this. Given you said that the margins, if I heard this right, on hardlines and fresh foods being down 30 to 50, does that mean that at the remaining 8 weeks of the quarter you would have actually had gross margins up overall? And is it a fair impression that without those first 4 weeks, your earnings are closer to the double-digit type growth range?\n\n---\n\nIt was -- in the first 4 weeks, one of the things we talked about in the press release was this -- those hardline categories, that was impactful in the first 4 weeks, whereas, fresh foods is more, again, us and -- contributed in the quarter. The 30 to 50 range for those types of categories that were down year-over-year was for the entire quarter. I don't have the detail by period here but directionally I would think, given the 4 -- first 4 weeks was worse, it clearly showed some improvement.\n\n---\n\nAll right. Has Costco done market research looking at the number of your members that also have an Amazon prime membership? And do your merchants have any sense for how much this might be impacting spending at Costco? Do you think that might have been a bigger factor on the holidays with gift-giving or do you think it's not a material change?\n\n---\n\nActually, I think some of you guys out there do more surveying of that than we do. Honestly, I've read some research out there that talks about the overlap. There is overlap. My guess is, clearly, in areas like the books and CDs, that's a changed business over the last many years. TVs, frankly, were not bad overall. And particularly if you had our e-commerce too are in line, were up a shade for the quarter. I can't tell you what happened in the 4 weeks of February because they were, what we call, majors or electronics was down in the mid-single digits year-over-year. But for overall, we probably fared better than most in-line, and all that stuff takes away a little bit. We're looking at ways to get, as we have now for a while, to get younger people here in as well. We recognize that, and we'll continue to do that. So that -- I know the answer is no, there's not a lot of discernible concern at this point in time.\n\n---\n\nI'll start by just jumping off of from the last question about trying to get younger people into the warehouses. Can you talk a little bit about what it is you have done or would consider doing to make that happen? What tools do you have?\n\n---\n\nWell, first and foremost, we're not going to do anything rash, but we're also not going to have our head in the sand here. I mean, one of the things -- the test, as an example, with Google, among several retailers in the Bay Area has been interesting. I'm not going to, again, talk about any detail yet. We've done a few things with some of the social media things out there. One of the impacts, which is what we do, is the rise of organic. It's a big business. It's growing fast. We can actually show a better savings on those bigger-ticket price point items. And we see that time and again, whether it's organic ground beef or those giant packs of kale or you name it -- and milk. I mean, we're doing huge business in that. That I think also is driving in some younger people. Some of the -- one of the first systems going in our modernization effort is a new membership system, which we'll start rolling out in the U.S. I believe June, July. And again, there'll be a lot more bells and whistles but as you know, our systems have been pretty basic and primitive. And we're not going to go crazy overnight on it. But we're doing a few things and if it works, and we'll keep doing some of those things. So that's what I can tell you at this point.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then I just have a sort of bigger-picture question. It's obviously that it's your philosophy to pick -- provide very great value, especially in fresh foods to your customers and you'll absorb some inflation. But what do you do, I mean, everything I see -- meat has been inflationary for a while, especially beef. Do you have to sit down and think about your strategy if it looks like there are items that are just going to be inflationary for the long term?\n\n---\n\nWell, part of the answer's no. We do what we do, and part of it though is that we also recognize that we need to -- our goal is just to maximize shareholder value and ultimately, that turns into long-term driving earnings. And -- but we're not going to necessarily do something in the short term or in a given quarter to do that. Again, looking at Q2, it was a combination of -- we -- I think I probably said, 6 or 9 months ago using the simple chicken example, that there seem to be in the few months looking forward 6 to 9 months ago, that poultry pricing costing was going to improve, which would improve our margins because we were not lowering the price, we'd just not raised it prior to that. That's finally starting to happen. So those are the kinds of things that we'll do. Strategically at the end of the day, we've got to show improvement in bottom line. Ultimately, it's not going to come from 10% and 15% comps for the company. We're going to have good comps but at the levels that we have and assuming they're still going to be better than others, it's still going to require some margin over time, and we look at that. But we're not terribly concerned about how it impacts the given quarter. And so we -- organic helps. The fact of the matter is -- I think I mentioned this as an example, and one of things that, again, talks about the younger members' wealth. What we found is, when we tried fresh organic ground beef, I think in the first year, we did $25-plus million in an item or 2. This is at a higher price point and a greater savings and a fair margin for us, a better margin for us relative to the more competitive regular ground beef. The cool thing was that 80% of those sales were existing -- were members that had not bought ground beef with us before. They love Costco, but they are organic. On average, I would say they tend to be a little younger, I don't -- that's my guess. And so those are the kinds of things that I think are going to help us a little too. The fact that increasing penetration of our company is overseas, over time, notwithstanding the weak exchange rates this quarter, we generally tend to have a little higher margin overseas, where you don't have -- wherever you -- even in U.S., when you don't have a direct competitor in the market a mile away or less, you're going to have a little better margin. And so all those things I think should impact us positively and -- but we're not going to change what we do in terms of occasionally identifying those key items that we're just not going to budge on.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then one final question, which is kind of related, but you obviously saw softness in some hardline categories. Your electronics has been bad for a while. Do you think at all that you have to rethink how you, the products that you're offering because of that? Is there something else that you would be more aggressive on? Would you take space away? How are you thinking about that longer term?\n\n---\n\nWell, as you know, electronics is what greets you when you walk into a Costco. Certainly, the online is part of that. We do a strong business online. Part of it is just because they're bigger, not only bigger-ticket, but bulkier, physical, bulky items. We have a white glove alternative, with installation as well. And so that business is growing. But getting people in the door at Costco, we sell a heck of a lot of TVs as well that way. But again, you have a few unusual things happening right now. Cameras, I understand cameras are down 30-plus percent in the industry. We're not that different. In fact, we've got a lot -- that was very successful and still a big volume business, but that's been weak year-over-year in a bigger way for the first time. Desktops and laptops, we're starting to get some traction on pads, on tablets of late. But I think that's a business -- it'll be tough when we're -- I don't think we're necessarily rethinking allocation of space. If anything, it's still a strong area for us, but it got hammered a little bit over that Christmas selling season. Again, a lot of it wasn't TV, so some of those were other items.\n\n---\n\nTwo follow-up questions. The first, just on the gas deflation that you're now starting to see. Can you remind us, does it -- historically, does it impact your traffic trends as gas in general if it does get very deflationary and come down a lot, does it -- do you have to find other ways to keep -- drive that traffic comp?\n\n---\n\nInterestingly, when prices are coming down, we actually historically save the member a little more because we turn it so fast, and so we're buying everyday, if you will. And the guy down the street's buying it every 6 or 8 days or 9 days. And so when it's going up, it's costing us a little more when we're competitive. We are still the lowest-priced, hopefully, but there's a little less savings. There's a little less news about it out there. And so I think overall, on a macro basis, when prices are coming down, even though we're saving the customer a little more, it's less newsworthy. The fact that it's not on the nightly news. And so it's probably a little less positive there. But given how big we are in that business now, it's not as impactful either way.\n\n---\n\nGot you. And just a different question. Could you remind us, with your international business how you're thinking about new markets? I think France, you've mentioned before. Any update on timing of when you could open a new country?\n\n---\n\nWell, Spain is April or May? May. And France is hopefully about 1.5 years. And beyond that, we haven't disclosed anything. In terms of how, there's generally I mean, the 3 likely areas, in no order, is other parts of Europe, South America and China. And we haven't really stated beyond France and Spain what our plans are beyond that, nor do we plan to discuss that right now.\n\n---\n\nThis is Steve Tanal on for Matt Fassler. Just a quick one on gross margins. It sounds like much of the year-on-year decrease was sort of intentional or through price investments, if you will. And we just want to know how to think about that going forward? In the next few quarters, at a minimum, to do you think the trend's likely to sort of stay in this way or how are you guys thinking about that near term?\n\n---\n\nWell, first of all, let me correct -- maybe with all the different numbers going around here, in terms of Q2, fresh was intentional. The rest of it was not intentional. Some of it's promotional. Some of it just we do what we do to have clean inventories took some extra seasonal markdowns in some areas, including a little bit of electronics. And some of it -- so some of it was that. So in terms of the trends going forward, again, I've alluded to the fact that we're starting to see a little better costing on the poultry side. Meat continues to be competitive and rising. And then on -- beyond that, I can't tell you a whole lot. But a big chunk -- again, produce -- meat, not produce. Fresh foods was our proactive aggressiveness. The rest of it is doing what we do and responding to competition and responding to -- we see being a little weaker and getting rid of stuff.\n\n---\n\nUnderstood. That's very helpful, actually. And just on the membership fees, we seem to underestimate the impact of FX there, but it also does seem like -- as I think about FX and the overall comp, you guys talked about sort of a 2-percentage-point drag. It looks like it was more like 3 on member fees. Is there anything you could sort of help us as we think about the split there, international versus U.S. and how to get that right going forward?\n\n---\n\nIt's -- I think the biggest impact FX-wise was in Canada, which is 10%, 12% of our company. And I think a higher -- a strong penetration in Executive Memberships, which is the higher fee. So those things probably pushed it a little bit. In terms of guessing, in the future, your guess is as good as mine.\n\n---\n\nUnderstood, understood. And just to confirm this, there were no buybacks in the second quarter, correct? And you guys are intending to buy back in the third quarter?\n\n---\n\nCorrect.\n\n---\n\nI just got 2 questions for you. The first one is, can you comment a little bit -- Canada was strong for you fundamentally. Can you just talk a little bit about the market, what's going on there with Costco's positioning? And the second question is can you just give us an update on the private label initiative in Kirkland Signature and sort of new products or new categories that you guys are excited about looking forward.\n\n---\n\nOh, Canada's strong. I mean Canada, thankfully, is not only that we're the only club in town, which is a positive, it has everything good in it, historically, in the last several years, everything good about it. It has a good economy. It didn't have the financial crisis issues that the U.S. had. It's got a -- of course, a part of its economy is natural resource based, which has been on fire. So those are all positive things. It has lower health care expenses as a percent of sales just by the nature of the health care up there versus here. And so all those things have been positive for us. And again, though, when you've got an 8% decline year-over-year in currency, that washes that away in terms of how we report it for February. In terms of private label, I think some of the areas, apparel has been one that's -- that used, I think, to be exciting. I've talked ad nauseum in the past about in the last year about the wool slack. We've got a great gabardine slack now that's I think $19.99. We -- I know we have some additional women's athletic items. And so we're doing -- that'll be an area, I think, that will continue to grow for us. On the food side, organic. We're doing some -- a few more items. And in a lot of places, it'll continue to grow. And I think what probably over time we haven't appreciated is the strength of it not only in the U.S. or in Canada, both these items being able to take to other countries where, when we take a regular branded international item to that country, we showed incredible savings where prices have always been high. On these items, given the quality level and the pricing, the strength is I think exacerbated even more and that's a positive.\n\n---\n\nMost of my questions been asked, but just a quick one on February. Just, you made the decision to call out weather and the impact there. Was the weather materially different than what you saw in January? And I mean, I know you kind of said there were some stuff that happened in Japan. Is that what kind of tipped it because in the U.S., it just feels like kind of January, February were basically pretty similar.\n\n---\n\nWell, you probably live in that area. It was more severe in February. As an example, just for the last week of February, the Southwest got hammered with rain for 5 days. Japan was -- to the company, was just another insult to injury, if you will. I mean, I think we have what, 18 units in Japan? I don't have the exact detail in front of me. Let's assume half a dozen or 6 or 8 of them were impacted in the Tokyo market. So again, that was just a little bit more but overall, yes, it was more extensive than we've seen before.\n\n---\n\nThat's good color. And then just on the club openings, looks like you're going to kind of get to that 30 kind of gross number this year that you guys were hoping for. What about as we look to next year, I mean, you think you can -- you're still confident you can get that number north of 30?\n\n---\n\nYes. Yes, I mean Craig's goal, Craig and Jeff Brotman's goal is to get into that low 30, 30-plus range. I'm sure now that I've said it, we'll get 28 or 29. But at the end of the day, we're shooting for 30 to 35 a year for the next 5 years.\n\n---\n\nRichard, I had 2 questions. First, on electronics and then on membership. You've mentioned it was up but then you listed some categories like cameras and such that were all down. Was it just TVs that drove CE, and was that ASP or volume?\n\n---\n\nExcuse me, what? Tablets were part of it. Also the quarter overall was different than February. February was a little weaker in electronics. The biggest chunk is TVs just by volume, and so -- and that's partly why February -- TVs were weaker in February relatively speaking than they were for the quarter when they were actually about flat. And I think the average sale price is about flat. It had been up. Bob's saying it's up. I have this -- out here. Hold on. I could tell you. In the second quarter, the average price point looks like it was up a couple of percent, and that's probably because we're selling bigger-ticket, bigger TVs, Smarter TV. And by the way, one of the comments that I heard in the budget meeting last week was that the rollout of the next-generation of technology in TVs has been a little bit delayed, and it's going to be in a few months, April instead of January. I'm being coached here. And so again, that should help it a little bit, but we'll see.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Great. Well, I don't think you need any coaching for the next question. On memberships, just want to make sure I'm getting this right. We finally have a quarter that's telling in terms of the fee increase.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nSo if we're up 7...\n\n---\n\nIn local currency.\n\n---\n\nIs it fair to say that in the U.S. while membership renewals are great, and you have that -- the mix towards Executive, that memberships per club in the U.S. is actually trending down a little bit. And if that's the case, has that shifted at all?\n\n---\n\nI don't have that detail here. I'd have to look. I -- to the extent that we've opened 14 or so U.S. warehouses, it may be a little bit. But actually, it's -- I don't know if I'm correct on that. I have to look.\n\n---\n\nOkay. We can follow-up on it. But conceptually, you still have the mix shift going on to Executive.\n\n---\n\nYes. By the way, one of the things is -- I'll give you an example. We opened in -- just a couple of -- 3 years ago in Huntington Beach, California, in L.A. We have 50-plus percent of the households or more in that maybe greater L.A. market where we've got 40 or so locations. We may open up in a new market there with the 8 to 15 weeks prior to opening, you sign up for tabling activities. As of opening day, we might have 5,000 or less new members. New members. In the meantime, that's a unit that may very well -- will exceed our company average for the first year with -- do 150 million, 100 million of which is new and 50 million which is cannibalized. So you've got members that are closer, that are going to shop more frequently for the first time. Contrast that in Asia where, again, during those 8 to 15 weeks prior to opening, as of opening day, we see numbers in the 25,000 to 50,000 new member sign-ups, with a bigger renewal -- a lower renewal rate but, nonetheless, so that should be a big difference. So my guess is that yes, it could be flat or down slightly, but that would be expected in that example.\n\n---\n\nI'll be quick since it's the end of the call. Just wanted to follow up on the inflation question and produce inflation, deflation and whatnot, with the potential of some inflation working into produce, you guys investing in price there. How is that going to work through as we work through the next, say, quarter or 2 if we can get some spikes in produce inflation. How does that work through your numbers?\n\n---\n\nMy guess, it would help a little unlike -- meat is so much more -- as in general, meat is consumed more out there. Produce, everybody's got different items, different pack sizes, different qualities. And we could still show great savings, but it's just not, in my view, it's just not the same type of level of competition. So I don't think that's going to impact us as more -- that, that will impact us as much. The big thing in produce is when there's a drought or a freeze and when -- we're doing hundreds of millions of dollars of items, be it strawberries or blueberries and when, in a given month, you did $5 million in an item instead of $15 million during a holiday item or if that plateaus because of the freeze, that's more impactful than composition.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just one last one that's more, a little  bit more strategic. And if you don't want to take it, you can always talk off-line. But as you guys expand internationally that becomes much more focus than the growth. And we've seen other retailers try this and it has worked well. It's working well for you guys. But just talk about the structure a little bit you're putting in place to make sure that you kind of keep momentum up overseas.\n\n---\n\nWell, first and foremost, we start in any country with existing employees that are from our company. The woman running Spain is a seasoned Operations person, Executive from Canada for many, many years. The guy running Taiwan goes back to the Price Club days in Southern California. And the guy running Korea started as a Warehouse Manager at Costco. And before that, I believe [indiscernible]. So -- but when we go over there to -- when we go over, we send a core group of half a dozen people, 3 or 4 people to merchandising operations. I think the biggest thing to make sure everybody's on the same page is these individuals travel to Seattle every 4 weeks. So 13 times a year for 1.5 days budget meeting and they're typically there for an extra day doing some other operations or merchandising specific meetings. And then like Jim, for many years, Craig and others are traveling to those countries often. Craig's out of the country today. And so the biggest way we do it I think is everybody being on the same page. The other thing is, I'll give you a good example, when asked before why have we've been so successful in several countries, including some of these countries in Asia. We think part of it is, is not only is our value proposition more extreme over there, and also that people actually do like big American stuff. The fact is, is that some of these private label items that we're developing now have been huge successes in some of these other countries. And those U.S.-sourced goods, and so I think all those things play well into our hand. But that's going to change over time. And so we do what we do best is we're constantly focused on it. I mean, when these heads of countries and different countries come to Seattle every 4 weeks, one of the things that each of the senior VPs of Operations around -- and every country has 1, Canada has 2 and the U.S. has 8. But all those foreign ones, they come here and one of the things that they report on is what initiatives in terms of global sourcing, procuring goods from a multinational manufacturer where the U.S. buys a heck of a lot from. Perhaps, Canada does because we're big and have been around a long time. But because of whatever it is, the licensing arrangement or regional pressure on their side, it's a work in progress that we're making good success there. All those things, they're little things, but they help us every day. So I think that'll continue. It's really a lot of that blocking and tackling, and we have -- just like we did when we went to Alaska for the first time and to Hawaii for the first time, we feel that we've really lowered prices in those markets and made it more competitive, but we still shine better competitively versus other retail formats. Given the fact that in some of these countries pricing has been a lot higher, and I think that has helped us. And in bringing goods, whether it's the jumbo cashews or the fresh blueberries to countries where they're buying a lot more of it.\n\n---\n\nI just wanted to clarify, maybe you said this and I missed it, but when you talked about the 30 to 50 basis points of gross margin impact, how much of that would have been sort of the responsive price cuts versus proactive?\n\n---\n\nWell, I guess there's 3 things you're talking about, I can't tell you exactly. I know in fresh foods it's us just wanting to keep the price where it is on key items and doing what we do. If you think about, let's take hardlines or let's take whether it's electronics or clothes or whatever, if sales are a little soft, we're proactive to mark things down to get rid of them before the season ends. Structurally, we have the benefit I think of being in and out of seasons early, but that doesn't mean we still don't have to take some excess markdowns sometimes. In terms of responsive, I would say proactive is more impactful than responsive, the issue of being responsive. But there's some responsive, too, out there.\n\n---\n\nAnd is that -- do you see any changes in the competitive landscape, and where is it coming from?\n\n---\n\nNo. We really haven't. I mean, there's still a lot of tough competition out there. Yes, we wish that -- part of the challenge with the Internet and delivery. Is delivery included, and what extra things? I think we've -- we're getting a little better at communicating what's the value in our product in terms of an extra Controller or whatever it is or the shipping and because when we do price shop, the least competitive ones are some of those that are on the Internet. And I don't mean to name names.\n\n---\n\nJust wanted to ask you competitively, I've seen a lot from your other big major club competitor out there lately in terms of testing some stuff with online membership or being a little more aggressive in different countries. And I'm just wondering if you guys are seeing any impact of that or any pressure or just how you're dealing with kind of the competitive issues.\n\n---\n\nWell, in terms of direct club competition, no. I mean, they did-- I believe Sam's did a fee increase that they tested originally in Texas, and they've rolled that out now in the U.S. They're only, by the way, in the U.S. and Mexico. But we have not seen any -- Sam's is very competitive but we haven't seen any giant changes in that or us needing to respond to something that they have done.\n\n---\n\nWell, thank you, everyone, and look forward to chatting in 12 weeks. Have a good day.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nI was wondering if you could just discuss a little bit of your current thoughts on buyback. And then separate question, any thoughts on international membership fees and whether or not they do feel a hike or not?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, in terms of buyback, again, while we let you guys know once a quarter when we have our quarterly earnings announcement, our intention is to start buying back stock this quarter. We continue to look at it, but I think it's a good statement to say that we will be buying something this quarter. As it relates to international, we're always looking at membership fees. Given that we -- you know us, we tend to be long-term focused and when things are very strong over there, we want to keep pushing for even more memberships. We have the added benefit in most countries of being the only club operator, and we'll continue to use that benefit to look at it. But we're not in any hurry to do that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nAnd then just lastly, on the expense leverage or expense deleverage in the quarter. I mean, obviously, FX is hurting it a little bit, but where do you think sort of the level is this year for expense leverage in terms of the comp? Where you need to be on a reported basis? Closer to 5?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, I mean, I think -- I think so, recognizing nothing's perfect. When you take those things that I pointed out and that, in the aggregate, were 5 basis points. I mean, and not trying to be cute here, but there's always those things that add up or offset each other. And this quarter, year-over-year, they didn't. That's 5 of it. The other thing is the biggest impact to our numbers were in those first 4 weeks. It's a combination of things. I think probably, we budgeted a little aggressively. Our numbers were still not bad for December for that 4-week period. And it was 4, 5 less Christmas shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, just based on how Thanksgiving falls, that fell this year. The other thing is that some of the -- FX had a little less to do with it because that affects all the line items, both sales and the margin dollars. But I think some of it also is, while sales overall were satisfactory, they were a little less unsatisfactory in things like certain nonfood seasonal categories or like-for-like, and a little stronger in fresh foods. So again, as we mentioned, fresh foods margins were down more. And then you had the double whammy in some of the nonfood categories. So on the level of sales that we have now, those types of things make a big difference. And again I think, overall, our margins were a lower than we had planned, but some of it we're very conscious of, as you know, in some of the fresh food areas. And getting back to the leverage question, yes, I think a 4 to 5 should be able to do it but we had a few anomalies this quarter as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nSo Richard, I wanted to drill down a little bit on the fresh food category. The margin pressure, is that -- how broad-based is that? Or is that a handful of items? And what could you call out among items? And then is that more you making proactive investments or delaying price pass-through?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nIt's more almost all us. I would say it's aggressively, it is all us. And in terms of where it is, as you might expect, it's particularly in the proteins. We talked about chickens before. We've held the price on that chicken and it's -- those 65 million or 70 million rotisserie chickens are just part of the chicken. I mean, it's also frozen and fresh. And we are seeing a little relief in some of the pricing there and some of the costing. And that's just starting. I think it's starting a little later than we had anticipated 6 months ago, but we should see a little bit of relief there. Really beyond that, I don't hear -- meat's very competitive and meat's at an all-time high in some categories. But that's a premium to everybody. Beyond that, sometimes in produce we have a little issue. Even though produce was the strongest, it depends when it hits. And with some of the shortages, that's impacted us a little bit. But overall, I'd say meat, pork and poultry is the biggest culprit there, and it's mostly us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nAnd as a follow-up to that, when you look at having some more consistent markups than others, how do you guys think about strategically, right, because of your strength in perishables, we can or should operate with a somewhat lower margin because we get that traffic right, which then feeds into all of the higher ticket nonfoods that you might sell? Is that holistic of an approach or not really?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, that's part of the approach, but again, without trying to be too granular here, clearly, the comment about how the impact of margins and P&L of course, in the first 4 weeks versus the subsequent 8 weeks, that was dramatic. And part of that again was seasonal markdowns, both being aggressive and proactive and then a little less sales in some areas. While TVs, overall, I think in the quarter were pretty good, you've got other areas. Cameras, industry-wise, are down quite a bit as you might expect, with everybody using smartphones. Laptops and desktops as well. So there's some of that pressure. And then I really think that we probably budgeted a little off, given the 5 days -- the 5 fewer days. But at the end of the day, it's hard to know what it is, other that I can tell you is a heck of a lot more of it was in those first 4 weeks. And so trend-wise, that's good but that doesn't tell you anything about the upcoming quarter other than what we know, that February was a little impacted by weather. So we're starting off the quarter in those first 2 weeks, the last 2 weeks of February, which is the first 2 weeks of Q3 were just really...\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nAnd then lastly, would you say when you look at either gross margin or fresh food or some of the individual categories, I imagine there is a fair bit of difference country-to-country or not? And is there more pressure outside the U.S. or less?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI'd say overall, there's a lot less pressure outside the U.S. I mean, the U.S. is clearly the most competitive with regard to the club business, as well as competitive with -- supermarkets are probably the most competitive in the U.S. compared to major chains everywhere. So certainly, that's the case. But U.S. is 70 -- a little over 70% of our company.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nJust to follow up on the last question. When you think about the progression of your margin performance and it getting better throughout the quarter, the hardline margin is getting better I guess intuitively makes sense as you move away from the holiday markdowns, but I was wondering if you could discuss I guess if that's the case? And then two, was the same true for fresh foods? Did margins in that category also improve as you progressed throughout 2Q?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI believe they did a little bit. But again, as you know, we're all about being competitive out there and being proactive in that and -- but we also want to make money and we want to, hopefully, show some improving margins. But we're going to do what's right each day on pricing, irrespective of how it's going to make margin that day. But overall, clearly, we look at the first 4 weeks and we took some actions, I'm not going to tell you where, but it showed some relative improvement. And that, we feel good about. But again, this quarter's a new quarter and other than sales starting off a little weaker, we'll see where it goes. And a lot that, I think, is weather. I mean, we all got crammed in the Midwest and the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic, the rain last week -- I'm not trying to make excuses, but it's been unbelievable. Japan, we had several locations actually closed for a few days with the snow, the worst snow they've ever had. So lots of little things, and I'll try to not remind you next year we chose a little better [indiscernible] to those things.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nAll right. And just a follow-up to Dan's question earlier. I mean, when you sit down with the board every month and every quarter, I guess, what exactly is the pushback to unleashing your balance sheet in getting more aggressive? And what's the thought process currently amongst the board?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, I think it's a topic that we always talk about. I don't think there's a pushback either way. As you know, we did the 3 -- a little over $3 billion payout for the shareholders via the special dividend last year, as the stock was ever-increasingly strong. As I noted in a couple of the analyst, before the market opened comments, we've been a little under consensus expectations although that's not our direction. And clearly, Q2 was a larger gap there. So again, I think my comments that we plan to buy some this quarter is a step in that direction. I don't want to be coy or cute about it, but we'll let you know in a quarter. But we will be buying some, and we'll go from there. I think the board is, as you know, we've never looked at it as let's do this because it'll be a positive message to the market but long-term I think the board, as I am, are positive about our company. And certainly it is accretive, but at the same token, we try to be judicious about it. And perhaps we've been a little conservative but we also had the $3 billion dividend that we divest in December that helped us be a little conservative and I think you'll see that change some.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nOkay, good. And then just my last question and I'll pass it on is just on pricing investments, I know you guys have been doing it religiously for as long as I can remember. I'm wondering with some of the new technologies that you're putting in place, are you studying it a little bit more closely? Do you feel like the elasticity is there to justify the increase in price investments by the U.S.?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWe would never look at it that way. We're out there -- I think, again, getting back to the simple [indiscernible] example. It's not unlike the hot dog example of years gone by. When prices went up, we just saw that as the strength of that and the growth in the number of chickens we're selling that gets people in. We don't study and say what if we took it to $5.49, and we'd have this many fewer shops or whatever. We know it's the right thing to do. And again I think Q4, I mean, Q2 in that first 4-week period, it exacerbates everything because you had all those things, some weaker sales in some bigger-ticket items, some margins on top of the ongoing fresh foods margins. And I'm very emphatic about the fact that our fresh foods margins are us, our pricing, and we'll see some improvement there but we'll do it when we feel good about it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nJust to go back to the comments you made about expenses. If you can just help us provide a little bit more clarity on how we should think about that going forward, maybe an update on where you are on kind of the IT modernization process, anything else of note on health care, payroll and some of the other items.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, on IT, I think now it's been about 6 quarters that I've mentioned it. And it's probably, on average, over the 6 quarters -- I don't have them in front of me, about 4 basis point, and so quarters 5 and 6 in this process, or 4 on top of 4 or 3 on top of 5 or whatever. So -- and that will probably continue for another half-dozen quarters. It's a 5 or so year effort, with at least a 3-year buildup in those types of things. There'll be some quarters, on a year-over-year basis, when it's a couple of basis points. There must be some one that's 4 or 5, depending on when systems are being input. But we have a lot going on. We're excited about -- the user groups are excited about some of the things they're seeing. We're going to start implementing some of the components of it starting in the early summer to late summer. Again, I'm not going to try to be cute or coy here, it will take some time but we've got a lot going on. And again, part of that is the fact that for 25 years, we pride ourselves with having very simple systems. And they're still simple, probably, relative to others, relative to the entire effort. And again so far, so good. But we're 1.5 years into it. And so that's going to still hit us for at least another year, maybe even longer on that line. Beyond that, in terms of SG&A, a lot -- something -- that's just how the numbers work in terms of the fact that you've got FX, a lower weighted average of countries where some of the payroll percent -- as a percent of sales in those respective countries and certainly, the health care as a percent of sales in those countries is a little lower weighted average when you've got -- with the Canada rate down 8% year-over-year to Canada exchange rates. We've got Japan in Q2 down 15% with Japan yen. In Australia, it's down 14.5% year-over-year in the second quarter. So all those things add a little insult to injury. The underlying numbers, they were a little worse in terms of percent -- expense percentages, but big chunks for this were the things that I mentioned.  And again there's lots of little things and they all seem to hit at the same time, on top of the fact that in the quarter where you get a lot of leverage, the 4-week period where you get a lot of leverage was a little weaker than planned.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nUnderstood. And then, if you can just comment on kind of inflation, deflation what you're seeing across various categories, just how we should think about LIFO if you think that will still be a factor in 3Q like we saw here in the second quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, if I look at the -- compared to year-end, just our entire LIFO pool, at mid-year, it's up about 0.25%. So just like cost of all items. There was $100 item that we paid for, $100 for -- at September 1, if you will. At February 16, we were paying, on average, $100.25. As you'd expect, there's some deflationary pools like computers and what have you. You've got probably the most inflation in food and sundries, a little over 1%. You've got a shade of gas inflation, although that's ticking down right now a little bit. So it doesn't seem -- overall, there doesn't seem to be a lot of inflation. But on a $4-plus billion LIFO -- and LIFO is a U.S. concept only. So on a $4-plus billion, I don't know, probably $5 billion LIFO pool, 1% would be $50 million, 0.25% would be $12.5 million. I don't think it should be a lot. And I don't have in front of me last year's LIFO numbers for Q3 and 4. I thought I did. Right there -- not to disclose[ph] anything, but in Q3 and 4 -- only so much you can -- last year, in Q3 and 4, LIFO was a credit, a benefit of about $8 million -- $7.5 million and $8 million in each of Q3 and 4. So if it is a little inflationary, we'll see that same kind of -- a similar kind of swing that we saw in Q2, but we'll wait and see. Mind you when there's a LIFO charge, there's probably -- that's again, I look at a combination of that with a quarter or 2 because they tend to work, not always, but in tandem. One opposing the other. But not a lot of inflation.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Horvers (Analysts)】\nSo 2 questions. First, as you model out FX at the end of the period, when do you think that the FX might stop turning to sort of a flat scenario, the total comp versus the core comps?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nThat is -- I don't know, and I'm not even a student of some of this FedEx -- of this foreign exchange stuff. But when you see, as an example, in Japan first quarter year-over-year was down 20%. Second quarter year-over-year, it was down 15% for us in terms of the Japanese yen. So there's been a lot of weakening. At some point, it's going to bounce back a little bit, but I can't tell you when. Canada has been awfully strong for many years, and it's now subsiding a little bit. But who knows? And then add to that the craziness of the world events that could impact these numbers. Usually, when there's issues going on, world issues going on, the dollar strengthens. And I think that's a little bit of what's happening now but also, particularly in the case of Canada, I remember 20 years ago when the Canadian dollar was CAD 0.65 on the U.S. dollar and it actually gotten above CAD 1 on the U.S. dollar, and it's come down a little bit. So it kind of bounced off of that peak, but I can't tell you when that's going to be.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Horvers (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just as a follow-up. The ancillary business, the margins in that business had been a positive for quite some time, and it looks like if I got the numbers right, it was flat this quarter. What piece of the business is changing? And is there anything you could say about the outlook?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nA lot of it has to do with gas deflation, just the weighted average of that chunk. Mind you, gas -- gasoline sales as a percent of our company total sales is 11% or 12%. And so it's a huge chunk, and we've got gas deflation. That alone -- and gas -- people will say our reporting gross margin is in the whatever, 10.5% plus range, 10% to 11% range. Within that number, gas is in the 1% to 5% range every quarter. So that weighted average coming down has an impact on that number. So you've got to look at it both ways. Overall, ancillary businesses were fine. Our pharmacy business continues strong. Our hearing aid business, although small, is very strong. 1 hour photo, as you would expect, continues to be a little weaker because of -- nobody takes as many pictures. But we did a little creative over there, they tried to do a few other things. But it's still very profitable but not as profitable as it used to be. So if you add it all up, gas deflation was probably the biggest reason.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Miller (Analysts)】\nYou gave us some additional detail this quarter on the 4-week versus the 8-week, and I want to make sure we got the right impression from this. Given you said that the margins, if I heard this right, on hardlines and fresh foods being down 30 to 50, does that mean that at the remaining 8 weeks of the quarter you would have actually had gross margins up overall? And is it a fair impression that without those first 4 weeks, your earnings are closer to the double-digit type growth range?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nIt was -- in the first 4 weeks, one of the things we talked about in the press release was this -- those hardline categories, that was impactful in the first 4 weeks, whereas, fresh foods is more, again, us and -- contributed in the quarter. The 30 to 50 range for those types of categories that were down year-over-year was for the entire quarter. I don't have the detail by period here but directionally I would think, given the 4 -- first 4 weeks was worse, it clearly showed some improvement.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Miller (Analysts)】\nAll right. Has Costco done market research looking at the number of your members that also have an Amazon prime membership? And do your merchants have any sense for how much this might be impacting spending at Costco? Do you think that might have been a bigger factor on the holidays with gift-giving or do you think it's not a material change?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nActually, I think some of you guys out there do more surveying of that than we do. Honestly, I've read some research out there that talks about the overlap. There is overlap. My guess is, clearly, in areas like the books and CDs, that's a changed business over the last many years. TVs, frankly, were not bad overall. And particularly if you had our e-commerce too are in line, were up a shade for the quarter. I can't tell you what happened in the 4 weeks of February because they were, what we call, majors or electronics was down in the mid-single digits year-over-year. But for overall, we probably fared better than most in-line, and all that stuff takes away a little bit. We're looking at ways to get, as we have now for a while, to get younger people here in as well. We recognize that, and we'll continue to do that. So that -- I know the answer is no, there's not a lot of discernible concern at this point in time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nI'll start by just jumping off of from the last question about trying to get younger people into the warehouses. Can you talk a little bit about what it is you have done or would consider doing to make that happen? What tools do you have?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, first and foremost, we're not going to do anything rash, but we're also not going to have our head in the sand here. I mean, one of the things -- the test, as an example, with Google, among several retailers in the Bay Area has been interesting. I'm not going to, again, talk about any detail yet. We've done a few things with some of the social media things out there. One of the impacts, which is what we do, is the rise of organic. It's a big business. It's growing fast. We can actually show a better savings on those bigger-ticket price point items. And we see that time and again, whether it's organic ground beef or those giant packs of kale or you name it -- and milk. I mean, we're doing huge business in that. That I think also is driving in some younger people. Some of the -- one of the first systems going in our modernization effort is a new membership system, which we'll start rolling out in the U.S. I believe June, July. And again, there'll be a lot more bells and whistles but as you know, our systems have been pretty basic and primitive. And we're not going to go crazy overnight on it. But we're doing a few things and if it works, and we'll keep doing some of those things. So that's what I can tell you at this point.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then I just have a sort of bigger-picture question. It's obviously that it's your philosophy to pick -- provide very great value, especially in fresh foods to your customers and you'll absorb some inflation. But what do you do, I mean, everything I see -- meat has been inflationary for a while, especially beef. Do you have to sit down and think about your strategy if it looks like there are items that are just going to be inflationary for the long term?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, part of the answer's no. We do what we do, and part of it though is that we also recognize that we need to -- our goal is just to maximize shareholder value and ultimately, that turns into long-term driving earnings. And -- but we're not going to necessarily do something in the short term or in a given quarter to do that. Again, looking at Q2, it was a combination of -- we -- I think I probably said, 6 or 9 months ago using the simple chicken example, that there seem to be in the few months looking forward 6 to 9 months ago, that poultry pricing costing was going to improve, which would improve our margins because we were not lowering the price, we'd just not raised it prior to that. That's finally starting to happen. So those are the kinds of things that we'll do. Strategically at the end of the day, we've got to show improvement in bottom line. Ultimately, it's not going to come from 10% and 15% comps for the company. We're going to have good comps but at the levels that we have and assuming they're still going to be better than others, it's still going to require some margin over time, and we look at that. But we're not terribly concerned about how it impacts the given quarter. And so we -- organic helps. The fact of the matter is -- I think I mentioned this as an example, and one of things that, again, talks about the younger members' wealth. What we found is, when we tried fresh organic ground beef, I think in the first year, we did $25-plus million in an item or 2. This is at a higher price point and a greater savings and a fair margin for us, a better margin for us relative to the more competitive regular ground beef. The cool thing was that 80% of those sales were existing -- were members that had not bought ground beef with us before. They love Costco, but they are organic. On average, I would say they tend to be a little younger, I don't -- that's my guess. And so those are the kinds of things that I think are going to help us a little too. The fact that increasing penetration of our company is overseas, over time, notwithstanding the weak exchange rates this quarter, we generally tend to have a little higher margin overseas, where you don't have -- wherever you -- even in U.S., when you don't have a direct competitor in the market a mile away or less, you're going to have a little better margin. And so all those things I think should impact us positively and -- but we're not going to change what we do in terms of occasionally identifying those key items that we're just not going to budge on.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then one final question, which is kind of related, but you obviously saw softness in some hardline categories. Your electronics has been bad for a while. Do you think at all that you have to rethink how you, the products that you're offering because of that? Is there something else that you would be more aggressive on? Would you take space away? How are you thinking about that longer term?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, as you know, electronics is what greets you when you walk into a Costco. Certainly, the online is part of that. We do a strong business online. Part of it is just because they're bigger, not only bigger-ticket, but bulkier, physical, bulky items. We have a white glove alternative, with installation as well. And so that business is growing. But getting people in the door at Costco, we sell a heck of a lot of TVs as well that way. But again, you have a few unusual things happening right now. Cameras, I understand cameras are down 30-plus percent in the industry. We're not that different. In fact, we've got a lot -- that was very successful and still a big volume business, but that's been weak year-over-year in a bigger way for the first time. Desktops and laptops, we're starting to get some traction on pads, on tablets of late. But I think that's a business -- it'll be tough when we're -- I don't think we're necessarily rethinking allocation of space. If anything, it's still a strong area for us, but it got hammered a little bit over that Christmas selling season. Again, a lot of it wasn't TV, so some of those were other items.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nTwo follow-up questions. The first, just on the gas deflation that you're now starting to see. Can you remind us, does it -- historically, does it impact your traffic trends as gas in general if it does get very deflationary and come down a lot, does it -- do you have to find other ways to keep -- drive that traffic comp?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nInterestingly, when prices are coming down, we actually historically save the member a little more because we turn it so fast, and so we're buying everyday, if you will. And the guy down the street's buying it every 6 or 8 days or 9 days. And so when it's going up, it's costing us a little more when we're competitive. We are still the lowest-priced, hopefully, but there's a little less savings. There's a little less news about it out there. And so I think overall, on a macro basis, when prices are coming down, even though we're saving the customer a little more, it's less newsworthy. The fact that it's not on the nightly news. And so it's probably a little less positive there. But given how big we are in that business now, it's not as impactful either way.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nGot you. And just a different question. Could you remind us, with your international business how you're thinking about new markets? I think France, you've mentioned before. Any update on timing of when you could open a new country?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, Spain is April or May? May. And France is hopefully about 1.5 years. And beyond that, we haven't disclosed anything. In terms of how, there's generally I mean, the 3 likely areas, in no order, is other parts of Europe, South America and China. And we haven't really stated beyond France and Spain what our plans are beyond that, nor do we plan to discuss that right now.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Tanal (Analysts)】\nThis is Steve Tanal on for Matt Fassler. Just a quick one on gross margins. It sounds like much of the year-on-year decrease was sort of intentional or through price investments, if you will. And we just want to know how to think about that going forward? In the next few quarters, at a minimum, to do you think the trend's likely to sort of stay in this way or how are you guys thinking about that near term?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, first of all, let me correct -- maybe with all the different numbers going around here, in terms of Q2, fresh was intentional. The rest of it was not intentional. Some of it's promotional. Some of it just we do what we do to have clean inventories took some extra seasonal markdowns in some areas, including a little bit of electronics. And some of it -- so some of it was that. So in terms of the trends going forward, again, I've alluded to the fact that we're starting to see a little better costing on the poultry side. Meat continues to be competitive and rising. And then on -- beyond that, I can't tell you a whole lot. But a big chunk -- again, produce -- meat, not produce. Fresh foods was our proactive aggressiveness. The rest of it is doing what we do and responding to competition and responding to -- we see being a little weaker and getting rid of stuff.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Tanal (Analysts)】\nUnderstood. That's very helpful, actually. And just on the membership fees, we seem to underestimate the impact of FX there, but it also does seem like -- as I think about FX and the overall comp, you guys talked about sort of a 2-percentage-point drag. It looks like it was more like 3 on member fees. Is there anything you could sort of help us as we think about the split there, international versus U.S. and how to get that right going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nIt's -- I think the biggest impact FX-wise was in Canada, which is 10%, 12% of our company. And I think a higher -- a strong penetration in Executive Memberships, which is the higher fee. So those things probably pushed it a little bit. In terms of guessing, in the future, your guess is as good as mine.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Tanal (Analysts)】\nUnderstood, understood. And just to confirm this, there were no buybacks in the second quarter, correct? And you guys are intending to buy back in the third quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nCorrect.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Drbul (Analysts)】\nI just got 2 questions for you. The first one is, can you comment a little bit -- Canada was strong for you fundamentally. Can you just talk a little bit about the market, what's going on there with Costco's positioning? And the second question is can you just give us an update on the private label initiative in Kirkland Signature and sort of new products or new categories that you guys are excited about looking forward.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nOh, Canada's strong. I mean Canada, thankfully, is not only that we're the only club in town, which is a positive, it has everything good in it, historically, in the last several years, everything good about it. It has a good economy. It didn't have the financial crisis issues that the U.S. had. It's got a -- of course, a part of its economy is natural resource based, which has been on fire. So those are all positive things. It has lower health care expenses as a percent of sales just by the nature of the health care up there versus here. And so all those things have been positive for us. And again, though, when you've got an 8% decline year-over-year in currency, that washes that away in terms of how we report it for February. In terms of private label, I think some of the areas, apparel has been one that's -- that used, I think, to be exciting. I've talked ad nauseum in the past about in the last year about the wool slack. We've got a great gabardine slack now that's I think $19.99. We -- I know we have some additional women's athletic items. And so we're doing -- that'll be an area, I think, that will continue to grow for us. On the food side, organic. We're doing some -- a few more items. And in a lot of places, it'll continue to grow. And I think what probably over time we haven't appreciated is the strength of it not only in the U.S. or in Canada, both these items being able to take to other countries where, when we take a regular branded international item to that country, we showed incredible savings where prices have always been high. On these items, given the quality level and the pricing, the strength is I think exacerbated even more and that's a positive.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Benedict (Analysts)】\nMost of my questions been asked, but just a quick one on February. Just, you made the decision to call out weather and the impact there. Was the weather materially different than what you saw in January? And I mean, I know you kind of said there were some stuff that happened in Japan. Is that what kind of tipped it because in the U.S., it just feels like kind of January, February were basically pretty similar.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, you probably live in that area. It was more severe in February. As an example, just for the last week of February, the Southwest got hammered with rain for 5 days. Japan was -- to the company, was just another insult to injury, if you will. I mean, I think we have what, 18 units in Japan? I don't have the exact detail in front of me. Let's assume half a dozen or 6 or 8 of them were impacted in the Tokyo market. So again, that was just a little bit more but overall, yes, it was more extensive than we've seen before.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Benedict (Analysts)】\nThat's good color. And then just on the club openings, looks like you're going to kind of get to that 30 kind of gross number this year that you guys were hoping for. What about as we look to next year, I mean, you think you can -- you're still confident you can get that number north of 30?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes. Yes, I mean Craig's goal, Craig and Jeff Brotman's goal is to get into that low 30, 30-plus range. I'm sure now that I've said it, we'll get 28 or 29. But at the end of the day, we're shooting for 30 to 35 a year for the next 5 years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nRichard, I had 2 questions. First, on electronics and then on membership. You've mentioned it was up but then you listed some categories like cameras and such that were all down. Was it just TVs that drove CE, and was that ASP or volume?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nExcuse me, what? Tablets were part of it. Also the quarter overall was different than February. February was a little weaker in electronics. The biggest chunk is TVs just by volume, and so -- and that's partly why February -- TVs were weaker in February relatively speaking than they were for the quarter when they were actually about flat. And I think the average sale price is about flat. It had been up. Bob's saying it's up. I have this -- out here. Hold on. I could tell you. In the second quarter, the average price point looks like it was up a couple of percent, and that's probably because we're selling bigger-ticket, bigger TVs, Smarter TV. And by the way, one of the comments that I heard in the budget meeting last week was that the rollout of the next-generation of technology in TVs has been a little bit delayed, and it's going to be in a few months, April instead of January. I'm being coached here. And so again, that should help it a little bit, but we'll see.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nOkay. Great. Well, I don't think you need any coaching for the next question. On memberships, just want to make sure I'm getting this right. We finally have a quarter that's telling in terms of the fee increase.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nSo if we're up 7...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nIn local currency.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nIs it fair to say that in the U.S. while membership renewals are great, and you have that -- the mix towards Executive, that memberships per club in the U.S. is actually trending down a little bit. And if that's the case, has that shifted at all?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI don't have that detail here. I'd have to look. I -- to the extent that we've opened 14 or so U.S. warehouses, it may be a little bit. But actually, it's -- I don't know if I'm correct on that. I have to look.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nOkay. We can follow-up on it. But conceptually, you still have the mix shift going on to Executive.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes. By the way, one of the things is -- I'll give you an example. We opened in -- just a couple of -- 3 years ago in Huntington Beach, California, in L.A. We have 50-plus percent of the households or more in that maybe greater L.A. market where we've got 40 or so locations. We may open up in a new market there with the 8 to 15 weeks prior to opening, you sign up for tabling activities. As of opening day, we might have 5,000 or less new members. New members. In the meantime, that's a unit that may very well -- will exceed our company average for the first year with -- do 150 million, 100 million of which is new and 50 million which is cannibalized. So you've got members that are closer, that are going to shop more frequently for the first time. Contrast that in Asia where, again, during those 8 to 15 weeks prior to opening, as of opening day, we see numbers in the 25,000 to 50,000 new member sign-ups, with a bigger renewal -- a lower renewal rate but, nonetheless, so that should be a big difference. So my guess is that yes, it could be flat or down slightly, but that would be expected in that example.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nI'll be quick since it's the end of the call. Just wanted to follow up on the inflation question and produce inflation, deflation and whatnot, with the potential of some inflation working into produce, you guys investing in price there. How is that going to work through as we work through the next, say, quarter or 2 if we can get some spikes in produce inflation. How does that work through your numbers?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nMy guess, it would help a little unlike -- meat is so much more -- as in general, meat is consumed more out there. Produce, everybody's got different items, different pack sizes, different qualities. And we could still show great savings, but it's just not, in my view, it's just not the same type of level of competition. So I don't think that's going to impact us as more -- that, that will impact us as much. The big thing in produce is when there's a drought or a freeze and when -- we're doing hundreds of millions of dollars of items, be it strawberries or blueberries and when, in a given month, you did $5 million in an item instead of $15 million during a holiday item or if that plateaus because of the freeze, that's more impactful than composition.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nAnd then just one last one that's more, a little  bit more strategic. And if you don't want to take it, you can always talk off-line. But as you guys expand internationally that becomes much more focus than the growth. And we've seen other retailers try this and it has worked well. It's working well for you guys. But just talk about the structure a little bit you're putting in place to make sure that you kind of keep momentum up overseas.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, first and foremost, we start in any country with existing employees that are from our company. The woman running Spain is a seasoned Operations person, Executive from Canada for many, many years. The guy running Taiwan goes back to the Price Club days in Southern California. And the guy running Korea started as a Warehouse Manager at Costco. And before that, I believe [indiscernible]. So -- but when we go over there to -- when we go over, we send a core group of half a dozen people, 3 or 4 people to merchandising operations. I think the biggest thing to make sure everybody's on the same page is these individuals travel to Seattle every 4 weeks. So 13 times a year for 1.5 days budget meeting and they're typically there for an extra day doing some other operations or merchandising specific meetings. And then like Jim, for many years, Craig and others are traveling to those countries often. Craig's out of the country today. And so the biggest way we do it I think is everybody being on the same page. The other thing is, I'll give you a good example, when asked before why have we've been so successful in several countries, including some of these countries in Asia. We think part of it is, is not only is our value proposition more extreme over there, and also that people actually do like big American stuff. The fact is, is that some of these private label items that we're developing now have been huge successes in some of these other countries. And those U.S.-sourced goods, and so I think all those things play well into our hand. But that's going to change over time. And so we do what we do best is we're constantly focused on it. I mean, when these heads of countries and different countries come to Seattle every 4 weeks, one of the things that each of the senior VPs of Operations around -- and every country has 1, Canada has 2 and the U.S. has 8. But all those foreign ones, they come here and one of the things that they report on is what initiatives in terms of global sourcing, procuring goods from a multinational manufacturer where the U.S. buys a heck of a lot from. Perhaps, Canada does because we're big and have been around a long time. But because of whatever it is, the licensing arrangement or regional pressure on their side, it's a work in progress that we're making good success there. All those things, they're little things, but they help us every day. So I think that'll continue. It's really a lot of that blocking and tackling, and we have -- just like we did when we went to Alaska for the first time and to Hawaii for the first time, we feel that we've really lowered prices in those markets and made it more competitive, but we still shine better competitively versus other retail formats. Given the fact that in some of these countries pricing has been a lot higher, and I think that has helped us. And in bringing goods, whether it's the jumbo cashews or the fresh blueberries to countries where they're buying a lot more of it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sandra Barker (Analysts)】\nI just wanted to clarify, maybe you said this and I missed it, but when you talked about the 30 to 50 basis points of gross margin impact, how much of that would have been sort of the responsive price cuts versus proactive?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, I guess there's 3 things you're talking about, I can't tell you exactly. I know in fresh foods it's us just wanting to keep the price where it is on key items and doing what we do. If you think about, let's take hardlines or let's take whether it's electronics or clothes or whatever, if sales are a little soft, we're proactive to mark things down to get rid of them before the season ends. Structurally, we have the benefit I think of being in and out of seasons early, but that doesn't mean we still don't have to take some excess markdowns sometimes. In terms of responsive, I would say proactive is more impactful than responsive, the issue of being responsive. But there's some responsive, too, out there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sandra Barker (Analysts)】\nAnd is that -- do you see any changes in the competitive landscape, and where is it coming from?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nNo. We really haven't. I mean, there's still a lot of tough competition out there. Yes, we wish that -- part of the challenge with the Internet and delivery. Is delivery included, and what extra things? I think we've -- we're getting a little better at communicating what's the value in our product in terms of an extra Controller or whatever it is or the shipping and because when we do price shop, the least competitive ones are some of those that are on the Internet. And I don't mean to name names.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Feldman (Analysts)】\nJust wanted to ask you competitively, I've seen a lot from your other big major club competitor out there lately in terms of testing some stuff with online membership or being a little more aggressive in different countries. And I'm just wondering if you guys are seeing any impact of that or any pressure or just how you're dealing with kind of the competitive issues.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, in terms of direct club competition, no. I mean, they did-- I believe Sam's did a fee increase that they tested originally in Texas, and they've rolled that out now in the U.S. They're only, by the way, in the U.S. and Mexico. But we have not seen any -- Sam's is very competitive but we haven't seen any giant changes in that or us needing to respond to something that they have done.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, thank you, everyone, and look forward to chatting in 12 weeks. Have a good day.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Foot Locker Inc.'s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. We are pleased to have announced this morning record financial performance for both the quarter and the year. \r\nIn the fourth quarter, we earned net income of $121 million or $0.81 per share, an increase of 19%, bringing our full year earnings to $429 million or $2.85 per share. These full year earnings compared to the $2.58 per share generated in 2012. \r\nOn a non-GAAP basis, we earned $0.82 per share in the fourth quarter, a 28% increase over last year's 13-week non-GAAP earnings of $0.64 per share. For the full year, on a non-GAAP basis, we achieved a 16% increase in earnings per share to $2.87 from $2.47 a year ago. \r\nAs we described changes in quarterly or annual ratios and margins during this call, we will be referring to non-GAAP results that also exclude the extra week in 2012 since, in our view, this approach provides the most useful basis of comparison. \r\nIn this morning's press release, we have included a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. And in the 8-K filed this morning, there is a detailed calculation of our non-GAAP performance measurements. \r\nHere with me this morning to provide the details are Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dick Johnson, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Ken Hicks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We have a lot of ground to cover this morning, so I'll hand it right over to you, Lauren.\n\n---\n\nWe sure do, John. Thank you, and let me thank all of you who have joined us this morning to cover the details of Foot Locker's 2013 results and to hear about our current view of 2014. \r\nNoted in our press release this morning, the fourth quarter of 2013 was another strong performance by our company, our best fourth quarter as an athletic company. We achieved a solid 5.3% comparable sales gain and a 9.7% total sales gain, lifted by our comps and $70 million of sales by Runners Point Group. \r\nThe fourth quarter sales results brought our full year total sales to $6.5 billion, another record for us, and a 6.6% increase over last year's 52-week result of $6.1 billion. Most of the broad trends we saw throughout the year continued in Q4. For example, our strongest segment was our Direct-to-Customer business, which generated a 13% comparable sales increase. Within that segment, Eastbay was up low-single digits. CCS was down high teens, and our store banner.com sites were up again at more than 40%. \r\nIn fact, our store banner.com sales were up more than 40% for the year overall, the second consecutive year at that level and the third consecutive year with at least a 30% increase. Within the store segment, we produced sales gains in every region in which we operate. \r\nIn the U.S., our improvements were led again by our children's business, with Kids Foot Locker itself up low-double digits in the quarter. Foot Locker in the U.S. also posted a strong result, up high-single digits. Footaction was up low singles, while Champs Sports and Lady Foot Locker were down slightly.\r\nInternationally, our Foot Locker Asia Pacific business had a terrific quarter, generating a low-double digit sales gain, while our businesses in Europe and Canada were up mid-single digits.\r\nComparable sales were positive throughout the quarter, with November up low-single digits. December, the month you really want to hit the ball as far as you can, was up high singles, and January was up in mid-single digits. \r\nBy category of business, footwear was the driver of our success in the quarter with a gain in the mid-singles. Average selling prices and unit sales were both up. Basketball was definitely the strongest component of footwear, with many divisions posting double-digit gains. \r\nIn the U.S., running was down a bit. It's not too much of a surprise, given the challenging winter weather much of the country experienced in the quarter. Internationally, where the weather was relatively mild, we had solid gains in both running and basketball.\r\nApparel and Accessories sales were down mid-single digits. Average selling prices were up a tick, but unit volume was down. We continue to transition our assortment towards a more premium offering. Dick will talk more about apparel in a few minutes. \r\nTurning now to the rest of the income statement. Our gross margin rate ticked up 10 basis points in the quarter to 32.5%. For the full year, our gross margin rate was flat at its record high level of 32.8%. The familiar pattern of fixed cost leverage, offset partially by a lower initial market rate, was evident in the fourth quarter.\r\nUnlike most of the year, however, in Q4, we did increase markdown slightly higher than last year in order to ensure that our inventory position remains fresh heading into 2014. We believe that strategy worked well as inventory at year end was up just 4.5% over last year, compared to the 9.7% sales increase I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks. Using constant currencies and excluding Runners Point, our inventory was up just 1.3%. It was actually down slightly on a per growth square foot basis.\r\nFootwear margins improved about 20 basis points, while apparel margins fell in the quarter. The story was much the same for the full year. So in total, apparel penetration fell back slightly to 23.1% in 2013. And apparel margins still have yet to catch and surpass footwear margins. We continue to believe doing so is possible, but it will clearly take time and a lot of hard work. While we believe our margin and inventory performance was strong, it was our expense management that, as CFO, I was particularly proud off. \r\nOur SG&A rate improved 110 basis points to 20.3% in the quarter. And for the full year, we came in at a record low 20.4%, down 60 basis points from 2012's rate. Top line growth, coupled with diligent expense management, is a powerful combination. I'd like to thank our many team members responsible for that accomplishment for a job well done. \r\nIn Q4, our store wages, the biggest component of SG&A, declined almost 20 basis points as a percent of sales, due to both a very strong performance by our store operations teams and to various technology tools we have implemented over the last year or so in order to improve our hiring and labor scheduling processes. We also reduced our marketing expenses compared to a year ago, although we were still able to develop some very memorable marketing campaigns, such as the All Is Right campaign during the Week of Greatness, which produced more than 1 billion, billion with the B, impressions over the course of the quarter. It was quite remarkable. \r\nOur depreciation and amortization came in at $36 million for the quarter, 2% of sales and in line with our expectations. Our tax rate came in below last year, due primarily to the ongoing effect of certain recently implemented tax planning initiatives, which received a particular boost in the fourth quarter due to a favorable development in our foreign tax position. In fact, these initiatives should enable us to achieve a somewhat lower tax rate going forward, which I'll describe a bit later when I provide our outlook for 2014.\r\nThe bottom line was a very healthy non-GAAP net income result in the quarter of $122 million, an impressive increase of 26% over Q4 2012. And non-GAAP net income of $432 million for the full year, a solid 14% increase over last year's record performance.\r\nOn an earnings per share basis, we improved 28% in the quarter, $0.64 to $0.82, with the additional increase coming from the reduction in our outstanding shares. As noted in our press release, we repurchased almost 1.6 million shares of our common stock in the fourth quarter at a cost of $63 million. It's brought our full year repurchase program to 6.4 million shares at a cost of $229 million, up appreciably from the $129 million we spent in 2012. \r\nIn addition to the significant return of cash to shareholders, we also paid $118 million in dividends during 2013. Last month, we announced that our board had authorized a 10% increase to our current quarterly dividend rate to $0.22. This is the fourth consecutive year with a meaningful dividend increase. \r\nOverall, in 2013, we returned $348 million of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. This amount represents more than 80% of our net income for the year. We also finished 2013 having spent $206 million in capital to invest in a variety of store, digital, technology and infrastructure projects.\r\nI'll let Dick cover the details of that program in a moment. But suffice it to say, that even with funding all these initiatives, plus the acquisition of Runners Point, we ended the year of strong financial position with $728 million of cash, net of balance sheet debt.\r\nWe ended the year with 3,473 stores, an increase of 138 from the beginning of the year. Excluding Runners Point Group, our store base decreased by 55 stores, with the biggest decreases coming at Lady Foot Locker, Foot Locker in the U.S. and CCS, where we closed all 22 of our CCS retail stores. The primary increases were in Kids Foot Locker and in Foot Locker Europe.\r\nLet me now turn the call over to Dick to add more color to these strong results. Before we get to your questions, I'll jump back in to discuss our annual and quarterly expectations for 2014. Dick?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Lauren. I want to start by expressing my gratitude to everyone on the team at Foot Locker for doing so much to make this past year such a success. There's so many important contributions all around the globe, but there's just not enough time to do justice to any of them -- to all of them. But rest assured, your efforts are truly appreciated. \r\nFor the fourth quarter, I'll touch on some of the key product themes that drove the business. I started off last quarter highlighting the strength of the Jordan brand. And sure enough, that brand continued its very strong performance in all of our markets around the globe. \r\nJordan Retro, Classic and Performance Shoes all sold well, as did Jordan tees, fleece, shorts and socks. Lauren mentioned the basketball was the strongest category in Q4, and so in addition to Jordan, we drove very solid sales results in signature product. Innovative styles of Lebron, Kobe and KD footwear performed very well, along with Foamposites and certain other marquee player shoes.\r\nRunning was down slightly in the U.S. But within the category, we saw continued strength in performance running. For example, the relatively new SpringBlade program from Adidas sold well, as did the well-established Nike Free. Among the lifestyle running silhouettes, the Roche Run from Nike has shown a lot of life, both in the U.S. and in Europe. Lauren mentioned that running was up in Europe, and in addition to the Roche, several Air Max styles sold well. \r\nBoots were a popular footwear choice in the quarter, especially Timberland and Nike. This was primarily a style choice because Timberland boots, along with accessories such as knit caps, sold in warm weather markets in the U.S. just as well as they did where it snowed. \r\nApparel sales were down a bit in the quarter. Jordan apparel was certainly an exception as the hookup graphic in logo tees and fleece, in particular, sold very well. The apparel that hooked to the marquee player shoes also sold through good rates. It was primarily the more lifestyle-driven apparel that posted declines. There was a lot of pretty intense promotional competition in the mall for that customer during the quarter. \r\nWhile there is definitely a place for some of the less athletic apparel in our banners, overall, we will continue to focus on a more premium performance-based brand of assortment, which we believe is what our customers expect us to deliver. \r\nOn the Accessories front, our performance sock business continues to expand, as does the backpack business, which also tilts towards the premium end of the price spectrum, with fashion hooks to the key shoes and apparel in our stores.\r\nTurning to our 2014 capital program. We are targeting at a total of approximately $220 million. We continue to generate strong sales lifts from most of the remodeled formats we began rolling out in 2013. We have many different types of projects with very different amounts of capital spent per project. So the lift required to justify the expenditure is also very different. This is one of the reasons we have not given a single number in terms of the sales lift from the remodels, but we watch carefully the financial performance of each and every project relative to our hurdle rates and make adjustments to future projects accordingly.\r\nIn 2014, we expect to continue the remodel programs in Foot Locker and Champs Sports and expect to have touched at least 20% of the domestic Foot Locker and 30% of the Champs stores by the end of the year. The basic reformatting of the Kids Foot Locker is already complete, but we do have a Nike Fly Zone shop in KFL that we are testing more of in 2014. We opened 2 new Footaction prototype stores in 2013, and based on their initial success, we plan to expand that test in 2014.\r\nWe are also very excited about the potential for new Jordan Flight 23 shops in Footaction. We have one prototype store now, and we believe that this type of shop-in-shop could provide a real lift to many of the stores in that fleet. \r\nWe have allocated capital to both SIX:02 and Lady Foot Locker in 2014. First, for SIX:02, we're continuing to build the brand and refine our model during the current test phase. The stores are doing well, but we need to continue reading the results, making layout and assortment adjustments, at least through the spring selling season, before finalizing our rollout strategy. \r\nWe will keep learning in order to maximize the potential in the SIX:02 banner. For Lady Foot Locker, 2013 was a year of assortment transition, shifting out of lifestyle businesses and into fitness and performance. We are rolling out our Bridgewater format in many of our existing Lady Foot Locker stores this year based on successful tests. Our Bridgewater format is essentially a smaller scale version of the parks format. You may recall that we have 19 parks format stores where we have adjusted the look of the store and the assortment to be performance oriented, like SIX:02, but still with the Lady Foot Locker name above the door. Bridgewater is the new format, which we are using, which can be applied to a variety of store layouts, including some of the smaller Lady Foot Locker stores that can't accommodate the full performance apparel assortment of the larger stores.\r\nIn Champs Sports and Foot Locker, we have 2 different billion-dollar men's businesses in the U.S. And ultimately, we see no reason why we can't have $1 billion women's business also. \r\nFinally, let me we touch on our European business. Overall, Europe produced a mid-single-digit comparable sales gain and improved profit contribution. As you might expect, some of these countries were stronger than others, and one of the strongest countries was Germany, where we also added significantly to our business in 2013 by acquiring the Runners Point Group. \r\nRunners Point Group generated a small profit in Q4 and was slightly accretive for the period in 2013 when we owned the business. We are satisfied with that initial result, and we look forward to realizing the benefits from a number of merchandising, market segmentation and operational improvements that we had started to make there. \r\nWith our heritage in running, Runners Point's biggest selling season is in the spring, and we haven't owned the business during that period yet. We fully expect Runners Point Group to be profitable in 2014 and the accretion should grow over time as we develop the business and implement strategies to improve their financial and operation performance. \r\nI'll hand the ball off to Ken now to add his perspective on the business.\n\n---\n\nThank you very much, Dick. Let me echo your thanks to the entire Foot Locker team that delivered these exceptionally strong results. During the last few years, the team has built strong momentum in our overall performance. As a result of diligently executing the many initiatives that support our strategic priorities, we have delivered a growing number of strengths and opportunities upon which we can continue to build as we strive to reach our long-range goals. \r\nWe have substantially diversified many aspects of our business in recent years. First, we have a very strong men's business. And now our children's business is quite robust, too. We also have a very solid strategy for the women's business to bring it up to the productivity level of the rest of the company. \r\nWe recognize that we could not accomplish that goal with the layout and size of the stores and the merchandise assortments in most of our existing Lady Foot Locker fleet. So we are undergoing the major transformation of the women's business that Dick described.\r\nSecond, our position in basketball is very strong. And we have also strengthened our running and casual footwear offerings, as well as our apparel assortments. This has given us a better merchandise balance than before. \r\nThird, we have clearly differentiated our banners, enabling each of them to focus on a particular customer set, whether it's on the performance end of the spectrum, such as Foot Locker, Eastbay, Runners Point and SIX:02, or the lifestyle end, such as Footaction, Sidestep and CCS. Meanwhile, Champs Sports is able to effectively serve customers across a broad athletic spectrum. \r\nFourth, we're no longer just a U.S.-focused company with a modest international presence. We are now a large global company. Including our franchise partners, we operate well over 1,000 stores in 29 countries outside the U.S., and along with our international and local country digital sites, we're approaching $2 billion in international sales.\r\nAnd finally, we're not just a bricks-and-mortar business. We have a strong, fast-growing collection of digital sites, both in the U.S. and abroad, and we've grown our digital sales to be more than 10% of our total sales.\r\nAll of these strengths have provided us with an exciting number of opportunities to drive our business forward in the coming years. Fortunately, some of these opportunities are having an impact now, and we expect that they will continue to do so over the relatively near term, which I define as the next -- into the next year. These include, first, our children's business, across not just Kids Foot Locker where sales increased at a mid-teen pace in 2013, but across all of our banners, channels and geographies.\r\nSecond, growth in Europe, where we have seen recovery in most of our markets and where Germany, given the Runners Point acquisition, is now our largest market. In the near term, we'll focus on customer segmentation inside Germany and expansion of the Foot Locker banner in markets where we believe we are under-penetrated.\r\nThird, improvements in our running and apparel business. Both of these categories are strong, but growth slowed in 2013. Looking ahead, we have a promising pipeline of premium running products from many vendors, including Nike, Adidas, ASICS, Under Armour, Mizuno, New Balance and Puma. \r\nFourth, continued expansion of specialized presentations in our stores, in partnership with our vendors. With Nike, these include the House of Hoops, Yardline, Kids Fly Zone and Jordan Flight 23 shops. With Adidas, we have the Adi Collective and original shops. And we recently opened our first 2 Puma Performance Labs. \r\nFifth, we will continue to enhance the connectivity between our store banners and our banner e-commerce sites. We're stepping up our investments make the sites more engaging, entertaining and shopper friendly.\r\nFinally, we use technology to improve our customer service, inventory effectiveness and productivity of our sales associates. \r\nIn the intermediate term of, say, 2 to 3 years, we have additional opportunities to build on our momentum. Examples include: the cumulative sales lift of our store remodel programs as we start to hit critical mass; the potential expansion of the Runners Point and Sidestep banners outside their current markets; investing in technology, the most prominent example of which is the new merchandise allocation system we intend to roll out later this year; and the development of a more meaningful team sales and services business. And Dick spoke about what is perhaps our biggest single, long-term opportunity, the women's business. Between the promising SIX:02 banner and the merchandise assortment changes we're making to Lady Foot Locker, we believe we can create a large, profitable women's business.\r\nThat's a lot of opportunities to seize upon and not all of them will develop exactly how and when we have envisioned. But the breadth of promising growth and profit opportunities I've just listed make for a very exciting future for Foot Locker, not just this year, but, I believe, for many years to come.\r\nNow before we get to your questions, let me hand the call back to Lauren to talk more about the specifics of how we're planning 2014 and all the news that you've been waiting to hear. Lauren?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Ken. As you mentioned in the press release this morning, we are planning for a mid-single-digit comparable sales gain and a double-digit percentage EPS increase during 2014. Many of the themes from 2013 we expect to carry over into 2014, with one notable exception, which is, thankfully, we don't have to worry about significant quarterly sales shift caused by that extra week in 2012. So in fact, we are planning for mid-single-digit comp sales gains in each quarter. Until July, remember, we will have incremental sales from Runners Point Group, at which point their sales and expenses will be in both periods. RPG sales will be in our consolidated comp numbers starting in October. \r\nOn the gross margin front, we expect to experience some ongoing initial market pressure, but we believe we can continue to improve our markdown rates to hold merchandise margin relatively steady in 2014. And we should pick up leverage of our fixed costs to generate an overall gross margin gain of about 30 to 50 basis points. We should also lever the fixed elements of SG&A to produce a 20 to 30 basis point improvement in our SG&A expense rate, where we are currently planning for depreciation and amortization expense to increase to a range of $145 million to $150 million this year.\r\nOur interest expense, we see being flat with last year at around $5 million. Meanwhile, as I alluded to before, our tax team has done a terrific job implementing various tax planning initiatives. And going forward into 2014, we are now are expecting a 36.5% effective tax rate, down from our prior expectation of 37%. We're planning for a $220 million capital expenditure program in 2014. \r\nWe're anticipating about 60 new stores and will likely close about 100. We'll spend about the same amount this year on store remodels. At about 300, the number of projects in 2014 will be close to the number that the team executed last year. The balance of the capital program will be spent on our technology initiatives, our digital sites, our logistics and other facilities and our regular store maintenance requirements.\r\nWe have $371 million left on our share repurchase program, which, as you have seen, we were active in executing during the period of 2013. We expect the share count to continue decreasing as we execute this program. We intend to be disciplined with our inventory growth in 2014 with a goal of ensuring that inventory increases at no more than half the rate of sales growth. That inventory discipline has served us and the entire industry well in recent years. It also set us up for a solid start to 2014, and in fact, our comparable sales are up low-double digits so far in the first quarter through yesterday.\r\nThat said, there's still a long, long way to go in the quarter and the year, so we're going to stay focused on executing our initiatives. In a meeting earlier this week, Ken said something about it being a good to score a touchdown on the first possession of the game. It's certainly better than snapping the ball into the end zone for safety. But it doesn't mean you're going to win the game if the team doesn't keep playing its best. So with that bit of good news, let's get to your questions now. \r\nJohn, just to inform you that we have so many people in the queue to ask questions, that we may not be able to get to everyone on this call.

We have a lot of ground to cover this morning, so I'll hand it right over to you, Lauren.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nWe sure do, John. Thank you, and let me thank all of you who have joined us this morning to cover the details of Foot Locker's 2013 results and to hear about our current view of 2014. \r\nNoted in our press release this morning, the fourth quarter of 2013 was another strong performance by our company, our best fourth quarter as an athletic company. We achieved a solid 5.3% comparable sales gain and a 9.7% total sales gain, lifted by our comps and $70 million of sales by Runners Point Group. \r\nThe fourth quarter sales results brought our full year total sales to $6.5 billion, another record for us, and a 6.6% increase over last year's 52-week result of $6.1 billion. Most of the broad trends we saw throughout the year continued in Q4. For example, our strongest segment was our Direct-to-Customer business, which generated a 13% comparable sales increase. Within that segment, Eastbay was up low-single digits. CCS was down high teens, and our store banner.com sites were up again at more than 40%. \r\nIn fact, our store banner.com sales were up more than 40% for the year overall, the second consecutive year at that level and the third consecutive year with at least a 30% increase. Within the store segment, we produced sales gains in every region in which we operate. \r\nIn the U.S., our improvements were led again by our children's business, with Kids Foot Locker itself up low-double digits in the quarter. Foot Locker in the U.S. also posted a strong result, up high-single digits. Footaction was up low singles, while Champs Sports and Lady Foot Locker were down slightly.\r\nInternationally, our Foot Locker Asia Pacific business had a terrific quarter, generating a low-double digit sales gain, while our businesses in Europe and Canada were up mid-single digits.\r\nComparable sales were positive throughout the quarter, with November up low-single digits. December, the month you really want to hit the ball as far as you can, was up high singles, and January was up in mid-single digits. \r\nBy category of business, footwear was the driver of our success in the quarter with a gain in the mid-singles. Average selling prices and unit sales were both up. Basketball was definitely the strongest component of footwear, with many divisions posting double-digit gains. \r\nIn the U.S., running was down a bit. It's not too much of a surprise, given the challenging winter weather much of the country experienced in the quarter. Internationally, where the weather was relatively mild, we had solid gains in both running and basketball.\r\nApparel and Accessories sales were down mid-single digits. Average selling prices were up a tick, but unit volume was down. We continue to transition our assortment towards a more premium offering. Dick will talk more about apparel in a few minutes. \r\nTurning now to the rest of the income statement. Our gross margin rate ticked up 10 basis points in the quarter to 32.5%. For the full year, our gross margin rate was flat at its record high level of 32.8%. The familiar pattern of fixed cost leverage, offset partially by a lower initial market rate, was evident in the fourth quarter.\r\nUnlike most of the year, however, in Q4, we did increase markdown slightly higher than last year in order to ensure that our inventory position remains fresh heading into 2014. We believe that strategy worked well as inventory at year end was up just 4.5% over last year, compared to the 9.7% sales increase I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks. Using constant currencies and excluding Runners Point, our inventory was up just 1.3%. It was actually down slightly on a per growth square foot basis.\r\nFootwear margins improved about 20 basis points, while apparel margins fell in the quarter. The story was much the same for the full year. So in total, apparel penetration fell back slightly to 23.1% in 2013. And apparel margins still have yet to catch and surpass footwear margins. We continue to believe doing so is possible, but it will clearly take time and a lot of hard work. While we believe our margin and inventory performance was strong, it was our expense management that, as CFO, I was particularly proud off. \r\nOur SG&A rate improved 110 basis points to 20.3% in the quarter. And for the full year, we came in at a record low 20.4%, down 60 basis points from 2012's rate. Top line growth, coupled with diligent expense management, is a powerful combination. I'd like to thank our many team members responsible for that accomplishment for a job well done. \r\nIn Q4, our store wages, the biggest component of SG&A, declined almost 20 basis points as a percent of sales, due to both a very strong performance by our store operations teams and to various technology tools we have implemented over the last year or so in order to improve our hiring and labor scheduling processes. We also reduced our marketing expenses compared to a year ago, although we were still able to develop some very memorable marketing campaigns, such as the All Is Right campaign during the Week of Greatness, which produced more than 1 billion, billion with the B, impressions over the course of the quarter. It was quite remarkable. \r\nOur depreciation and amortization came in at $36 million for the quarter, 2% of sales and in line with our expectations. Our tax rate came in below last year, due primarily to the ongoing effect of certain recently implemented tax planning initiatives, which received a particular boost in the fourth quarter due to a favorable development in our foreign tax position. In fact, these initiatives should enable us to achieve a somewhat lower tax rate going forward, which I'll describe a bit later when I provide our outlook for 2014.\r\nThe bottom line was a very healthy non-GAAP net income result in the quarter of $122 million, an impressive increase of 26% over Q4 2012. And non-GAAP net income of $432 million for the full year, a solid 14% increase over last year's record performance.\r\nOn an earnings per share basis, we improved 28% in the quarter, $0.64 to $0.82, with the additional increase coming from the reduction in our outstanding shares. As noted in our press release, we repurchased almost 1.6 million shares of our common stock in the fourth quarter at a cost of $63 million. It's brought our full year repurchase program to 6.4 million shares at a cost of $229 million, up appreciably from the $129 million we spent in 2012. \r\nIn addition to the significant return of cash to shareholders, we also paid $118 million in dividends during 2013. Last month, we announced that our board had authorized a 10% increase to our current quarterly dividend rate to $0.22. This is the fourth consecutive year with a meaningful dividend increase. \r\nOverall, in 2013, we returned $348 million of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. This amount represents more than 80% of our net income for the year. We also finished 2013 having spent $206 million in capital to invest in a variety of store, digital, technology and infrastructure projects.\r\nI'll let Dick cover the details of that program in a moment. But suffice it to say, that even with funding all these initiatives, plus the acquisition of Runners Point, we ended the year of strong financial position with $728 million of cash, net of balance sheet debt.\r\nWe ended the year with 3,473 stores, an increase of 138 from the beginning of the year. Excluding Runners Point Group, our store base decreased by 55 stores, with the biggest decreases coming at Lady Foot Locker, Foot Locker in the U.S. and CCS, where we closed all 22 of our CCS retail stores. The primary increases were in Kids Foot Locker and in Foot Locker Europe.\r\nLet me now turn the call over to Dick to add more color to these strong results. Before we get to your questions, I'll jump back in to discuss our annual and quarterly expectations for 2014. Dick?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nThanks, Lauren. I want to start by expressing my gratitude to everyone on the team at Foot Locker for doing so much to make this past year such a success. There's so many important contributions all around the globe, but there's just not enough time to do justice to any of them -- to all of them. But rest assured, your efforts are truly appreciated. \r\nFor the fourth quarter, I'll touch on some of the key product themes that drove the business. I started off last quarter highlighting the strength of the Jordan brand. And sure enough, that brand continued its very strong performance in all of our markets around the globe. \r\nJordan Retro, Classic and Performance Shoes all sold well, as did Jordan tees, fleece, shorts and socks. Lauren mentioned the basketball was the strongest category in Q4, and so in addition to Jordan, we drove very solid sales results in signature product. Innovative styles of Lebron, Kobe and KD footwear performed very well, along with Foamposites and certain other marquee player shoes.\r\nRunning was down slightly in the U.S. But within the category, we saw continued strength in performance running. For example, the relatively new SpringBlade program from Adidas sold well, as did the well-established Nike Free. Among the lifestyle running silhouettes, the Roche Run from Nike has shown a lot of life, both in the U.S. and in Europe. Lauren mentioned that running was up in Europe, and in addition to the Roche, several Air Max styles sold well. \r\nBoots were a popular footwear choice in the quarter, especially Timberland and Nike. This was primarily a style choice because Timberland boots, along with accessories such as knit caps, sold in warm weather markets in the U.S. just as well as they did where it snowed. \r\nApparel sales were down a bit in the quarter. Jordan apparel was certainly an exception as the hookup graphic in logo tees and fleece, in particular, sold very well. The apparel that hooked to the marquee player shoes also sold through good rates. It was primarily the more lifestyle-driven apparel that posted declines. There was a lot of pretty intense promotional competition in the mall for that customer during the quarter. \r\nWhile there is definitely a place for some of the less athletic apparel in our banners, overall, we will continue to focus on a more premium performance-based brand of assortment, which we believe is what our customers expect us to deliver. \r\nOn the Accessories front, our performance sock business continues to expand, as does the backpack business, which also tilts towards the premium end of the price spectrum, with fashion hooks to the key shoes and apparel in our stores.\r\nTurning to our 2014 capital program. We are targeting at a total of approximately $220 million. We continue to generate strong sales lifts from most of the remodeled formats we began rolling out in 2013. We have many different types of projects with very different amounts of capital spent per project. So the lift required to justify the expenditure is also very different. This is one of the reasons we have not given a single number in terms of the sales lift from the remodels, but we watch carefully the financial performance of each and every project relative to our hurdle rates and make adjustments to future projects accordingly.\r\nIn 2014, we expect to continue the remodel programs in Foot Locker and Champs Sports and expect to have touched at least 20% of the domestic Foot Locker and 30% of the Champs stores by the end of the year. The basic reformatting of the Kids Foot Locker is already complete, but we do have a Nike Fly Zone shop in KFL that we are testing more of in 2014. We opened 2 new Footaction prototype stores in 2013, and based on their initial success, we plan to expand that test in 2014.\r\nWe are also very excited about the potential for new Jordan Flight 23 shops in Footaction. We have one prototype store now, and we believe that this type of shop-in-shop could provide a real lift to many of the stores in that fleet. \r\nWe have allocated capital to both SIX:02 and Lady Foot Locker in 2014. First, for SIX:02, we're continuing to build the brand and refine our model during the current test phase. The stores are doing well, but we need to continue reading the results, making layout and assortment adjustments, at least through the spring selling season, before finalizing our rollout strategy. \r\nWe will keep learning in order to maximize the potential in the SIX:02 banner. For Lady Foot Locker, 2013 was a year of assortment transition, shifting out of lifestyle businesses and into fitness and performance. We are rolling out our Bridgewater format in many of our existing Lady Foot Locker stores this year based on successful tests. Our Bridgewater format is essentially a smaller scale version of the parks format. You may recall that we have 19 parks format stores where we have adjusted the look of the store and the assortment to be performance oriented, like SIX:02, but still with the Lady Foot Locker name above the door. Bridgewater is the new format, which we are using, which can be applied to a variety of store layouts, including some of the smaller Lady Foot Locker stores that can't accommodate the full performance apparel assortment of the larger stores.\r\nIn Champs Sports and Foot Locker, we have 2 different billion-dollar men's businesses in the U.S. And ultimately, we see no reason why we can't have $1 billion women's business also. \r\nFinally, let me we touch on our European business. Overall, Europe produced a mid-single-digit comparable sales gain and improved profit contribution. As you might expect, some of these countries were stronger than others, and one of the strongest countries was Germany, where we also added significantly to our business in 2013 by acquiring the Runners Point Group. \r\nRunners Point Group generated a small profit in Q4 and was slightly accretive for the period in 2013 when we owned the business. We are satisfied with that initial result, and we look forward to realizing the benefits from a number of merchandising, market segmentation and operational improvements that we had started to make there. \r\nWith our heritage in running, Runners Point's biggest selling season is in the spring, and we haven't owned the business during that period yet. We fully expect Runners Point Group to be profitable in 2014 and the accretion should grow over time as we develop the business and implement strategies to improve their financial and operation performance. \r\nI'll hand the ball off to Ken now to add his perspective on the business.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Kenneth Hicks (Executives)】\nThank you very much, Dick. Let me echo your thanks to the entire Foot Locker team that delivered these exceptionally strong results. During the last few years, the team has built strong momentum in our overall performance. As a result of diligently executing the many initiatives that support our strategic priorities, we have delivered a growing number of strengths and opportunities upon which we can continue to build as we strive to reach our long-range goals. \r\nWe have substantially diversified many aspects of our business in recent years. First, we have a very strong men's business. And now our children's business is quite robust, too. We also have a very solid strategy for the women's business to bring it up to the productivity level of the rest of the company. \r\nWe recognize that we could not accomplish that goal with the layout and size of the stores and the merchandise assortments in most of our existing Lady Foot Locker fleet. So we are undergoing the major transformation of the women's business that Dick described.\r\nSecond, our position in basketball is very strong. And we have also strengthened our running and casual footwear offerings, as well as our apparel assortments. This has given us a better merchandise balance than before. \r\nThird, we have clearly differentiated our banners, enabling each of them to focus on a particular customer set, whether it's on the performance end of the spectrum, such as Foot Locker, Eastbay, Runners Point and SIX:02, or the lifestyle end, such as Footaction, Sidestep and CCS. Meanwhile, Champs Sports is able to effectively serve customers across a broad athletic spectrum. \r\nFourth, we're no longer just a U.S.-focused company with a modest international presence. We are now a large global company. Including our franchise partners, we operate well over 1,000 stores in 29 countries outside the U.S., and along with our international and local country digital sites, we're approaching $2 billion in international sales.\r\nAnd finally, we're not just a bricks-and-mortar business. We have a strong, fast-growing collection of digital sites, both in the U.S. and abroad, and we've grown our digital sales to be more than 10% of our total sales.\r\nAll of these strengths have provided us with an exciting number of opportunities to drive our business forward in the coming years. Fortunately, some of these opportunities are having an impact now, and we expect that they will continue to do so over the relatively near term, which I define as the next -- into the next year. These include, first, our children's business, across not just Kids Foot Locker where sales increased at a mid-teen pace in 2013, but across all of our banners, channels and geographies.\r\nSecond, growth in Europe, where we have seen recovery in most of our markets and where Germany, given the Runners Point acquisition, is now our largest market. In the near term, we'll focus on customer segmentation inside Germany and expansion of the Foot Locker banner in markets where we believe we are under-penetrated.\r\nThird, improvements in our running and apparel business. Both of these categories are strong, but growth slowed in 2013. Looking ahead, we have a promising pipeline of premium running products from many vendors, including Nike, Adidas, ASICS, Under Armour, Mizuno, New Balance and Puma. \r\nFourth, continued expansion of specialized presentations in our stores, in partnership with our vendors. With Nike, these include the House of Hoops, Yardline, Kids Fly Zone and Jordan Flight 23 shops. With Adidas, we have the Adi Collective and original shops. And we recently opened our first 2 Puma Performance Labs. \r\nFifth, we will continue to enhance the connectivity between our store banners and our banner e-commerce sites. We're stepping up our investments make the sites more engaging, entertaining and shopper friendly.\r\nFinally, we use technology to improve our customer service, inventory effectiveness and productivity of our sales associates. \r\nIn the intermediate term of, say, 2 to 3 years, we have additional opportunities to build on our momentum. Examples include: the cumulative sales lift of our store remodel programs as we start to hit critical mass; the potential expansion of the Runners Point and Sidestep banners outside their current markets; investing in technology, the most prominent example of which is the new merchandise allocation system we intend to roll out later this year; and the development of a more meaningful team sales and services business. And Dick spoke about what is perhaps our biggest single, long-term opportunity, the women's business. Between the promising SIX:02 banner and the merchandise assortment changes we're making to Lady Foot Locker, we believe we can create a large, profitable women's business.\r\nThat's a lot of opportunities to seize upon and not all of them will develop exactly how and when we have envisioned. But the breadth of promising growth and profit opportunities I've just listed make for a very exciting future for Foot Locker, not just this year, but, I believe, for many years to come.\r\nNow before we get to your questions, let me hand the call back to Lauren to talk more about the specifics of how we're planning 2014 and all the news that you've been waiting to hear. Lauren?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nThanks, Ken. As you mentioned in the press release this morning, we are planning for a mid-single-digit comparable sales gain and a double-digit percentage EPS increase during 2014. Many of the themes from 2013 we expect to carry over into 2014, with one notable exception, which is, thankfully, we don't have to worry about significant quarterly sales shift caused by that extra week in 2012. So in fact, we are planning for mid-single-digit comp sales gains in each quarter. Until July, remember, we will have incremental sales from Runners Point Group, at which point their sales and expenses will be in both periods. RPG sales will be in our consolidated comp numbers starting in October. \r\nOn the gross margin front, we expect to experience some ongoing initial market pressure, but we believe we can continue to improve our markdown rates to hold merchandise margin relatively steady in 2014. And we should pick up leverage of our fixed costs to generate an overall gross margin gain of about 30 to 50 basis points. We should also lever the fixed elements of SG&A to produce a 20 to 30 basis point improvement in our SG&A expense rate, where we are currently planning for depreciation and amortization expense to increase to a range of $145 million to $150 million this year.\r\nOur interest expense, we see being flat with last year at around $5 million. Meanwhile, as I alluded to before, our tax team has done a terrific job implementing various tax planning initiatives. And going forward into 2014, we are now are expecting a 36.5% effective tax rate, down from our prior expectation of 37%. We're planning for a $220 million capital expenditure program in 2014. \r\nWe're anticipating about 60 new stores and will likely close about 100. We'll spend about the same amount this year on store remodels. At about 300, the number of projects in 2014 will be close to the number that the team executed last year. The balance of the capital program will be spent on our technology initiatives, our digital sites, our logistics and other facilities and our regular store maintenance requirements.\r\nWe have $371 million left on our share repurchase program, which, as you have seen, we were active in executing during the period of 2013. We expect the share count to continue decreasing as we execute this program. We intend to be disciplined with our inventory growth in 2014 with a goal of ensuring that inventory increases at no more than half the rate of sales growth. That inventory discipline has served us and the entire industry well in recent years. It also set us up for a solid start to 2014, and in fact, our comparable sales are up low-double digits so far in the first quarter through yesterday.\r\nThat said, there's still a long, long way to go in the quarter and the year, so we're going to stay focused on executing our initiatives. In a meeting earlier this week, Ken said something about it being a good to score a touchdown on the first possession of the game. It's certainly better than snapping the ball into the end zone for safety. But it doesn't mean you're going to win the game if the team doesn't keep playing its best. So with that bit of good news, let's get to your questions now. \r\nJohn, just to inform you that we have so many people in the queue to ask questions, that we may not be able to get to everyone on this call. [Operator Instructions] Operator?",
      "transcript_text3": "Lauren, one quick question. Could you just clarify the merchandise margins versus the buy-in occupancy in the fourth quarter for us? I apologize if I missed that in the comments.\n\n---\n\nYes, we picked up in the fourth quarter 10 basis points improvement. So we got some leverage out of the occupancy. We gave it back in merchandise margins, net to that 10 improvement.\n\n---\n\nThat's based on a 13-week to 13-week comparison.\n\n---\n\nOkay. You're not breaking out both components though?\n\n---\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And can we just back up a minute and chat a little bit about Champs. I think the -- you said that the comps at Champs were negative in the quarter. I think they were as well in the third quarter. I know that that's been a focus of the remodeling program, and I think the stores come out of the comp base as a remodel. Perhaps, that's what it is. But if you could just give us a little bit of the components behind what you're seeing at Champs and maybe the trajectory for that chain here this year.\n\n---\n\nYes, the stores don't come out the comp mix when we remodel and they stay in. But one of the things that we talked about was the apparel being down slightly in the quarter, and you know that Champs has a great licensed product business. And the teams that we had in the playoffs, both professionally and in the college, ranks were not the same level, not at the same level of sales as the year prior. So you combine that with a few late remodels, and I think that explains. We believe that by the end of '14, we'll have touched 30% of the chain. So we think it will be a critical mass there with the remodels on the Champs.\n\n---\n\nDo you -- can I just ask you, do you think you expect the Champs business to be positive in 2014?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nA couple of questions. The first one is just on the comp momentum you're seeing now quarter-to-date. Could you talk about what may -- what is driving that? And then the sort of confidence in maintaining mid-single-digit comps through 2014, Ken or Dick, could you talk about the spring pipeline, key exclusives that you may have and then what sort of the apparel or approach or assumption in maintaining those mid-single-digit comps? And then I have a follow-up.\n\n---\n\nYes, February, obviously, is an important basketball month. So we feel good about where February ended, obviously, and where we are quarter-to-date. We think the pipeline, as Ken mentioned, I think, in his comments from a running perspective, we got great running silhouettes coming from many, many vendors, along with great basketball performance product. And we have extended the basketball season certainly beyond the traditional season. So we're fairly optimistic on the apparel front. Obviously, we continue to make changes to a more performance-based assortment in many of our banners. We see great opportunities with Under Armour apparel, with Nike apparel. So I think that we've got a pretty good confidence level, Robbie, that the mid-single-digit number is achievable.\n\n---\n\nAnd the other question I have was on Europe. Could you remind us roughly where the operating margin in Europe has been and where do you think you could take it to over the next couple of years, if you're successful with Runners Point and some of the initiatives you have going on over there?\n\n---\n\nThe operating margins have improved, both in the U.S. and internationally. And we think that we still have upside opportunity in both. There's a bit less promotional environment in Europe, so that certainly helps. But remember that we've been adding stores in -- at Europe. So you don't get the full flow through that you do when you're just talking about comps.\n\n---\n\nI guess, one of my big questions is, when you say -- I know you don't -- you're not going to update sort of your long-term targets. But if you kind of back into some of the assumptions here, you're going to be pretty close to your 11% EBIT margin in 2014. Just any thoughts about, really, where you think this business can go to? And any thoughts about how we should think about that as we move forward? Obviously, it seems like there's opportunity for that to go higher. Just some thoughts around that.\n\n---\n\nYes, Chris. We do believe, based upon what I've talked about a number of times, the continued leverage that we get with productivity. And I think one of the things that proudest of that we've done is to increase productivity of all of our assets: our real estate, our people and our inventory. We think that as we continue to get things right in apparel and are continuing to improve there and develop a stronger business there, continue to improve in women's and develop that business, we're seeing green shoots on the new formats that we talked about, plus the women's business and the other banners improving there, and the new allocation system that we're putting in. All will help us continue to drive the overall profitability. And obviously, it's not -- it can't be infinite, but we think we still have upside there.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just on the apparel. I'm just curious, any color between private label and the branded side? And I guess, as you think about 2014, do you think there's opportunity to actually comp positive in apparel as you think about the product pipeline and what you're doing?\n\n---\n\nYes, we definitely believe that we can improve our apparel business. We continue to, on our private label, pull down the commodity elements and build ideas. We've got a women's brand that's doing well called Actra. We've got a brand in Europe called Sneaker Freak that's doing well. So our Champs Sports gear has done well. So we got the ability to develop a better element in our private label. The transition is a bit of a challenge as you pull something down and build something up. You can pull down faster than you can build up. We also believe that the continued development of the premium apparel and how we show that and what we show is becoming more important. So our plans for this year are positive apparel.\n\n---\n\nMy question is on Runners Point. You mentioned that it came in at a slight profit during the quarter. Do you have an ultimate goal for the profitability of that banner?\n\n---\n\nI don't see why it couldn't run the profits that we do in the rest of our European business.\n\n---\n\nAnd is there any -- I know you've been very happy with their e-commerce platform. Is there any chance that it could be more profitable because of that?\n\n---\n\nThat's one of the reasons why we, Kate, why we think it can be more profitable. They've got the strong Tredex business. But they are a slightly different model. They have a smaller store. They replenish more frequently. And we actually think there's some things that we can learn because we have smaller stores in Europe than we do in the States from them on some of those supply chain elements, as well as they can learn from us on things like the allocation and distribution of products. So we believe that there's an opportunity for continued profitability improvement. And as Lauren said, there's not a governor on it that would say it couldn't get to the level of the rest of the company. They were a profitable company when we bought them. But as we work and continue to leverage both the corporate office that we have there plus the real estate, inventory and people, we feel very good about Runners Point.\n\n---\n\nJust more questions about the store remodels. Can you give us on the -- like, clearly, you've got some significant lift over on kids. Can you talk to me about, with Champs, maybe the differential between the overall underperformance and those particular stores that have been done in the quarter or last year because you did -- we were a little negative there? Were the other -- were redos up?\n\n---\n\nYes, the remodels are up. We don't really break the chain apart, Sam, in detail. But as I said in my comments, we monitor all the performance of all the remodel stores, and they all meet -- they meet our hurdles. We make adjustments along the way. So I think getting to critical mass with the Champs stores, having 30% of them remodeled by the end of the year, will all play positive in the Champs business.\n\n---\n\nWe wouldn't be going forward with them, Sam, if we -- if they weren't performing well and performing better. And obviously, one of the things that it does, it allows us to better show the apparel, which is a stronger business with them, with the shoes. And so we've gotten good reaction from the customers on the new format.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just real quick on a follow-up...\n\n---\n\nAnd one other thing to keep in mind, the kids -- about remodels, the kids stores were probably the easiest and most straightforward. And almost all of our kids stores have been reconfigured. They're not really a remodel, but reconfigured. So one of the things that has helped the kids business is that we've had that reconfiguring in all the chain. And the others are -- it's more of a process than it was in kids.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just real quick on Runners Point Group. Can you talk about what kind of -- I mean, what kind of accretion that you think you'll get this year from it and how you think -- what kind of accretion you're going to get from it and what kind of sales growth you're going to get from it as well?\n\n---\n\nYes, as you know, we don't break out divisions individually, but we do feel great about Runners Point will contribute this year. As Dick mentioned, spring is, with their running depth, is very important to that business.\n\n---\n\nCan you talk about the business intelligence system, the localization initiative and kind of how this -- when this is rolling out and the opportunity here over a multiyear period?\n\n---\n\nWe've got in BI in place right now. And I think that merchants are doing a great job of understanding the market basket, what's being sold together, how the transactions are being put together in the stores. So that's something that, from a localization point of view, we're already doing and working on. I think Ken and Lauren and I have all mentioned the merchandise allocation system, which is a much more detailed, much more in-depth process and initiative, that we'll test this year, and we'll be in a position, hopefully, to roll out completely in 2015.\n\n---\n\nThe advantage that, that gives us, quite frankly, is it allow us to better utilize the BI information that we have. Right now, we're getting BI information and we're inputting in our current systems. But we feel the new allocation system will allow us to better utilize the localized information in terms of products, sizes, quantities, things like that.\n\n---\n\nAnd it will really help us take assortment planning to the next level and, of course, because that's a planning impact that bears fruit as we go forward. And we're excited about BI. Really, that information has legs beyond product. And so we're starting to see how it might be used to help us with operations and some other things.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then can you just touch on what the basis for the acceleration quarter-to-date? And do you think there's some pent-up demand on the running side, given the weather that we have had as we head into the spring here?\n\n---\n\nWell, we certainly -- basketball is a big deal in February, with the All-Star game and all of the events and the launches that happen in February. So that's certainly been one of the things that's driven the quarter. And a general belief in the U.S. is, yes, there's probably some pent-up demand on the running side. But again, remember, as Ken mentioned, we are a stronger global business at this point and this winter has not been as difficult in many of the markets in Europe. So our running business was actually up in Europe for the quarter. So in the U.S., I would say, yes, we see some pent-up demand and believe that there will be some, when winter breaks, and it will inevitably break, we see some good things.\n\n---\n\nJust I was actually -- I'm wondering if you could update us on your thoughts about expansion, net expansion this year. It looks like another year of net store closures. And as you think about the comments earlier on maybe taking Runners Point Group outside of its core markets, how do we think about that longer term just in general?\n\n---\n\nWell, in -- one of the things, and it's a little deceptive in terms of expansion because when you look at expansion, as we are closing some of our less productive stores, one of the things that we're doing is we're adding, too. We've got now well over 100 House of Hoops that makes our --- make our stores bigger, things like adding the Collective or the Puma Labs or the kids Fly Zone. Those are where we are taking more square footage, but cutting down on the number of locations and helping our overall productivity, both in terms of space. So I think -- several years ago, I was thinking, \"Okay, you got to grow stores.\" We have a couple of things going on, both in terms -- or first, in terms of just the overall productivity that we're able to drive out of one location. The second is the addition, which causes larger stores with regard to the new concepts that we're putting in the stores. And the third is the growth of Dot-Com and the ability for that to help -- to make us more productive, not only online, but in our stores. So I think what we're going to see is kind of a holding pattern around a level of stores, but much more productive. We finished the year $465 a foot. 2 -- 4 years ago, we were doing $320 a foot. So that's over in 3, 4 years, 1/3 improvement in the productivity. With regard to Runners Point, we want to get to -- know that business a little bit better. But we believe that based upon the success that we've had with them, based upon some testing we're doing by focusing their formats, we have the ability to expand the Runners Point stores and the Sidestep stores into other markets. And the interesting thing about that is, there are some markets, Italy, for example, that probably would be more receptive of Sidestep, and there are other markets, such as Scandinavia or Holland, that would be more receptive of Runners Point. I don't see that many Italians out running a lot, but they do want to look good. And so we think that -- and that's why we put it in that, the mid-time frame, as an opportunity that we can start expanding those chains into other markets than just the greater Germany.\n\n---\n\nIf I could, just on the digital business, Ken. I mean, now greater than 10% of the mix. Maybe just kind of update us again on strategy. Is there an optimal sort of size of that business that you're thinking about? Clearly, we saw somewhat of an inflection this holiday season in retail in general, in terms of a sort of migration to online. Really, just sort of an update there from a banner perspective and the opportunities that you have going forward.\n\n---\n\nYes, our -- first of all, I think that last holiday was a little deceptive because 3 weekends in a row before Christmas, where you have a big chunk of the country cut off from shopping, has an impact. Plus, the industry didn't help itself with the missed deliveries. That said, it's going to continue to grow. And we're prepared for it. And we're doing a number of things. One, we're updating our sites and what's on our sites and how they work. We've really -- I think, when you look at some of the new sites, you look at the new SIX:02 site, you look at our new Footaction site, they are different and they behave differently than each other. We show more hookups and outfits in -- on the Footaction site. You can go to SIX:02 and do intelligent search. So we continue to update and upgrade that. We're looking at how we can bring more of that to the store and connect it to the store. We've added buy online, ship to store, buy online purchase, pick up in store. You can order in a store something that they don't have in their inventory and have it shipped to you. So we've got a whole bunch of things that we're doing to connect the stores and the internet. We are looking at things that we can do to connect even more, and we're going to test something. We're not ready to announce it yet, but we're looking at a new idea that we'll test some time, hopefully, this summer. But there is a significant opportunity to continue to grow and develop the Dot-Com business, and not necessarily at the expense of the store, if we put them together. Because the most used sites on our websites happen to be store connected, store locator, inventory, things like that, and we're going to make sure that we are able to give our associates something so they're better connected. We're using handheld devices and all-in-one devices in the store. So we're using technology as an opportunity. It will grow. What the peak is, as I told everybody, you set a goal of 10%. Now the 10%, by the way, is the banner.com and we're not there yet. We did have a banner past the 10%, but we've got to get all the banners up over it. And as we do here and was alluded to earlier, when we get that goal, we'll set a new one and we'll move beyond. I think there is some limit. What that limit is, is it 20%, is it 30%, is it 40%? I don't know yet. But...\n\n---\n\nThe customer will tell us.\n\n---\n\nThe customer will tell us because we're going to be able to grow both ways. What we want to do is give the customer the product the way they want it.\n\n---\n\nThat's perfect. And then just real quick for Lauren. As we think about the gross margin next year, leverage on occupancy, but maybe still a little bit maintained on that IMU, as we think about that relative to opportunities to mix up price, and I know there's certain segments of the business that are perhaps dragging on that but we also know Nike, in particular, is starting to test and push some pricing, particularly within basketball, so is there an opportunity there as you think about the pipeline for the year and some opportunities for upside on that IMU if, in fact, you take some pricing?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think we continue to work with our merchants and try to figure out where the price sensitivity is. There's a lot of categories were there may be a lot bit of upside. But we continue to face some pressures. And I think that -- I don't see it being significantly different in '14 than it was in '13.\n\n---\n\nBut that's really why we stay very focused on what are our other opportunities to improve that merchandise margin, and there are other things that we can do. We work internally and very collaborative with our vendors on figuring out how to flow the products better and the allocation system is going to help us make sure that we got it at the right place, right time. All of those things come together to help us do more business at full price, and that gives us some room there on that margin.\n\n---\n\nYes, we believe and we work closely with our vendors to make sure that we get the best IMU and margin possible. But our focus is not -- we're not like the United Nations. Our focus isn't based upon negotiating with other people. Our focus is on what we can do. We will negotiate with the vendors to try to get as much as we can. And they work with us because they want us to be strong, too. But at the same time, we're going to focus on what we can do. And so that's why the things you hear us talk about, the numbers you hear us talk about, are what we believe we can do.\n\n---\n\nIf I could just follow up on the remodel work that you guys have done. It sounds like you're pleased with the improvement in sales that you're seeing in some of these stores. Just trying to dig in a little bit further where that improvement is actually coming from. Do you have a sense of, are you getting better traffic in those locations, maybe some incremental customers, or you're seeing better conversion, more attachments with the apparel assortment? Just trying to get a better picture of what's going on there.\n\n---\n\nAll of the above. I mean, I think when we remodel a store, that's an excitement to the mall. So we see traffic come up. I think the ability to hook up and show through adjacent product, the footwear and apparel hooks, our accessory hooks, is improved in all of the formats that we're rolling out. And I think that ability to hook up changes our conversion in those stores. So I think that all of those levers work. And I think that the reasons that we've gone through the remodels are to do just that, to increase the flow of traffic, to make the floor more productive, to allow us to convert and hook up with a bigger basket going out the doors.\n\n---\n\nYes, one of the things that happens in retailers is sometimes you say, \"Well, I want to change the format and do something.\" And normally, in my life, when the retailer does that, it's nice, but you don't see the impact. I give Dick and his team a lot of credit because we're seeing the impact from these remodels. And as we said, we've got criteria. They're meeting and exceeding the criteria. So it's a good thing.\n\n---\n\nOkay, got it. And it sounds like apparel is a big piece there. Is there any way to quantify the apparel penetration in those stores versus the non-remodeled stores with the company average, something along those lines?\n\n---\n\nYes, there is, but we don't disclose it. We monitor it very closely. But if you look at the stores, one of the things that stands out more is that we've got a better balance between apparel and footwear.\n\n---\n\nOkay, sure. One other driver that you mentioned was the development of a more meaningful team sales and service business. You haven't really talked about that much recently. I mean, where is that business today? What's the opportunity there?\n\n---\n\nWe -- it's a $2 billion business. All the players are pretty small. We had significant growth with the business this past year. We see the opportunity. We're in 11 states, and we're going to continue to build those 11. We're going to continue to slowly add more. We're going to figure out how we can better hook the Eastbay and team sales. So we -- I feel very good about it. This business should be well over $100 million business. And that's what we're working towards. We're professionalizing something that is kind of not very professional out there, but it's a big business.\n\n---\n\nWanted to just go back to the conversation around the women's business. $1 billion is a big number. If you can just drill down a little bit more on what we should expect from the SIX:02 format as you continue to test that this year, what we think about how to drive growth in Lady Foot Locker long term. And is there any other avenues to reach that target outside of just these 2 formats?\n\n---\n\nWell, we have 3 elements in our women's business. First is the Lady Foot Locker, which is our biggest direct women's business. And the thing that we know is apparel is a more important part. And we are, through the new Bridgewater format, which is basically a less expensive version of parks, we're able to get a nice pickup with the apparel by putting more apparel in, what the assortment is. And we feel very good about where we are with that. And we will roll that out. We're starting to roll that out this year, and we will have a number of stores that we'll be putting in place. The second part of it is SIX:02. We were pleased with where we are in SIX:02, but we know we still -- there's still some tweaks and improvements. So we're modifying the stores we have. We've got a few more stores we're going to be opening up this year. And we would hope by the end of this year, we'll have a pretty good feel, and that's something that we can move on and roll out. And then the third element are the women's shoes and all of our other banners. And that is a sizable business. And we are better defining what Foot Locker Women's is, what Champs Sports Women's is. And as we do that between our female banners, which are very performance-driven; Foot Locker, which will be more fashion; Champs, which will be a mix of fashion and performance, we'll have a very strong business. And it's a $40 billion plus business at our level. I'm not including the discount level, $40 billion plus business. There's not a player that really has the heart and minds of that woman. We're going to work to do that. And we've got a team, I think, that's dedicated to that and we're pushing on it pretty hard.\n\n---\n\nAnd we've got women's opportunities around the globe as well. We sell a lot of women's shoes in Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand. When you think about Runners Point, half of the people that run are women. So again, great assortment opportunities around the globe, as well as in the U.S.\n\n---\n\nGood call.\n\n---\n\nAnd just a quick follow-up, since you're mentioning those other countries, Dick. There's been no conversation about further international expansion. Obviously, I understand you have RPG still hasn't even been a year yet, and you can roll out that format into other countries. But is there any thought process about further global expansion, particularly some of the bigger emerging market countries out there like Brazil and China?\n\n---\n\nWe constantly look and evaluate and determine where we think we could develop a meaningful and profitable business. I think that talking into people in our business, they would've -- they said the last year, \"Who would have thought our 2 most developing countries are North America and Western Europe?\" Some of the developing countries are having some significant challenges now. And we will evaluate and look and see when the right time is. But right now, we've got tremendous opportunities where we are.\n\n---\n\nAnd we insist on things, meeting our hurdle rates no matter where they are in the globe. So we have to be confident if we do that.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to just kind of dig more into this disparity between running and basketball. I get that the weather was obviously unfavorable for running. But I guess, what percentage of your customer is actually using this product for end use? And I guess, the reason why I'm asking is, there's obviously a very easy excuse for the running business, but is it really all weather? Is there an ASP thing going on there? Is fashion playing a role?\n\n---\n\nNo, I mean, let's face it, the majority of our shoes are not used for performance. But we had -- there's some been tremendous development between Kobes, KDs, Lebrons, Jordan, that have really helped basketball. We are seeing this spring a plethora of running that will help running. So there's new product. You've got the new BOOST. You've got new Flys coming out. You've got the new shoes from Under Armour. There's a lot of new product coming that I feel will help running. So yes, the weather did have an impact, but it was the newness. There's some fashion. In fact, you look at some of the basketball shoes, they have a tendency to look more like running shoes. But I think that the new ideas -- yes, I'm looking at some shoes here, some KDs that John's wearing, they look like running shoes. But what I think is that this will balance out. And we sell through all of our channels. We sell as many running shoes as anybody else out there. But we've got a stronger position with some great brands, and we will continue to be a leader there.\n\n---\n\nAnd what about this idea? I know there was that Women's Wear Daily article a couple of weeks ago about white shoes making a comeback. I think, Dick, you're actually quoted in that article. Is that a big deal? Or is that small? And what does it actually mean for your business?\n\n---\n\nWell, casual, white on white, black on black shoes are -- they're always a base business. They ebb and flow. And when you look at things like Air Force 1s, classic clean K-Swiss shoes, they have their moments. And right now, it feels like we're going into one of those moments. So as Ken talks about the legs on our stool, one of those legs is casual footwear, and certainly, the clean white plays into that casual footwear leg.\n\n---\n\nKen, with regard to the banners and digital, could you go over a little bit of the experience in developing those banners digitally? Because that was a little bit late in coming relative to the digital cycle. How far along are you? You said that you've made a major differentiations among banners. What can we expect over the next few years?\n\n---\n\nWell, first of all, we really didn't get into the digital business, pushed the digital banners until a couple of years ago. We were focused on Eastbay. And Dowe and his team, I think, are doing a much better job balancing that, still pushing Eastbay, but also developing the digital banners when you look at footlocker.com, champssports.com and connecting them with the stores. So we now are much more coordinated in what we do with the stores and dot-com. It used to be if they had the same shoe up, go buy a lottery ticket that day because that was pure luck. Now they're talking constantly. I talked about the connection with buy online, ship to store; buy online, purchase in store; the inventory lookup using our stock locator. So the connection and giving -- I was just down at our team weeks for both the Foot Locker and Champs in the field leadership there and they were talking about how many shoes you have in your inventory and your store. And I'd say, \"Well, I've got extra.\" You've got 250,000 SKUs and I go, wow, because you got that stock locator. And we're seeing much more of that. We've updated a couple of the sites. We have more to update. We will continue to improve and adapt. We will continue to put more technology in the store. So I would say, we are still in the early innings. I feel that we're as far along as anybody else is. We probably don't toot our horn as much as other people. But we are as strong as, I think, anybody is out there in the capability that is meaningful and important to the customer. Thanks, Bernie, and thanks, everybody, for the call.\n\n---\n\nYes, thank you for participating on the call today, and we look forward to giving you an update on our next call, which is tentatively scheduled for May 3. Thank you very much.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Michael Binetti (Analysts)】\nLauren, one quick question. Could you just clarify the merchandise margins versus the buy-in occupancy in the fourth quarter for us? I apologize if I missed that in the comments.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nYes, we picked up in the fourth quarter 10 basis points improvement. So we got some leverage out of the occupancy. We gave it back in merchandise margins, net to that 10 improvement.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Maurer (Executives)】\nThat's based on a 13-week to 13-week comparison.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Binetti (Analysts)】\nOkay. You're not breaking out both components though?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nNo.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Binetti (Analysts)】\nOkay. And can we just back up a minute and chat a little bit about Champs. I think the -- you said that the comps at Champs were negative in the quarter. I think they were as well in the third quarter. I know that that's been a focus of the remodeling program, and I think the stores come out of the comp base as a remodel. Perhaps, that's what it is. But if you could just give us a little bit of the components behind what you're seeing at Champs and maybe the trajectory for that chain here this year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nYes, the stores don't come out the comp mix when we remodel and they stay in. But one of the things that we talked about was the apparel being down slightly in the quarter, and you know that Champs has a great licensed product business. And the teams that we had in the playoffs, both professionally and in the college, ranks were not the same level, not at the same level of sales as the year prior. So you combine that with a few late remodels, and I think that explains. We believe that by the end of '14, we'll have touched 30% of the chain. So we think it will be a critical mass there with the remodels on the Champs.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Binetti (Analysts)】\nDo you -- can I just ask you, do you think you expect the Champs business to be positive in 2014?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nA couple of questions. The first one is just on the comp momentum you're seeing now quarter-to-date. Could you talk about what may -- what is driving that? And then the sort of confidence in maintaining mid-single-digit comps through 2014, Ken or Dick, could you talk about the spring pipeline, key exclusives that you may have and then what sort of the apparel or approach or assumption in maintaining those mid-single-digit comps? And then I have a follow-up.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nYes, February, obviously, is an important basketball month. So we feel good about where February ended, obviously, and where we are quarter-to-date. We think the pipeline, as Ken mentioned, I think, in his comments from a running perspective, we got great running silhouettes coming from many, many vendors, along with great basketball performance product. And we have extended the basketball season certainly beyond the traditional season. So we're fairly optimistic on the apparel front. Obviously, we continue to make changes to a more performance-based assortment in many of our banners. We see great opportunities with Under Armour apparel, with Nike apparel. So I think that we've got a pretty good confidence level, Robbie, that the mid-single-digit number is achievable.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nAnd the other question I have was on Europe. Could you remind us roughly where the operating margin in Europe has been and where do you think you could take it to over the next couple of years, if you're successful with Runners Point and some of the initiatives you have going on over there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nThe operating margins have improved, both in the U.S. and internationally. And we think that we still have upside opportunity in both. There's a bit less promotional environment in Europe, so that certainly helps. But remember that we've been adding stores in -- at Europe. So you don't get the full flow through that you do when you're just talking about comps.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Svezia (Analysts)】\nI guess, one of my big questions is, when you say -- I know you don't -- you're not going to update sort of your long-term targets. But if you kind of back into some of the assumptions here, you're going to be pretty close to your 11% EBIT margin in 2014. Just any thoughts about, really, where you think this business can go to? And any thoughts about how we should think about that as we move forward? Obviously, it seems like there's opportunity for that to go higher. Just some thoughts around that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Hicks (Executives)】\nYes, Chris. We do believe, based upon what I've talked about a number of times, the continued leverage that we get with productivity. And I think one of the things that proudest of that we've done is to increase productivity of all of our assets: our real estate, our people and our inventory. We think that as we continue to get things right in apparel and are continuing to improve there and develop a stronger business there, continue to improve in women's and develop that business, we're seeing green shoots on the new formats that we talked about, plus the women's business and the other banners improving there, and the new allocation system that we're putting in. All will help us continue to drive the overall profitability. And obviously, it's not -- it can't be infinite, but we think we still have upside there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Svezia (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just on the apparel. I'm just curious, any color between private label and the branded side? And I guess, as you think about 2014, do you think there's opportunity to actually comp positive in apparel as you think about the product pipeline and what you're doing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Hicks (Executives)】\nYes, we definitely believe that we can improve our apparel business. We continue to, on our private label, pull down the commodity elements and build ideas. We've got a women's brand that's doing well called Actra. We've got a brand in Europe called Sneaker Freak that's doing well. So our Champs Sports gear has done well. So we got the ability to develop a better element in our private label. The transition is a bit of a challenge as you pull something down and build something up. You can pull down faster than you can build up. We also believe that the continued development of the premium apparel and how we show that and what we show is becoming more important. So our plans for this year are positive apparel.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kate McShane (Analysts)】\nMy question is on Runners Point. You mentioned that it came in at a slight profit during the quarter. Do you have an ultimate goal for the profitability of that banner?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nI don't see why it couldn't run the profits that we do in the rest of our European business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kate McShane (Analysts)】\nAnd is there any -- I know you've been very happy with their e-commerce platform. Is there any chance that it could be more profitable because of that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Hicks (Executives)】\nThat's one of the reasons why we, Kate, why we think it can be more profitable. They've got the strong Tredex business. But they are a slightly different model. They have a smaller store. They replenish more frequently. And we actually think there's some things that we can learn because we have smaller stores in Europe than we do in the States from them on some of those supply chain elements, as well as they can learn from us on things like the allocation and distribution of products. So we believe that there's an opportunity for continued profitability improvement. And as Lauren said, there's not a governor on it that would say it couldn't get to the level of the rest of the company. They were a profitable company when we bought them. But as we work and continue to leverage both the corporate office that we have there plus the real estate, inventory and people, we feel very good about Runners Point.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sam Poser (Analysts)】\nJust more questions about the store remodels. Can you give us on the -- like, clearly, you've got some significant lift over on kids. Can you talk to me about, with Champs, maybe the differential between the overall underperformance and those particular stores that have been done in the quarter or last year because you did -- we were a little negative there? Were the other -- were redos up?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nYes, the remodels are up. We don't really break the chain apart, Sam, in detail. But as I said in my comments, we monitor all the performance of all the remodel stores, and they all meet -- they meet our hurdles. We make adjustments along the way. So I think getting to critical mass with the Champs stores, having 30% of them remodeled by the end of the year, will all play positive in the Champs business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Hicks (Executives)】\nWe wouldn't be going forward with them, Sam, if we -- if they weren't performing well and performing better. And obviously, one of the things that it does, it allows us to better show the apparel, which is a stronger business with them, with the shoes. And so we've gotten good reaction from the customers on the new format.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sam Poser (Analysts)】\nAnd then just real quick on a follow-up...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Hicks (Executives)】\nAnd one other thing to keep in mind, the kids -- about remodels, the kids stores were probably the easiest and most straightforward. And almost all of our kids stores have been reconfigured. They're not really a remodel, but reconfigured. So one of the things that has helped the kids business is that we've had that reconfiguring in all the chain. And the others are -- it's more of a process than it was in kids.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sam Poser (Analysts)】\nAnd then just real quick on Runners Point Group. Can you talk about what kind of -- I mean, what kind of accretion that you think you'll get this year from it and how you think -- what kind of accretion you're going to get from it and what kind of sales growth you're going to get from it as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nYes, as you know, we don't break out divisions individually, but we do feel great about Runners Point will contribute this year. As Dick mentioned, spring is, with their running depth, is very important to that business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Boss (Analysts)】\nCan you talk about the business intelligence system, the localization initiative and kind of how this -- when this is rolling out and the opportunity here over a multiyear period?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nWe've got in BI in place right now. And I think that merchants are doing a great job of understanding the market basket, what's being sold together, how the transactions are being put together in the stores. So that's something that, from a localization point of view, we're already doing and working on. I think Ken and Lauren and I have all mentioned the merchandise allocation system, which is a much more detailed, much more in-depth process and initiative, that we'll test this year, and we'll be in a position, hopefully, to roll out completely in 2015.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Hicks (Executives)】\nThe advantage that, that gives us, quite frankly, is it allow us to better utilize the BI information that we have. Right now, we're getting BI information and we're inputting in our current systems. But we feel the new allocation system will allow us to better utilize the localized information in terms of products, sizes, quantities, things like that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nAnd it will really help us take assortment planning to the next level and, of course, because that's a planning impact that bears fruit as we go forward. And we're excited about BI. Really, that information has legs beyond product. And so we're starting to see how it might be used to help us with operations and some other things.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Boss (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then can you just touch on what the basis for the acceleration quarter-to-date? And do you think there's some pent-up demand on the running side, given the weather that we have had as we head into the spring here?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nWell, we certainly -- basketball is a big deal in February, with the All-Star game and all of the events and the launches that happen in February. So that's certainly been one of the things that's driven the quarter. And a general belief in the U.S. is, yes, there's probably some pent-up demand on the running side. But again, remember, as Ken mentioned, we are a stronger global business at this point and this winter has not been as difficult in many of the markets in Europe. So our running business was actually up in Europe for the quarter. So in the U.S., I would say, yes, we see some pent-up demand and believe that there will be some, when winter breaks, and it will inevitably break, we see some good things.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew McClintock (Analysts)】\nJust I was actually -- I'm wondering if you could update us on your thoughts about expansion, net expansion this year. It looks like another year of net store closures. And as you think about the comments earlier on maybe taking Runners Point Group outside of its core markets, how do we think about that longer term just in general?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Hicks (Executives)】\nWell, in -- one of the things, and it's a little deceptive in terms of expansion because when you look at expansion, as we are closing some of our less productive stores, one of the things that we're doing is we're adding, too. We've got now well over 100 House of Hoops that makes our --- make our stores bigger, things like adding the Collective or the Puma Labs or the kids Fly Zone. Those are where we are taking more square footage, but cutting down on the number of locations and helping our overall productivity, both in terms of space. So I think -- several years ago, I was thinking, \"Okay, you got to grow stores.\" We have a couple of things going on, both in terms -- or first, in terms of just the overall productivity that we're able to drive out of one location. The second is the addition, which causes larger stores with regard to the new concepts that we're putting in the stores. And the third is the growth of Dot-Com and the ability for that to help -- to make us more productive, not only online, but in our stores. So I think what we're going to see is kind of a holding pattern around a level of stores, but much more productive. We finished the year $465 a foot. 2 -- 4 years ago, we were doing $320 a foot. So that's over in 3, 4 years, 1/3 improvement in the productivity. With regard to Runners Point, we want to get to -- know that business a little bit better. But we believe that based upon the success that we've had with them, based upon some testing we're doing by focusing their formats, we have the ability to expand the Runners Point stores and the Sidestep stores into other markets. And the interesting thing about that is, there are some markets, Italy, for example, that probably would be more receptive of Sidestep, and there are other markets, such as Scandinavia or Holland, that would be more receptive of Runners Point. I don't see that many Italians out running a lot, but they do want to look good. And so we think that -- and that's why we put it in that, the mid-time frame, as an opportunity that we can start expanding those chains into other markets than just the greater Germany.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Tracy (Analysts)】\nIf I could, just on the digital business, Ken. I mean, now greater than 10% of the mix. Maybe just kind of update us again on strategy. Is there an optimal sort of size of that business that you're thinking about? Clearly, we saw somewhat of an inflection this holiday season in retail in general, in terms of a sort of migration to online. Really, just sort of an update there from a banner perspective and the opportunities that you have going forward.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Hicks (Executives)】\nYes, our -- first of all, I think that last holiday was a little deceptive because 3 weekends in a row before Christmas, where you have a big chunk of the country cut off from shopping, has an impact. Plus, the industry didn't help itself with the missed deliveries. That said, it's going to continue to grow. And we're prepared for it. And we're doing a number of things. One, we're updating our sites and what's on our sites and how they work. We've really -- I think, when you look at some of the new sites, you look at the new SIX:02 site, you look at our new Footaction site, they are different and they behave differently than each other. We show more hookups and outfits in -- on the Footaction site. You can go to SIX:02 and do intelligent search. So we continue to update and upgrade that. We're looking at how we can bring more of that to the store and connect it to the store. We've added buy online, ship to store, buy online purchase, pick up in store. You can order in a store something that they don't have in their inventory and have it shipped to you. So we've got a whole bunch of things that we're doing to connect the stores and the internet. We are looking at things that we can do to connect even more, and we're going to test something. We're not ready to announce it yet, but we're looking at a new idea that we'll test some time, hopefully, this summer. But there is a significant opportunity to continue to grow and develop the Dot-Com business, and not necessarily at the expense of the store, if we put them together. Because the most used sites on our websites happen to be store connected, store locator, inventory, things like that, and we're going to make sure that we are able to give our associates something so they're better connected. We're using handheld devices and all-in-one devices in the store. So we're using technology as an opportunity. It will grow. What the peak is, as I told everybody, you set a goal of 10%. Now the 10%, by the way, is the banner.com and we're not there yet. We did have a banner past the 10%, but we've got to get all the banners up over it. And as we do here and was alluded to earlier, when we get that goal, we'll set a new one and we'll move beyond. I think there is some limit. What that limit is, is it 20%, is it 30%, is it 40%? I don't know yet. But...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nThe customer will tell us.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Hicks (Executives)】\nThe customer will tell us because we're going to be able to grow both ways. What we want to do is give the customer the product the way they want it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Tracy (Analysts)】\nThat's perfect. And then just real quick for Lauren. As we think about the gross margin next year, leverage on occupancy, but maybe still a little bit maintained on that IMU, as we think about that relative to opportunities to mix up price, and I know there's certain segments of the business that are perhaps dragging on that but we also know Nike, in particular, is starting to test and push some pricing, particularly within basketball, so is there an opportunity there as you think about the pipeline for the year and some opportunities for upside on that IMU if, in fact, you take some pricing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nYes, I think we continue to work with our merchants and try to figure out where the price sensitivity is. There's a lot of categories were there may be a lot bit of upside. But we continue to face some pressures. And I think that -- I don't see it being significantly different in '14 than it was in '13.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nBut that's really why we stay very focused on what are our other opportunities to improve that merchandise margin, and there are other things that we can do. We work internally and very collaborative with our vendors on figuring out how to flow the products better and the allocation system is going to help us make sure that we got it at the right place, right time. All of those things come together to help us do more business at full price, and that gives us some room there on that margin.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Hicks (Executives)】\nYes, we believe and we work closely with our vendors to make sure that we get the best IMU and margin possible. But our focus is not -- we're not like the United Nations. Our focus isn't based upon negotiating with other people. Our focus is on what we can do. We will negotiate with the vendors to try to get as much as we can. And they work with us because they want us to be strong, too. But at the same time, we're going to focus on what we can do. And so that's why the things you hear us talk about, the numbers you hear us talk about, are what we believe we can do.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Seth Sigman (Analysts)】\nIf I could just follow up on the remodel work that you guys have done. It sounds like you're pleased with the improvement in sales that you're seeing in some of these stores. Just trying to dig in a little bit further where that improvement is actually coming from. Do you have a sense of, are you getting better traffic in those locations, maybe some incremental customers, or you're seeing better conversion, more attachments with the apparel assortment? Just trying to get a better picture of what's going on there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nAll of the above. I mean, I think when we remodel a store, that's an excitement to the mall. So we see traffic come up. I think the ability to hook up and show through adjacent product, the footwear and apparel hooks, our accessory hooks, is improved in all of the formats that we're rolling out. And I think that ability to hook up changes our conversion in those stores. So I think that all of those levers work. And I think that the reasons that we've gone through the remodels are to do just that, to increase the flow of traffic, to make the floor more productive, to allow us to convert and hook up with a bigger basket going out the doors.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Hicks (Executives)】\nYes, one of the things that happens in retailers is sometimes you say, \"Well, I want to change the format and do something.\" And normally, in my life, when the retailer does that, it's nice, but you don't see the impact. I give Dick and his team a lot of credit because we're seeing the impact from these remodels. And as we said, we've got criteria. They're meeting and exceeding the criteria. So it's a good thing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Seth Sigman (Analysts)】\nOkay, got it. And it sounds like apparel is a big piece there. Is there any way to quantify the apparel penetration in those stores versus the non-remodeled stores with the company average, something along those lines?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Hicks (Executives)】\nYes, there is, but we don't disclose it. We monitor it very closely. But if you look at the stores, one of the things that stands out more is that we've got a better balance between apparel and footwear.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Seth Sigman (Analysts)】\nOkay, sure. One other driver that you mentioned was the development of a more meaningful team sales and service business. You haven't really talked about that much recently. I mean, where is that business today? What's the opportunity there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Hicks (Executives)】\nWe -- it's a $2 billion business. All the players are pretty small. We had significant growth with the business this past year. We see the opportunity. We're in 11 states, and we're going to continue to build those 11. We're going to continue to slowly add more. We're going to figure out how we can better hook the Eastbay and team sales. So we -- I feel very good about it. This business should be well over $100 million business. And that's what we're working towards. We're professionalizing something that is kind of not very professional out there, but it's a big business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nWanted to just go back to the conversation around the women's business. $1 billion is a big number. If you can just drill down a little bit more on what we should expect from the SIX:02 format as you continue to test that this year, what we think about how to drive growth in Lady Foot Locker long term. And is there any other avenues to reach that target outside of just these 2 formats?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Hicks (Executives)】\nWell, we have 3 elements in our women's business. First is the Lady Foot Locker, which is our biggest direct women's business. And the thing that we know is apparel is a more important part. And we are, through the new Bridgewater format, which is basically a less expensive version of parks, we're able to get a nice pickup with the apparel by putting more apparel in, what the assortment is. And we feel very good about where we are with that. And we will roll that out. We're starting to roll that out this year, and we will have a number of stores that we'll be putting in place. The second part of it is SIX:02. We were pleased with where we are in SIX:02, but we know we still -- there's still some tweaks and improvements. So we're modifying the stores we have. We've got a few more stores we're going to be opening up this year. And we would hope by the end of this year, we'll have a pretty good feel, and that's something that we can move on and roll out. And then the third element are the women's shoes and all of our other banners. And that is a sizable business. And we are better defining what Foot Locker Women's is, what Champs Sports Women's is. And as we do that between our female banners, which are very performance-driven; Foot Locker, which will be more fashion; Champs, which will be a mix of fashion and performance, we'll have a very strong business. And it's a $40 billion plus business at our level. I'm not including the discount level, $40 billion plus business. There's not a player that really has the heart and minds of that woman. We're going to work to do that. And we've got a team, I think, that's dedicated to that and we're pushing on it pretty hard.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nAnd we've got women's opportunities around the globe as well. We sell a lot of women's shoes in Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand. When you think about Runners Point, half of the people that run are women. So again, great assortment opportunities around the globe, as well as in the U.S.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Hicks (Executives)】\nGood call.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nAnd just a quick follow-up, since you're mentioning those other countries, Dick. There's been no conversation about further international expansion. Obviously, I understand you have RPG still hasn't even been a year yet, and you can roll out that format into other countries. But is there any thought process about further global expansion, particularly some of the bigger emerging market countries out there like Brazil and China?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Hicks (Executives)】\nWe constantly look and evaluate and determine where we think we could develop a meaningful and profitable business. I think that talking into people in our business, they would've -- they said the last year, \"Who would have thought our 2 most developing countries are North America and Western Europe?\" Some of the developing countries are having some significant challenges now. And we will evaluate and look and see when the right time is. But right now, we've got tremendous opportunities where we are.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nAnd we insist on things, meeting our hurdle rates no matter where they are in the globe. So we have to be confident if we do that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Taposh Bari (Analysts)】\nI wanted to just kind of dig more into this disparity between running and basketball. I get that the weather was obviously unfavorable for running. But I guess, what percentage of your customer is actually using this product for end use? And I guess, the reason why I'm asking is, there's obviously a very easy excuse for the running business, but is it really all weather? Is there an ASP thing going on there? Is fashion playing a role?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Hicks (Executives)】\nNo, I mean, let's face it, the majority of our shoes are not used for performance. But we had -- there's some been tremendous development between Kobes, KDs, Lebrons, Jordan, that have really helped basketball. We are seeing this spring a plethora of running that will help running. So there's new product. You've got the new BOOST. You've got new Flys coming out. You've got the new shoes from Under Armour. There's a lot of new product coming that I feel will help running. So yes, the weather did have an impact, but it was the newness. There's some fashion. In fact, you look at some of the basketball shoes, they have a tendency to look more like running shoes. But I think that the new ideas -- yes, I'm looking at some shoes here, some KDs that John's wearing, they look like running shoes. But what I think is that this will balance out. And we sell through all of our channels. We sell as many running shoes as anybody else out there. But we've got a stronger position with some great brands, and we will continue to be a leader there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Taposh Bari (Analysts)】\nAnd what about this idea? I know there was that Women's Wear Daily article a couple of weeks ago about white shoes making a comeback. I think, Dick, you're actually quoted in that article. Is that a big deal? Or is that small? And what does it actually mean for your business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nWell, casual, white on white, black on black shoes are -- they're always a base business. They ebb and flow. And when you look at things like Air Force 1s, classic clean K-Swiss shoes, they have their moments. And right now, it feels like we're going into one of those moments. So as Ken talks about the legs on our stool, one of those legs is casual footwear, and certainly, the clean white plays into that casual footwear leg.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bernard Sosnick (Analysts)】\nKen, with regard to the banners and digital, could you go over a little bit of the experience in developing those banners digitally? Because that was a little bit late in coming relative to the digital cycle. How far along are you? You said that you've made a major differentiations among banners. What can we expect over the next few years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Hicks (Executives)】\nWell, first of all, we really didn't get into the digital business, pushed the digital banners until a couple of years ago. We were focused on Eastbay. And Dowe and his team, I think, are doing a much better job balancing that, still pushing Eastbay, but also developing the digital banners when you look at footlocker.com, champssports.com and connecting them with the stores. So we now are much more coordinated in what we do with the stores and dot-com. It used to be if they had the same shoe up, go buy a lottery ticket that day because that was pure luck. Now they're talking constantly. I talked about the connection with buy online, ship to store; buy online, purchase in store; the inventory lookup using our stock locator. So the connection and giving -- I was just down at our team weeks for both the Foot Locker and Champs in the field leadership there and they were talking about how many shoes you have in your inventory and your store. And I'd say, \"Well, I've got extra.\" You've got 250,000 SKUs and I go, wow, because you got that stock locator. And we're seeing much more of that. We've updated a couple of the sites. We have more to update. We will continue to improve and adapt. We will continue to put more technology in the store. So I would say, we are still in the early innings. I feel that we're as far along as anybody else is. We probably don't toot our horn as much as other people. But we are as strong as, I think, anybody is out there in the capability that is meaningful and important to the customer. Thanks, Bernie, and thanks, everybody, for the call.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Maurer (Executives)】\nYes, thank you for participating on the call today, and we look forward to giving you an update on our next call, which is tentatively scheduled for May 3. Thank you very much.",

      "transcript_text1": "Well, the year to January 14 was a great year for NEXT. Earnings per share up 23%, dividend up 23%, and that is the fifth consecutive year that our earnings per share have risen by more than 15%. So something that we're all very proud of. \r\nThere are 2 points that I'd like to bring out of last year's results. The first is about our share price. During the year, it rose by 55%, up to 62.50, and indeed, it's gone higher than that since. That caused us in October, to stop buying our shares back, the first time that we've done that in 10 years. We've replaced it with a special dividend. But it has changed the financial structure of how we return money to shareholders. \r\nThe second point I would like to make is about trading. We had an excellent performance at Christmas, at the top end of our expectation. And what that has done is given us a little more confidence going into this year, and has given us a good base going forward. The guidance that we've given at the end of our report of 4% to 8% is the highest guidance we've given since I've been Chairman of this company, which is now quite a time. So Simon will say more about the guidance and about the share price in his presentation. But we've had a good year and looking forward, we're pretty optimistic. Simon, over to you.\n\n---\n\nHi. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. As Chairman said, we had a good year. Actually, he used the word great, but that was a bit of a wild exuberance, I'll say good. 4 -- 5.5% increase in revenue, 11.2% increase in operating profit. The difference between sales and operating profit is not as great as it appears. Full price sales were up 6.7%, and that's all about less markdown going into the end of season sale. \r\nInterest was level with last year. Looking to the year ahead, we expect interest costs to rise around GBP 30 million, and that's as a result of us having more gross debt. We think that the net debt will remain about the same, but having issued a bond, we got more gross debt. And that increase of GBP 2 million is the difference between having money on deposit and what we're paid by way of interest for the cost of the bond versus what we paid on deposit. \r\nTaxation, we settled a big case with HMRC. That produced a significant provision release. So taxation rate dropped to 20.4%. Obviously, that's a noncash item. And in the year ahead, we expect that to rise to around 21%, which we remain -- which we expect to be the tax rate for the next year and the year after that. \r\nIn terms of profit after tax, 16.9%. Buybacks boosted the earnings further to 23% growth earnings per share. And as we said before, we intend to grow dividends in line -- ordinary dividends in line with earnings per share, so dividends per share up 23% as well. \r\nAnd moving on to the cash flow, CapEx up around GBP 100 million -- I'm sorry, GBP 20 million last year to GBP 105 million. Pretty much all of that change is about increased opening of new stores. We spent a little bit more on refurbishment, but of that GBP 13 million refurbishment costs, GBP 3 million of it was the rebuilding of Warrington that was burned down by our neighbors and rebuilt at our insurers' expense. So really, underlying is GBP 10 million. And GBP 22 million on various pieces of investment around the business. \r\nIn terms of looking at next year, around the same amount on space. Actually, net, we think we'll have a little bit more space next year, I'm going to come onto that. Refurbishment's dropping dramatically. This is really because having opened so much new space over the last 5 or 6 years, there isn't an awful lot of refurbishment to do. So we think around GBP 5 million refurbishment costs in the year ahead. \r\nWarehouse and other, a significant increase here. And I'm just going to spend a little bit of time talking about where we're investing that money in the central heads of the business or central CapEx. Warehouse is GBP 18 million of it, of which GBP 11 million relates to a new Home warehouse and GBP 8 million of that is the land upon which we intend to build the new warehouse. The GBP 5 million of distribution cost is partly the cost of making our next-day to store delivery service universal. At the moment, there's only around 3/4 of the shops get that service, and some of it is infrastructure acquired for our overseas business. \r\nIn terms of systems, a significant investment in systems over the next year, we're rewriting our in-store system and replacing all the hardware. This is mainly because this -- the tills we're using are now obsolete. We can't replace them. And whilst there will be some efficiency gains through rewriting the software, this is really a standstill project rather than a full project. We're rebuilding our IT building to get better facilities for our systems team, and we are renewing a lot of our infrastructure, IT infrastructure to make our systems work better. A lot of that infrastructure is about improving the performance of our website. \r\nAnd then head office, GBP 6 million, of which GBP 2 million is a design studio for our women's clothing and non-clothing designers. And we've also extended and rebuilt some of our Home department.\r\nWorking capital, a very big swing in working capital, and there are 2 things that are driving that, one exception and one not. GBP 50 million of the swing is about increased debt to book in the Directory, GBP 70 million swing is about stock. I'm going to talk about stock, basically. There is an exceptional swing in stock of around GBP 70 million net of increase in creditors. \r\nAnd then ESOT and share buybacks combined, we spent around GBP 30 million more on ESOT share buybacks than we did in the previous year. \r\nIn terms of the balance sheet, fixed assets down 5%. This is all about the difference between depreciation and CapEx. We expect that the difference between depreciation and CapEx to narrow in the year ahead to around GBP 10 million.\r\nStock, as I said -- so when talking about working capital, we've seen a big swing in stock. Perhaps 16% is slightly overstated. As we stand at the moment, we have about 12% more stock in the business. That is really about having less stock last year. So last year, we ran on lower stock for pretty much the whole year. And that's one of the reasons, although not the main reason, where we had lower stock for end of season sale in both winter and summer. \r\nThe stock position on 2 years ago, just to give you a sort of reference point, was -- is around 4% up, just under 4% up. So it's really a return to more normal levels of stock. \r\nDebt is up 12.5%, most of that being driven by Directory debtors. 13% increase in Directory debtors, and that increase was driven by 12% growth in the sales in the last half in credit sales. We look at the half rather than the full year when looking at the debtor book because it's the last half of the year that drives the debt balance at the end of the year, because our consumers pay down their debt roughly over 6 months. The difference between the 12% and the 13% is all about the increased credit limits we gave our best customers.\r\nNet debt, year end, GBP 517 million. Started the year at GBP 493 million. We generated GBP 326 million of operating cash flow. That's after interest, tax and paying ordinary dividends. We spent GBP 26 million maintaining our dividend. So that is really an operational cost. So the true operator -- the real free cash flow is GBP 300 million. Of that, we have -- we -- the GBP 296 million of buybacks. And we increased the cover in the ESOT by around GBP 28 million. That increase is a permanent increase, and it takes the ESOT to around 80%, which is we think where we need to get it in order to be fully covered. So we -- but it also has the effect of reducing earnings per share as long as we don't reduce that percentage going forward.\r\nIncreasing earnings per share -- did I say reduce? Sorry, I meant increasing earnings per share, a very important mistake to make but corrected instantly. \r\nSpecial dividends, we've paid GBP 75 million in special dividend. We've announced the payment of another special dividend beginning of May. And we will either spend another GBP 150 million on further special dividends or buybacks in the year ahead, dependent on where the share price is. \r\nIn terms of the share price, just to remind you, the measure we use to decide whether to do buybacks or special dividends is equivalent rate of return. This is the return required from an alternative investment if that investment were to produce the same earnings enhancement as the proposed buyback. So it's basically saying, if we were to invest this money in the business, what you would have to do to give in order -- how much we'll have to grow profits by to get an 8% increase in profits.\r\nWe spent a long time talking to many shareholders about this. The 8% figure, you can argue about some people. On the whole, more people said it's too high than too low, but by no means universal. The 8%, most people agreed with. At GBP 695 million of profit before tax, at 8%, that gives a share price of around GBP 58, almost exactly GBP 58. \r\nWhat many people have said to us, and we agree with this, is that we -- in the same way that you look at dividend yield going forward, we should be looking at earnings per -- equivalent rate of return going forward. So we're going to use the midpoint of our guidance, of our publicly issued guidance, at any point in time to determine the maximum share price that we would pay. That takes the maximum share price to around GBP 62.45, still quite a long way from where the share price is today. And it goes back to the old adage that if you're going to move the goal post, make sure the ball has gone the other end of the field first.\r\nThat was a little joke there just to liven up the morning, but clearly, it hasn't had that effect. But we'll try later for some more wit and humor.\r\nMoving on to the retail accounts. Against our expectations, retail total moved forward and profits moved forward. Again, the sales hit somewhat distorted. The 1.7% is total sales. Full price sales were up 3%, markdown sales down 11%. Sales from new space, we've got a 3.1% growth from new space of an average net space increase, in percentage terms, around 4.2%. That has given us a 72% return on the space that we've opened. That's an unusual figure. We would normally budget between 60% and 65%. That has been the consistent figure for the last 8 or 9 years.\r\nThe reason that this one has been higher than usual is all about 2 stores that we opened with that were big space and high-density, one of which was Camberley, the other one is -- was in Sprucefield, Lisburn.\r\nProfit analysis. Operating profit up 5%, significantly ahead of sales. All and more of that profit increase was driven by reduced markdown. So I think there is a risk and indeed, at the last meeting that we had, there was some confusion of what that 0.8% improvement means. It doesn't mean that we reduced our markdowns by 0.8% and reduced discounting by that amount or improved clearance rates by that amount. Of that 0.8%, 0.6% of it is all about the mix between full price and markdown profit. So the 0.6% comes from growth in full price sales, not reduction in markdown.\r\n0.2% of it does come from improved clearance rates, and that's because whilst our sales were down 11%, our stock was down 15%. So we cleared through better. And that gave us a 0.2% improvement. We expect that 0.2% improvement to reverse out in the year ahead because we went in with exceptionally low stock levels.\r\nFreight, fabric and stock loss, all sort of pretty much in equal measure, contributed another 0.5% towards achieved gross margin. Store payroll, a very slight positive here, 2 things going on. Cost of living would've cost around minus 0.2% of margin, but the efficiency measures we put in improved productive clawed slightly more than that back to get a net figure of 0.1 up. \r\nStore occupancy, adverse movement to 0.7%. Of this 0.7%, 0.3% of it relates to write-offs that won't recur in the current year. 0.4 of it is about rent and rates, and those 2 pretty much in equal measure. The rental figure, most of that 0.2% is driven by like-for-like declines in certain stores. And the actual rent reviews we're seeing coming through, the vast majority of those are at mill at the moment. And on non-renewal, we're seeing the majority of leases, if we renew a lease, we're seeing the rent coming down.\r\nAnd other overheads, really central overheads and staff incentives. \r\nMoving on to Directory. Directory had a cracking year. Full price sale is up 14%, markdown flat. In terms of the contribution to that growth, 8.5% of the 12.4 came from U.K. business, which grew around 9%. International added another 3.9% to the growth to get to the 12.4%. \r\nIn terms of customer base, we now have a customer base of 3.7 million. And customers, we define active customers as those who have bought something within the last 4 or 5 months, 20 weeks actually, the last 20 weeks, or have paid off part of their balance in the last 20 weeks. \r\nIn terms of where that growth came from, in the U.K, we recruited more cash customers than credit customers, although the contribution to sale -- to sales growth wasn't as great. Because on the whole, the credit customers tend to spend more. And we increased our number of overseas customers by around 120,000.\r\nIn terms of profit, big move forward in the operating profit of Directory, much bigger than sales. Again, there's a markdown effect here, but a much more significant markdown effect than we saw in retail. Of that 1.8% improvement in markdown, 0.7 of it is about mix. That has just -- come from growth in full price sales. 1.1% of it has come from improved clearance rates. And of that 1.1%, 0.8% of it came from improved clearance rates in the end of season sales. And that's because our stock was down 9%, but our sales were flat. I don't think we will lose all of that 0.9%, whereas the 0.2 in retail, I think we will lose. I don't think we'll lose all the 0.9% in retail because some of it has come as a result of more efficient clearance processes in the Directory. The other 0.3% was about last year's stock that we had anticipated we wouldn't sell, but we actually managed to sell online.\r\nFreight, fabric and stock loss 0.2 here. That compares to 0.5 in retail. The difference was this time last year, we had a provision release on this line of 0.3. So actually, underlying 0.5 both in retail and Directory improvement in margin as a result of freight, fabric and stock loss improvements.\r\nCatalog production, 0.2% improvement here. Two things going on. First of all, a positive movement of 0.6%, and this is because cash customers don't require catalogs, don't tend to request catalogs, and that means we printed fewer catalogs. That gave us a 0.6% improvement. We -- but at the same time, we introduced more brochures, in particular, new in brochures that go mid season, and those ate up 0.4% of that gain. \r\nWarehouse and distribution. The adverse movement of 0.5% mainly relating to, in fact, more than all of it, relates to the costs of international dispatchers. That's right, it's more expensive to deliver overseas, so this line gets particularly hit by international. The cost of that actually would have been 0.7%. We offset some of that with cost savings on U.K. distribution.\r\nService charge and bad debt, 0.5% adverse movement as a result of credit sales growing slower than total sales, and a 0.1% improvement as a result of slightly lower bad debt. \r\nCentral overheads, 0.1%.\r\nMoving off the accounts onto the more general part of the presentation. This is slightly more interesting, this bit. So you can even stop your e-mailing, and if you look up and enjoy this part, because this is more interesting, I promise you. \r\nSo 5 things that we're going to focus on. These things won't come as a surprise because 4 of them were here last year and the year before. Develop the NEXT brand, that really means improving our product; grow retail space; develop our business online; improve service, which is an additional objective for the business, which I'm going to talk about in a little bit more detail later on; and control costs. \r\nIn terms of our financial objective, traditionally, we've said it's to deliver long-term sustainable growth in earnings per share. Having switched from buybacks to special dividends, that objective isn't quite right. And our new objective fulfills all the functions of the previous objective, but it is more appropriate to what we're doing. So long-term, sustainable growth in total shareholder returns. This is different from TSR, as you know, which is share price positive within growth. What we're looking at here is growth in earnings per share plus dividend yield. And that is done in the belief that long-term, growth in earnings per share does eventually filter through into share price. \r\nI'm going to focus on 4 of those things in the presentation. Starting with retail space. That's now our quite old shop in Ipswich. We opened 11 new stores. We moved 8, we extended 13, closed 10. So net increase in stores of just 1:541. Total increase in space of 280,000. \r\nWhat you will have noticed is that an area that we haven't been particularly good at forecasting is our space pipeline. So -- and what's happened is we've consistently overestimated the amount of space that we will open. So for the year that we're currently in, a year ago, we were talking about 450,000 square feet. We're now talking about 360,000 square feet. That's not because we don't plan to open space, it's because it's taking much, much longer to open the much bigger stores than we had anticipated. Part of that is about simple build time, but by far, the most important factor in that is the planning and the deal side of it. And mainly, it's about planning. And the planners' motto seems to be that they won't say no, they'll just say yes very, very slowly. \r\nIn terms of the space that we have opened, in the year just gone, 40% of it was in Home departments. That's not all in standalone or big Home shops. Part of that is in fashion stores in town. So we're now at a situation where 25% of our space across the group is given over to Home. And in retail, that equates to around 16% of the sales. And that compares to around 18% of our sales across the group on Home across the brand. \r\nIn terms of the performance of the new space, pretty much as we expected, around 4% up both in terms of fashion and large format Homes. Return on capital comfortably below our 24-month payback. Profitability, pretty much 22%, and that compares to our rest of store profit of around 23%. That comparison of the 22% to the 23% is actually better than it looks because a lot of the -- some of the 23% will be in stores where their assets have already been written down and depreciation is very low. \r\nIn terms of the pipeline moving forward, this is our new shop that we're building bottom up in Hedge End, that's what we hope it will look like when it opens in August. Pipeline remains at GBP 1.1 million. But again, as I mentioned earlier, it has slipped back a little bit. 360,000, we intend -- we anticipate will open in the current year; 400,000 next year; 350,000 year after. In terms of what that space is made up of, 40% of it comes from the new large-format, side-by-side stores with a separate Home entrance and Home on 2 floors: the downstairs furnishing downstairs, the upstairs furnishing upstairs. We're opening 3 of those stores in the current year, and they will account for around 30% of the current year's openings. Just little pictures of them, York, Hedge End and Maidstone. Two of those we have designed the building, as well as the internals of the shop. And our aim here is to slowly but surely transform the nature of what out-of-town shopping means to the NEXT customer. \r\nI think -- I do think this is really important going forward, and not just for NEXT, but for the whole of retail. I think it's going to be important that we create -- that where we open out-of-town, we don't throw up big, ugly sheds because people won't be enthusiastic about it. But when you throw out something that is actually nice to look and nice to be in, people are much less antipathetic to it, particularly if it's got a nice cafe in it, which this one has on the mezzanine on the right-hand side. You can sit there and look at the roundabout and flyover, get a beautiful view of it. \r\nJust to remind you how our shop fit has changed over the last 7 years -- 8 years, this is what our new shop would have looked like in 2006. And the cost of that was GBP 127 a square foot. If you adjust that for inflation, in today's money, that would be GBP 149 a square foot. This is our latest womenswear shop fit in Romford. This is the shoe department. You can see it's got concrete walls, parquet flooring, a light well that we bought in through the stockroom to get some natural light into the back of the shop. And real marble tops on the shoe department -- on the shoe fixtures. \r\nThe interesting thing about this shop is that when you look at the cost of it, actually, in real terms, it's slightly cheaper than the shops we were building in 2006. And there are all sorts of reason for that, part -- building costs have come down, globalization on building materials, this meant that there are things that we can get cheaper. But the point we would make about this is that actually, the real investment hasn't been in the materials that we've put into the shop. It has been in the design work that's gone into finding the mosaic, and then buying it in enough bulk and in pieces that you can assemble it so that it is affordable.\r\nAnd within the business, we've used this. And I'm going to show you a couple -- I'm going to talk a bit about product now, which is always dangerous for a Chief Executive because you can sound a bit insincere and scripted when you [indiscernible] retail company talks about products. What I'm going to show you are some of the slides we presented to our staff to give you a flavor of what we're trying to achieve on product, which is really what comes down to the same thing, comes down to getting fantastic fabrics, great detailing on design. We design pretty much all of our products in-house, sourcing the trim ourselves and hand -- all the prints we produce, pretty much all of them are in-house prints as well. And it's a question of designing those beautifully, getting them right, and then buying them in enough volume to get them at affordable prices. And that is kind of the essence of what we're trying to achieve in our product departments. \r\nBut one thing we'll be very clear about, and I share it with you just in case you think we get all NEXT products, are they going to have bells and whistles on it, great design doesn't mean overdesign. So a great design can be simple. And great design doesn't mean just focusing on the top end of your price architecture. The basics must be well-designed, whether that be the slab fabric that we're using or the shape of the neckline on a T-shirt. Everything should be designed correctly. And that is the aim of what we're trying to achieve in our product departments at the moment. \r\nWhat we've also done is changed our buying cycle to make sure that our stock is more appropriate to the time of year and that our customers are buying it.\r\nTraditional retail buying cycles have worked on our spring, summer and autumn, winter collections. You'll see in the shops, the spring-summer range has just arrived. And there is a problem with that, in that when you sit down and do a spring-summer design work presentation, inevitably, you're thinking of summer rather than spring. And what's -- this just shows the performance of our womenswear clothing division in Phase 1 and 2 of spring-summer compared to 3, 4 and 5 of spring-summer, and autumn-winter 1 and 2 compared to 3 and 4 autumn-winter. \r\nNow there were other things that affected this performance. So it's not as dramatic as it appears on the screen in terms of the seasonal effect. What you can see is that underlying that, there is definitely an effect where we are designing our ranges in a way that isn't appropriate for spring or autumn. And there, at the bottom there, you can see a generic designer of no particular sex there. It's just a sort of a designer. When they're thinking of spring-summer, they're thinking of beaches. When they're thinking autumn-winter, they're thinking of Winter Wonderland. \r\nGoing forward, we're going to be more paired with the temperature. Because if you look at the last 10 years, what's interesting is that autumn is warmer than summer and spring is colder than winter. So going forward, we are buying 4 in 4 seasons, 4 design presentations for spring, summer, autumn, winter. Partly that means our stock will be more appropriate, although I should point out that this is not an absolute shift. \r\nPeople still -- if something's really fashionable and they really like it, they will buy summer dresses in early spring. So there will be a summer element to our spring ranges. But there's going to be more to buy that is appropriate to the time of year. What the customers will also see, more importantly, is a much bigger change going from spring into summer and from autumn into winter. And I think in the very long term, what you'll see is that our mid season sales accordingly increase in size, and our end of season sales reduce in size. It's not an effect that's going to take place immediately. We think over the next 10 years, we'll slowly see mid season sale increase in expense of the end of season sale.\r\nService is an area that we haven't focused on over the last 5 -- because I haven't talked to you about it over the last 5 years. It's not that we think we've -- it's not that we've been sleeping. It's that it hasn't been top of our list. And when you look -- if you look at where we sit -- this is an independent ranking of various retailers. I haven't named them to save any embarrassment for anybody. I haven't named the other retailers, but this is the main retailers you can think of on the high street. This is the percentage that rated outstanding, very good and good. And you can see we're about in the middle of the pack and not a long way behind #3, 4 and 5. \r\nHowever, if you look at the customers who rate NEXT outstanding and very good, the difference drops dramatically. And it's that -- it's moving from good to very good and outstanding that we are -- we aim to achieve over the next few years, both in our retail stores and as importantly, and in some ways more importantly, in terms of how we handle people in our call center.\r\nI mean, just -- I'm going to share with you a few of the things that we -- a few of the operational things that we've done to improve service. We changed our recruitment process. And the watch word here is to recruit for attitude, not skill. So in the past, we've fallen into the trap of, say, have you got retail experience? When did you last work in a shop? And actually, it only takes half an hour to an hour to train someone on retail. It's not -- it's a job where it's far more important to us that they come and that they're nice people, that they're team players, that they work hard, that they're enthusiastic, that they turn up on time, that they get on with their colleagues, and that they genuinely want to do -- give a good service to their customers. \r\nWe've been -- we sort of torn up our appraisal system, which is -- the appraisal systems that doubtless, you will be used to in the bank, and such great big tomes of paper that have no meaning whatsoever, but produce annual grind for people to sit through. We've changed that and done a TripAdvisor, very quick, 15-minute, half-an-hour appraisal, which we do 4 times a year, very simple rating system, 4 stars for excellent, 1 star for needs to improve or you're in trouble.\r\nWe've then taken that through into the way that we allocate extra hours. So in retail business, our peaks, we always have extra hours. When people go on holidays, we have extra hours. And in the past, that process of giving out extra hours has been done by the store manager asking people to go on extra hours. We've -- what we've done is we've developed a system whereby the staff can go on to sign in online or on their mobiles, 70% of them are doing this on their mobiles, and see what shifts are available on the different days of the week. They can then see what shifts -- what time of day their shifts are and how much they will earn. \r\nBecause we know it's them that's logged in, we know what their pay rate is, over 21, under 21, merit sales or normal sales consultant. So we can give them the actual amount of money that they will earn. They just click on it, accept it and that's it, they're in to work. What they can also do is give up time on there. So they can swap their shifts and offer them up. So if people want, for any reason, need time off, they can offer them on the marketplace. It's not guaranteed to go, but at the moment, we are getting around 80% of the shifts that we put on the marketplace are being taken up. \r\nAnd the nice thing about this is that it works with our appraisal system. And what we do is we give the 4-star rated people an extra day to look at those shifts. So they get a whole day to take those shifts before anyone else gets a look at them, then the 3 stars, then the 2 stars, and the 1 stars don't get a look at them.\r\nIn terms of online, I'm not going -- we've done a lot with next-day delivery to store, which you know about, so I'm not going to talk about that. I'm going to talk about international. International had a really good year. GBP 33 million 2 years ago, GBP 54 million last year. In the year just gone, GBP 101 million. Two things to point out about this. It was much -- this was much greater growth than we were expecting at the beginning of the year. We said GBP 70 million to GBP 75 million. The other thing to note is the slight decline in margin. This was something that we managed. We did 2 things. First, we saved a lot of money on distribution and operations and overseas in certain territories. And we passed a little bit more than that back to our customers overseas by way of permanent price reduction. So this wasn't promotion. This is just saying everything now on this website is now 10% cheaper.\r\nAnd it -- it was those price reductions more than anything else that has -- that drove the exceptional level of growth. We managed to achieve price reductions in 28 territories, which, between them, account for around 50% of our overseas territories. We also converted 5 territories that were trading in dollars or euros to their domestic currency and introduced one new translation, which was Chinese -- traditional Chinese for Taiwan. \r\nLooking forward to the year ahead, we're expecting around GBP 150 million growth. The reason that the growth is less aggressive than the year just gone is because we got far fewer price reductions. And when those price reductions annualize, it will be extraordinary if we didn't see a falloff in the growth rate. \r\nLooking to the -- we're not [indiscernible] looking to the year ahead, we've got 11 new territories we want to open. We're converting 11 countries to their domestic currency. That does have a positive impact in sales in our experience, but nothing like the effect of lowering prices. We've got 6 new languages that we're introducing on various sites across the globe and only 5 price reductions that account for just under 2% of the sales of our online business. \r\nIncidentally, one of the countries here that we're opening is China. This is the second time in 2 years that I've announced the opening of our Chinese website. And -- but this -- it's actually working at the moment. We've got it in test mode, so we are actually delivering stock to China. And you can't get to it yet, but that will come public in the next few days. Please don't expect too much from China. I think there's an enormous temptation to think that China is -- because there are 2 billion people, there'll be enormous number of sales. That is not our expectation. The vast majority of our customers, we don't think this -- our product will be appropriate for in China. So we're not too excited about that.\r\nIn terms of the outlook, a brief word about the economy. We are more positive about the economy than we've been for the last 6 years. Employment is looking good. Housing transactions are increasing, in line with growth in mortgage approvals. And this is definitely having an impact on our Home business, which has been our fastest-growing significant area in the last year. And that's -- and the space that we bought over the last 6 years -- we've pretty much doubled our Home space over the last 6 years. That is now beginning to really pay dividends.\r\nThe one thing about this that's interesting is although transaction levels are growing by 20% on last year, they're still 20% below the sort of run rate that the U.K. were seeing in the '90s. So we're not necessarily expecting the turnover of housing to drop in the next year. So we think that this is a permanent return to normality rather than an aberration. But we could be wrong about that.\r\nIn terms of credit flow, totals of GBP 7 billion, this is the Bank of England, flows of credit. This doesn't include write-offs or backers. This is real cash in and out of the economy. Significant change in 2013 compared to the previous 3 years. In total, GBP 7 billion of debt flowed into the economy. That's around 1% of total earnings in the U.K., total earned income excluding pensions. So it kind of makes up for the gap between -- and one way of looking at that is it kind of makes up for the fall in real earnings over the last year, which is one of the reasons I think last year was slightly better than we were expecting. \r\nBut obviously, that cannot continue forever. You can't have credit growing faster than earnings forever. And on the earnings front, for the first time, we've seen what might be some positive news on this. And the numbers out yesterday just showed that inflation and earnings almost touching -- still negative, almost touching. So I think we're at a turning point. It's very difficult to know which way it's going to go. There might be a blip, there might not be. But if it's not a blip and we see return to growth in real earnings, then I think that is good news for the retail economy. \r\nSo on balance, we think that things are looking slightly rosier in the economy. But there are risks. If we don't see growth in earnings, there is a question as to the sustainability of credit growth. We've all been there before. There's a real risk that the housing bubble in the southeast of the country will suck a lot of money out of the economy and encourage people to take on too much debt, and that will be not necessarily damaging in the short term, but in the medium to long term. When the interest rates go up, it will be very damaging. So although we're positive, we recognize that any real strong positive movement in the economy will result in an interest rate rise. And again, that will be a significant impact. \r\nThere's also GBP 1.2 trillion, GBP 1.3 trillion worth of mortgage debt. 1% on that is 2% of earnings in very simple terms. It doesn't all come through straight away, some people are on fixed mortgages, some people are below the minimum. But I don't think that it will be right to prepare for a return to the boom days because as soon as it looks like there will be a boom, the interest rate breaks will be applied and you shouldn't underestimate both the science of those interest rate breaks and the shock that people will get when they go up. Because although -- sort of it's a bit like death. Everyone knows that it will happen, but no one quite believes it. So it's a nice little analogy there for you, so to get the points across. \r\nBut I think that it will come as a significant shock to the U.K. consumer when interest rates go up. So we need to be cautious in our outlook, but we are slightly more optimistic. And for that reason, we have set our sales range between 4% and 8% maximum. That's the -- as the Chairman very gladly said vested, the highest sales range we've given since he was Chairman. We haven't been giving sales ranges for that long, for as long as he's been Chairman, I should just point out. But it is nonetheless quite an aggressive number for us. It compares to 5.5% last year. And you might think, oh, well, that's sort of typical NEXT, overly conservative. \r\nI would just remind you that if you look across the year, that 5.5% was hugely driven by the last quarter. And not only do we not expect the last quarter to be as strong in the year ahead. Because it was so strong, it will give us very tough comparatives. And our own budgets for the fourth quarter are extremely conservative because we know that some of the business that we won then, we are likely to lose. So if you look at the first 3 quarters, the run rate was 3%. And in that context, the 4% to 8% looks reasonable, if not aggressive.\r\nIn terms of what that means for profit, 4% to 8% profit range means we're still anticipating lower negative like-for-likes, GBP 12 million cost of negative like-for-likes, GBP 44 million of cost increases. The vast majority of that relates to wage inflation and occupancy cost increases. That will get you to over GBP 30 million of that cost. Still significant cost savings coming through in the business in Directory operations, still some savings to come through in retail operations and some balancing savings also in our occupancy costs where we've taken write-offs last year that we don't expect to recur in the year ahead, which all of you will spot on real savings and not cash, obviously. So slightly deceptive, this one. New space, we think, will give us GBP 15 million and Directory growth will give us GBP 49 million. So cost savings in Directory in equal measure, providing the lion's share of the growth for next year, midpoint of GBP 750 million. \r\nThat was -- so that gives a profit range of 5% to 11%. A dividend yield of 2%, and that's based on the share price around GBP 65. Special dividend yield of around 3%, assuming that special dividends continue. If they don't, that 3% will just convert into earnings enhancement by way of buybacks. So underlying total shareholder returns of EPS growth plus dividend yield, we're looking at somewhere between 10% and 16% in the year ahead, which we think is a reasonable ambition. \r\nJust in terms of where that sits, you'll remember, I showed you this graph 5 years ago of our ambitions for earnings enhancement, profit growth and dividend yield. We achieved 25% in the year just gone. That figure is a bit of a cheat because 5% of it came from tax. So underlying growth total return is around 20%. In the year ahead, we're looking at 10% to 16%. So still comfortably within our target range of 9% to 15% that we set the business 6 years ago.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: R. Barton (Executives)】\nWell, the year to January 14 was a great year for NEXT. Earnings per share up 23%, dividend up 23%, and that is the fifth consecutive year that our earnings per share have risen by more than 15%. So something that we're all very proud of. \r\nThere are 2 points that I'd like to bring out of last year's results. The first is about our share price. During the year, it rose by 55%, up to 62.50, and indeed, it's gone higher than that since. That caused us in October, to stop buying our shares back, the first time that we've done that in 10 years. We've replaced it with a special dividend. But it has changed the financial structure of how we return money to shareholders. \r\nThe second point I would like to make is about trading. We had an excellent performance at Christmas, at the top end of our expectation. And what that has done is given us a little more confidence going into this year, and has given us a good base going forward. The guidance that we've given at the end of our report of 4% to 8% is the highest guidance we've given since I've been Chairman of this company, which is now quite a time. So Simon will say more about the guidance and about the share price in his presentation. But we've had a good year and looking forward, we're pretty optimistic. Simon, over to you.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Simon Wolfson (Executives)】\nHi. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. As Chairman said, we had a good year. Actually, he used the word great, but that was a bit of a wild exuberance, I'll say good. 4 -- 5.5% increase in revenue, 11.2% increase in operating profit. The difference between sales and operating profit is not as great as it appears. Full price sales were up 6.7%, and that's all about less markdown going into the end of season sale. \r\nInterest was level with last year. Looking to the year ahead, we expect interest costs to rise around GBP 30 million, and that's as a result of us having more gross debt. We think that the net debt will remain about the same, but having issued a bond, we got more gross debt. And that increase of GBP 2 million is the difference between having money on deposit and what we're paid by way of interest for the cost of the bond versus what we paid on deposit. \r\nTaxation, we settled a big case with HMRC. That produced a significant provision release. So taxation rate dropped to 20.4%. Obviously, that's a noncash item. And in the year ahead, we expect that to rise to around 21%, which we remain -- which we expect to be the tax rate for the next year and the year after that. \r\nIn terms of profit after tax, 16.9%. Buybacks boosted the earnings further to 23% growth earnings per share. And as we said before, we intend to grow dividends in line -- ordinary dividends in line with earnings per share, so dividends per share up 23% as well. \r\nAnd moving on to the cash flow, CapEx up around GBP 100 million -- I'm sorry, GBP 20 million last year to GBP 105 million. Pretty much all of that change is about increased opening of new stores. We spent a little bit more on refurbishment, but of that GBP 13 million refurbishment costs, GBP 3 million of it was the rebuilding of Warrington that was burned down by our neighbors and rebuilt at our insurers' expense. So really, underlying is GBP 10 million. And GBP 22 million on various pieces of investment around the business. \r\nIn terms of looking at next year, around the same amount on space. Actually, net, we think we'll have a little bit more space next year, I'm going to come onto that. Refurbishment's dropping dramatically. This is really because having opened so much new space over the last 5 or 6 years, there isn't an awful lot of refurbishment to do. So we think around GBP 5 million refurbishment costs in the year ahead. \r\nWarehouse and other, a significant increase here. And I'm just going to spend a little bit of time talking about where we're investing that money in the central heads of the business or central CapEx. Warehouse is GBP 18 million of it, of which GBP 11 million relates to a new Home warehouse and GBP 8 million of that is the land upon which we intend to build the new warehouse. The GBP 5 million of distribution cost is partly the cost of making our next-day to store delivery service universal. At the moment, there's only around 3/4 of the shops get that service, and some of it is infrastructure acquired for our overseas business. \r\nIn terms of systems, a significant investment in systems over the next year, we're rewriting our in-store system and replacing all the hardware. This is mainly because this -- the tills we're using are now obsolete. We can't replace them. And whilst there will be some efficiency gains through rewriting the software, this is really a standstill project rather than a full project. We're rebuilding our IT building to get better facilities for our systems team, and we are renewing a lot of our infrastructure, IT infrastructure to make our systems work better. A lot of that infrastructure is about improving the performance of our website. \r\nAnd then head office, GBP 6 million, of which GBP 2 million is a design studio for our women's clothing and non-clothing designers. And we've also extended and rebuilt some of our Home department.\r\nWorking capital, a very big swing in working capital, and there are 2 things that are driving that, one exception and one not. GBP 50 million of the swing is about increased debt to book in the Directory, GBP 70 million swing is about stock. I'm going to talk about stock, basically. There is an exceptional swing in stock of around GBP 70 million net of increase in creditors. \r\nAnd then ESOT and share buybacks combined, we spent around GBP 30 million more on ESOT share buybacks than we did in the previous year. \r\nIn terms of the balance sheet, fixed assets down 5%. This is all about the difference between depreciation and CapEx. We expect that the difference between depreciation and CapEx to narrow in the year ahead to around GBP 10 million.\r\nStock, as I said -- so when talking about working capital, we've seen a big swing in stock. Perhaps 16% is slightly overstated. As we stand at the moment, we have about 12% more stock in the business. That is really about having less stock last year. So last year, we ran on lower stock for pretty much the whole year. And that's one of the reasons, although not the main reason, where we had lower stock for end of season sale in both winter and summer. \r\nThe stock position on 2 years ago, just to give you a sort of reference point, was -- is around 4% up, just under 4% up. So it's really a return to more normal levels of stock. \r\nDebt is up 12.5%, most of that being driven by Directory debtors. 13% increase in Directory debtors, and that increase was driven by 12% growth in the sales in the last half in credit sales. We look at the half rather than the full year when looking at the debtor book because it's the last half of the year that drives the debt balance at the end of the year, because our consumers pay down their debt roughly over 6 months. The difference between the 12% and the 13% is all about the increased credit limits we gave our best customers.\r\nNet debt, year end, GBP 517 million. Started the year at GBP 493 million. We generated GBP 326 million of operating cash flow. That's after interest, tax and paying ordinary dividends. We spent GBP 26 million maintaining our dividend. So that is really an operational cost. So the true operator -- the real free cash flow is GBP 300 million. Of that, we have -- we -- the GBP 296 million of buybacks. And we increased the cover in the ESOT by around GBP 28 million. That increase is a permanent increase, and it takes the ESOT to around 80%, which is we think where we need to get it in order to be fully covered. So we -- but it also has the effect of reducing earnings per share as long as we don't reduce that percentage going forward.\r\nIncreasing earnings per share -- did I say reduce? Sorry, I meant increasing earnings per share, a very important mistake to make but corrected instantly. \r\nSpecial dividends, we've paid GBP 75 million in special dividend. We've announced the payment of another special dividend beginning of May. And we will either spend another GBP 150 million on further special dividends or buybacks in the year ahead, dependent on where the share price is. \r\nIn terms of the share price, just to remind you, the measure we use to decide whether to do buybacks or special dividends is equivalent rate of return. This is the return required from an alternative investment if that investment were to produce the same earnings enhancement as the proposed buyback. So it's basically saying, if we were to invest this money in the business, what you would have to do to give in order -- how much we'll have to grow profits by to get an 8% increase in profits.\r\nWe spent a long time talking to many shareholders about this. The 8% figure, you can argue about some people. On the whole, more people said it's too high than too low, but by no means universal. The 8%, most people agreed with. At GBP 695 million of profit before tax, at 8%, that gives a share price of around GBP 58, almost exactly GBP 58. \r\nWhat many people have said to us, and we agree with this, is that we -- in the same way that you look at dividend yield going forward, we should be looking at earnings per -- equivalent rate of return going forward. So we're going to use the midpoint of our guidance, of our publicly issued guidance, at any point in time to determine the maximum share price that we would pay. That takes the maximum share price to around GBP 62.45, still quite a long way from where the share price is today. And it goes back to the old adage that if you're going to move the goal post, make sure the ball has gone the other end of the field first.\r\nThat was a little joke there just to liven up the morning, but clearly, it hasn't had that effect. But we'll try later for some more wit and humor.\r\nMoving on to the retail accounts. Against our expectations, retail total moved forward and profits moved forward. Again, the sales hit somewhat distorted. The 1.7% is total sales. Full price sales were up 3%, markdown sales down 11%. Sales from new space, we've got a 3.1% growth from new space of an average net space increase, in percentage terms, around 4.2%. That has given us a 72% return on the space that we've opened. That's an unusual figure. We would normally budget between 60% and 65%. That has been the consistent figure for the last 8 or 9 years.\r\nThe reason that this one has been higher than usual is all about 2 stores that we opened with that were big space and high-density, one of which was Camberley, the other one is -- was in Sprucefield, Lisburn.\r\nProfit analysis. Operating profit up 5%, significantly ahead of sales. All and more of that profit increase was driven by reduced markdown. So I think there is a risk and indeed, at the last meeting that we had, there was some confusion of what that 0.8% improvement means. It doesn't mean that we reduced our markdowns by 0.8% and reduced discounting by that amount or improved clearance rates by that amount. Of that 0.8%, 0.6% of it is all about the mix between full price and markdown profit. So the 0.6% comes from growth in full price sales, not reduction in markdown.\r\n0.2% of it does come from improved clearance rates, and that's because whilst our sales were down 11%, our stock was down 15%. So we cleared through better. And that gave us a 0.2% improvement. We expect that 0.2% improvement to reverse out in the year ahead because we went in with exceptionally low stock levels.\r\nFreight, fabric and stock loss, all sort of pretty much in equal measure, contributed another 0.5% towards achieved gross margin. Store payroll, a very slight positive here, 2 things going on. Cost of living would've cost around minus 0.2% of margin, but the efficiency measures we put in improved productive clawed slightly more than that back to get a net figure of 0.1 up. \r\nStore occupancy, adverse movement to 0.7%. Of this 0.7%, 0.3% of it relates to write-offs that won't recur in the current year. 0.4 of it is about rent and rates, and those 2 pretty much in equal measure. The rental figure, most of that 0.2% is driven by like-for-like declines in certain stores. And the actual rent reviews we're seeing coming through, the vast majority of those are at mill at the moment. And on non-renewal, we're seeing the majority of leases, if we renew a lease, we're seeing the rent coming down.\r\nAnd other overheads, really central overheads and staff incentives. \r\nMoving on to Directory. Directory had a cracking year. Full price sale is up 14%, markdown flat. In terms of the contribution to that growth, 8.5% of the 12.4 came from U.K. business, which grew around 9%. International added another 3.9% to the growth to get to the 12.4%. \r\nIn terms of customer base, we now have a customer base of 3.7 million. And customers, we define active customers as those who have bought something within the last 4 or 5 months, 20 weeks actually, the last 20 weeks, or have paid off part of their balance in the last 20 weeks. \r\nIn terms of where that growth came from, in the U.K, we recruited more cash customers than credit customers, although the contribution to sale -- to sales growth wasn't as great. Because on the whole, the credit customers tend to spend more. And we increased our number of overseas customers by around 120,000.\r\nIn terms of profit, big move forward in the operating profit of Directory, much bigger than sales. Again, there's a markdown effect here, but a much more significant markdown effect than we saw in retail. Of that 1.8% improvement in markdown, 0.7 of it is about mix. That has just -- come from growth in full price sales. 1.1% of it has come from improved clearance rates. And of that 1.1%, 0.8% of it came from improved clearance rates in the end of season sales. And that's because our stock was down 9%, but our sales were flat. I don't think we will lose all of that 0.9%, whereas the 0.2 in retail, I think we will lose. I don't think we'll lose all the 0.9% in retail because some of it has come as a result of more efficient clearance processes in the Directory. The other 0.3% was about last year's stock that we had anticipated we wouldn't sell, but we actually managed to sell online.\r\nFreight, fabric and stock loss 0.2 here. That compares to 0.5 in retail. The difference was this time last year, we had a provision release on this line of 0.3. So actually, underlying 0.5 both in retail and Directory improvement in margin as a result of freight, fabric and stock loss improvements.\r\nCatalog production, 0.2% improvement here. Two things going on. First of all, a positive movement of 0.6%, and this is because cash customers don't require catalogs, don't tend to request catalogs, and that means we printed fewer catalogs. That gave us a 0.6% improvement. We -- but at the same time, we introduced more brochures, in particular, new in brochures that go mid season, and those ate up 0.4% of that gain. \r\nWarehouse and distribution. The adverse movement of 0.5% mainly relating to, in fact, more than all of it, relates to the costs of international dispatchers. That's right, it's more expensive to deliver overseas, so this line gets particularly hit by international. The cost of that actually would have been 0.7%. We offset some of that with cost savings on U.K. distribution.\r\nService charge and bad debt, 0.5% adverse movement as a result of credit sales growing slower than total sales, and a 0.1% improvement as a result of slightly lower bad debt. \r\nCentral overheads, 0.1%.\r\nMoving off the accounts onto the more general part of the presentation. This is slightly more interesting, this bit. So you can even stop your e-mailing, and if you look up and enjoy this part, because this is more interesting, I promise you. \r\nSo 5 things that we're going to focus on. These things won't come as a surprise because 4 of them were here last year and the year before. Develop the NEXT brand, that really means improving our product; grow retail space; develop our business online; improve service, which is an additional objective for the business, which I'm going to talk about in a little bit more detail later on; and control costs. \r\nIn terms of our financial objective, traditionally, we've said it's to deliver long-term sustainable growth in earnings per share. Having switched from buybacks to special dividends, that objective isn't quite right. And our new objective fulfills all the functions of the previous objective, but it is more appropriate to what we're doing. So long-term, sustainable growth in total shareholder returns. This is different from TSR, as you know, which is share price positive within growth. What we're looking at here is growth in earnings per share plus dividend yield. And that is done in the belief that long-term, growth in earnings per share does eventually filter through into share price. \r\nI'm going to focus on 4 of those things in the presentation. Starting with retail space. That's now our quite old shop in Ipswich. We opened 11 new stores. We moved 8, we extended 13, closed 10. So net increase in stores of just 1:541. Total increase in space of 280,000. \r\nWhat you will have noticed is that an area that we haven't been particularly good at forecasting is our space pipeline. So -- and what's happened is we've consistently overestimated the amount of space that we will open. So for the year that we're currently in, a year ago, we were talking about 450,000 square feet. We're now talking about 360,000 square feet. That's not because we don't plan to open space, it's because it's taking much, much longer to open the much bigger stores than we had anticipated. Part of that is about simple build time, but by far, the most important factor in that is the planning and the deal side of it. And mainly, it's about planning. And the planners' motto seems to be that they won't say no, they'll just say yes very, very slowly. \r\nIn terms of the space that we have opened, in the year just gone, 40% of it was in Home departments. That's not all in standalone or big Home shops. Part of that is in fashion stores in town. So we're now at a situation where 25% of our space across the group is given over to Home. And in retail, that equates to around 16% of the sales. And that compares to around 18% of our sales across the group on Home across the brand. \r\nIn terms of the performance of the new space, pretty much as we expected, around 4% up both in terms of fashion and large format Homes. Return on capital comfortably below our 24-month payback. Profitability, pretty much 22%, and that compares to our rest of store profit of around 23%. That comparison of the 22% to the 23% is actually better than it looks because a lot of the -- some of the 23% will be in stores where their assets have already been written down and depreciation is very low. \r\nIn terms of the pipeline moving forward, this is our new shop that we're building bottom up in Hedge End, that's what we hope it will look like when it opens in August. Pipeline remains at GBP 1.1 million. But again, as I mentioned earlier, it has slipped back a little bit. 360,000, we intend -- we anticipate will open in the current year; 400,000 next year; 350,000 year after. In terms of what that space is made up of, 40% of it comes from the new large-format, side-by-side stores with a separate Home entrance and Home on 2 floors: the downstairs furnishing downstairs, the upstairs furnishing upstairs. We're opening 3 of those stores in the current year, and they will account for around 30% of the current year's openings. Just little pictures of them, York, Hedge End and Maidstone. Two of those we have designed the building, as well as the internals of the shop. And our aim here is to slowly but surely transform the nature of what out-of-town shopping means to the NEXT customer. \r\nI think -- I do think this is really important going forward, and not just for NEXT, but for the whole of retail. I think it's going to be important that we create -- that where we open out-of-town, we don't throw up big, ugly sheds because people won't be enthusiastic about it. But when you throw out something that is actually nice to look and nice to be in, people are much less antipathetic to it, particularly if it's got a nice cafe in it, which this one has on the mezzanine on the right-hand side. You can sit there and look at the roundabout and flyover, get a beautiful view of it. \r\nJust to remind you how our shop fit has changed over the last 7 years -- 8 years, this is what our new shop would have looked like in 2006. And the cost of that was GBP 127 a square foot. If you adjust that for inflation, in today's money, that would be GBP 149 a square foot. This is our latest womenswear shop fit in Romford. This is the shoe department. You can see it's got concrete walls, parquet flooring, a light well that we bought in through the stockroom to get some natural light into the back of the shop. And real marble tops on the shoe department -- on the shoe fixtures. \r\nThe interesting thing about this shop is that when you look at the cost of it, actually, in real terms, it's slightly cheaper than the shops we were building in 2006. And there are all sorts of reason for that, part -- building costs have come down, globalization on building materials, this meant that there are things that we can get cheaper. But the point we would make about this is that actually, the real investment hasn't been in the materials that we've put into the shop. It has been in the design work that's gone into finding the mosaic, and then buying it in enough bulk and in pieces that you can assemble it so that it is affordable.\r\nAnd within the business, we've used this. And I'm going to show you a couple -- I'm going to talk a bit about product now, which is always dangerous for a Chief Executive because you can sound a bit insincere and scripted when you [indiscernible] retail company talks about products. What I'm going to show you are some of the slides we presented to our staff to give you a flavor of what we're trying to achieve on product, which is really what comes down to the same thing, comes down to getting fantastic fabrics, great detailing on design. We design pretty much all of our products in-house, sourcing the trim ourselves and hand -- all the prints we produce, pretty much all of them are in-house prints as well. And it's a question of designing those beautifully, getting them right, and then buying them in enough volume to get them at affordable prices. And that is kind of the essence of what we're trying to achieve in our product departments. \r\nBut one thing we'll be very clear about, and I share it with you just in case you think we get all NEXT products, are they going to have bells and whistles on it, great design doesn't mean overdesign. So a great design can be simple. And great design doesn't mean just focusing on the top end of your price architecture. The basics must be well-designed, whether that be the slab fabric that we're using or the shape of the neckline on a T-shirt. Everything should be designed correctly. And that is the aim of what we're trying to achieve in our product departments at the moment. \r\nWhat we've also done is changed our buying cycle to make sure that our stock is more appropriate to the time of year and that our customers are buying it.\r\nTraditional retail buying cycles have worked on our spring, summer and autumn, winter collections. You'll see in the shops, the spring-summer range has just arrived. And there is a problem with that, in that when you sit down and do a spring-summer design work presentation, inevitably, you're thinking of summer rather than spring. And what's -- this just shows the performance of our womenswear clothing division in Phase 1 and 2 of spring-summer compared to 3, 4 and 5 of spring-summer, and autumn-winter 1 and 2 compared to 3 and 4 autumn-winter. \r\nNow there were other things that affected this performance. So it's not as dramatic as it appears on the screen in terms of the seasonal effect. What you can see is that underlying that, there is definitely an effect where we are designing our ranges in a way that isn't appropriate for spring or autumn. And there, at the bottom there, you can see a generic designer of no particular sex there. It's just a sort of a designer. When they're thinking of spring-summer, they're thinking of beaches. When they're thinking autumn-winter, they're thinking of Winter Wonderland. \r\nGoing forward, we're going to be more paired with the temperature. Because if you look at the last 10 years, what's interesting is that autumn is warmer than summer and spring is colder than winter. So going forward, we are buying 4 in 4 seasons, 4 design presentations for spring, summer, autumn, winter. Partly that means our stock will be more appropriate, although I should point out that this is not an absolute shift. \r\nPeople still -- if something's really fashionable and they really like it, they will buy summer dresses in early spring. So there will be a summer element to our spring ranges. But there's going to be more to buy that is appropriate to the time of year. What the customers will also see, more importantly, is a much bigger change going from spring into summer and from autumn into winter. And I think in the very long term, what you'll see is that our mid season sales accordingly increase in size, and our end of season sales reduce in size. It's not an effect that's going to take place immediately. We think over the next 10 years, we'll slowly see mid season sale increase in expense of the end of season sale.\r\nService is an area that we haven't focused on over the last 5 -- because I haven't talked to you about it over the last 5 years. It's not that we think we've -- it's not that we've been sleeping. It's that it hasn't been top of our list. And when you look -- if you look at where we sit -- this is an independent ranking of various retailers. I haven't named them to save any embarrassment for anybody. I haven't named the other retailers, but this is the main retailers you can think of on the high street. This is the percentage that rated outstanding, very good and good. And you can see we're about in the middle of the pack and not a long way behind #3, 4 and 5. \r\nHowever, if you look at the customers who rate NEXT outstanding and very good, the difference drops dramatically. And it's that -- it's moving from good to very good and outstanding that we are -- we aim to achieve over the next few years, both in our retail stores and as importantly, and in some ways more importantly, in terms of how we handle people in our call center.\r\nI mean, just -- I'm going to share with you a few of the things that we -- a few of the operational things that we've done to improve service. We changed our recruitment process. And the watch word here is to recruit for attitude, not skill. So in the past, we've fallen into the trap of, say, have you got retail experience? When did you last work in a shop? And actually, it only takes half an hour to an hour to train someone on retail. It's not -- it's a job where it's far more important to us that they come and that they're nice people, that they're team players, that they work hard, that they're enthusiastic, that they turn up on time, that they get on with their colleagues, and that they genuinely want to do -- give a good service to their customers. \r\nWe've been -- we sort of torn up our appraisal system, which is -- the appraisal systems that doubtless, you will be used to in the bank, and such great big tomes of paper that have no meaning whatsoever, but produce annual grind for people to sit through. We've changed that and done a TripAdvisor, very quick, 15-minute, half-an-hour appraisal, which we do 4 times a year, very simple rating system, 4 stars for excellent, 1 star for needs to improve or you're in trouble.\r\nWe've then taken that through into the way that we allocate extra hours. So in retail business, our peaks, we always have extra hours. When people go on holidays, we have extra hours. And in the past, that process of giving out extra hours has been done by the store manager asking people to go on extra hours. We've -- what we've done is we've developed a system whereby the staff can go on to sign in online or on their mobiles, 70% of them are doing this on their mobiles, and see what shifts are available on the different days of the week. They can then see what shifts -- what time of day their shifts are and how much they will earn. \r\nBecause we know it's them that's logged in, we know what their pay rate is, over 21, under 21, merit sales or normal sales consultant. So we can give them the actual amount of money that they will earn. They just click on it, accept it and that's it, they're in to work. What they can also do is give up time on there. So they can swap their shifts and offer them up. So if people want, for any reason, need time off, they can offer them on the marketplace. It's not guaranteed to go, but at the moment, we are getting around 80% of the shifts that we put on the marketplace are being taken up. \r\nAnd the nice thing about this is that it works with our appraisal system. And what we do is we give the 4-star rated people an extra day to look at those shifts. So they get a whole day to take those shifts before anyone else gets a look at them, then the 3 stars, then the 2 stars, and the 1 stars don't get a look at them.\r\nIn terms of online, I'm not going -- we've done a lot with next-day delivery to store, which you know about, so I'm not going to talk about that. I'm going to talk about international. International had a really good year. GBP 33 million 2 years ago, GBP 54 million last year. In the year just gone, GBP 101 million. Two things to point out about this. It was much -- this was much greater growth than we were expecting at the beginning of the year. We said GBP 70 million to GBP 75 million. The other thing to note is the slight decline in margin. This was something that we managed. We did 2 things. First, we saved a lot of money on distribution and operations and overseas in certain territories. And we passed a little bit more than that back to our customers overseas by way of permanent price reduction. So this wasn't promotion. This is just saying everything now on this website is now 10% cheaper.\r\nAnd it -- it was those price reductions more than anything else that has -- that drove the exceptional level of growth. We managed to achieve price reductions in 28 territories, which, between them, account for around 50% of our overseas territories. We also converted 5 territories that were trading in dollars or euros to their domestic currency and introduced one new translation, which was Chinese -- traditional Chinese for Taiwan. \r\nLooking forward to the year ahead, we're expecting around GBP 150 million growth. The reason that the growth is less aggressive than the year just gone is because we got far fewer price reductions. And when those price reductions annualize, it will be extraordinary if we didn't see a falloff in the growth rate. \r\nLooking to the -- we're not [indiscernible] looking to the year ahead, we've got 11 new territories we want to open. We're converting 11 countries to their domestic currency. That does have a positive impact in sales in our experience, but nothing like the effect of lowering prices. We've got 6 new languages that we're introducing on various sites across the globe and only 5 price reductions that account for just under 2% of the sales of our online business. \r\nIncidentally, one of the countries here that we're opening is China. This is the second time in 2 years that I've announced the opening of our Chinese website. And -- but this -- it's actually working at the moment. We've got it in test mode, so we are actually delivering stock to China. And you can't get to it yet, but that will come public in the next few days. Please don't expect too much from China. I think there's an enormous temptation to think that China is -- because there are 2 billion people, there'll be enormous number of sales. That is not our expectation. The vast majority of our customers, we don't think this -- our product will be appropriate for in China. So we're not too excited about that.\r\nIn terms of the outlook, a brief word about the economy. We are more positive about the economy than we've been for the last 6 years. Employment is looking good. Housing transactions are increasing, in line with growth in mortgage approvals. And this is definitely having an impact on our Home business, which has been our fastest-growing significant area in the last year. And that's -- and the space that we bought over the last 6 years -- we've pretty much doubled our Home space over the last 6 years. That is now beginning to really pay dividends.\r\nThe one thing about this that's interesting is although transaction levels are growing by 20% on last year, they're still 20% below the sort of run rate that the U.K. were seeing in the '90s. So we're not necessarily expecting the turnover of housing to drop in the next year. So we think that this is a permanent return to normality rather than an aberration. But we could be wrong about that.\r\nIn terms of credit flow, totals of GBP 7 billion, this is the Bank of England, flows of credit. This doesn't include write-offs or backers. This is real cash in and out of the economy. Significant change in 2013 compared to the previous 3 years. In total, GBP 7 billion of debt flowed into the economy. That's around 1% of total earnings in the U.K., total earned income excluding pensions. So it kind of makes up for the gap between -- and one way of looking at that is it kind of makes up for the fall in real earnings over the last year, which is one of the reasons I think last year was slightly better than we were expecting. \r\nBut obviously, that cannot continue forever. You can't have credit growing faster than earnings forever. And on the earnings front, for the first time, we've seen what might be some positive news on this. And the numbers out yesterday just showed that inflation and earnings almost touching -- still negative, almost touching. So I think we're at a turning point. It's very difficult to know which way it's going to go. There might be a blip, there might not be. But if it's not a blip and we see return to growth in real earnings, then I think that is good news for the retail economy. \r\nSo on balance, we think that things are looking slightly rosier in the economy. But there are risks. If we don't see growth in earnings, there is a question as to the sustainability of credit growth. We've all been there before. There's a real risk that the housing bubble in the southeast of the country will suck a lot of money out of the economy and encourage people to take on too much debt, and that will be not necessarily damaging in the short term, but in the medium to long term. When the interest rates go up, it will be very damaging. So although we're positive, we recognize that any real strong positive movement in the economy will result in an interest rate rise. And again, that will be a significant impact. \r\nThere's also GBP 1.2 trillion, GBP 1.3 trillion worth of mortgage debt. 1% on that is 2% of earnings in very simple terms. It doesn't all come through straight away, some people are on fixed mortgages, some people are below the minimum. But I don't think that it will be right to prepare for a return to the boom days because as soon as it looks like there will be a boom, the interest rate breaks will be applied and you shouldn't underestimate both the science of those interest rate breaks and the shock that people will get when they go up. Because although -- sort of it's a bit like death. Everyone knows that it will happen, but no one quite believes it. So it's a nice little analogy there for you, so to get the points across. \r\nBut I think that it will come as a significant shock to the U.K. consumer when interest rates go up. So we need to be cautious in our outlook, but we are slightly more optimistic. And for that reason, we have set our sales range between 4% and 8% maximum. That's the -- as the Chairman very gladly said vested, the highest sales range we've given since he was Chairman. We haven't been giving sales ranges for that long, for as long as he's been Chairman, I should just point out. But it is nonetheless quite an aggressive number for us. It compares to 5.5% last year. And you might think, oh, well, that's sort of typical NEXT, overly conservative. \r\nI would just remind you that if you look across the year, that 5.5% was hugely driven by the last quarter. And not only do we not expect the last quarter to be as strong in the year ahead. Because it was so strong, it will give us very tough comparatives. And our own budgets for the fourth quarter are extremely conservative because we know that some of the business that we won then, we are likely to lose. So if you look at the first 3 quarters, the run rate was 3%. And in that context, the 4% to 8% looks reasonable, if not aggressive.\r\nIn terms of what that means for profit, 4% to 8% profit range means we're still anticipating lower negative like-for-likes, GBP 12 million cost of negative like-for-likes, GBP 44 million of cost increases. The vast majority of that relates to wage inflation and occupancy cost increases. That will get you to over GBP 30 million of that cost. Still significant cost savings coming through in the business in Directory operations, still some savings to come through in retail operations and some balancing savings also in our occupancy costs where we've taken write-offs last year that we don't expect to recur in the year ahead, which all of you will spot on real savings and not cash, obviously. So slightly deceptive, this one. New space, we think, will give us GBP 15 million and Directory growth will give us GBP 49 million. So cost savings in Directory in equal measure, providing the lion's share of the growth for next year, midpoint of GBP 750 million. \r\nThat was -- so that gives a profit range of 5% to 11%. A dividend yield of 2%, and that's based on the share price around GBP 65. Special dividend yield of around 3%, assuming that special dividends continue. If they don't, that 3% will just convert into earnings enhancement by way of buybacks. So underlying total shareholder returns of EPS growth plus dividend yield, we're looking at somewhere between 10% and 16% in the year ahead, which we think is a reasonable ambition. \r\nJust in terms of where that sits, you'll remember, I showed you this graph 5 years ago of our ambitions for earnings enhancement, profit growth and dividend yield. We achieved 25% in the year just gone. That figure is a bit of a cheat because 5% of it came from tax. So underlying growth total return is around 20%. In the year ahead, we're looking at 10% to 16%. So still comfortably within our target range of 9% to 15% that we set the business 6 years ago.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thanks, Ms. Walter. Yes, welcome to our conference call on the preliminary fiscal year 2013 results. As always, before we start, some reminders. You should have received our press release, then the preliminary consolidated financial statements, our presentation. And if you have not received them, you can pull them from our website, which is continental-ir.com.\r\nWe will also release in the afternoon our Fact Book. It should be available after this conference call has concluded. And it contains then the latest updates on 2013 as well, of course, preliminary.\r\nTogether with myself here in Frankfurt, I have our CFO, Wolfgang; and also from our Press Department, Hannes Boekhoff. And Wolfgang will guide you through the presentation. Afterwards, we will host a question-and-answer session. From my side, that's it up to now. And I hand over to Wolfgang. Please go ahead.\n\n---\n\nWelcome, and thanks for your interest in Continental. Let me start with the most important KPIs for the full year of 2013, which are mainly in line with the key data which we have published already on January 13.\r\nOn Page 3, the most important KPIs I mentioned, sales were up in 2013 by 2% to EUR 33.3 billion, including an EUR 800 million headwind from foreign exchange rates, which leads to an organic growth for the full year of plus 4%.\r\nAnd specifically, Q4 showed strong growth with organic sales growth of 8%, profiting from new projects, which were starting in the second half of last year and, as well, tailwind from an increase in the car production and in the tire markets.\r\nThe adjusted EBIT was up by 4% to EUR 3.7 billion, leading to an adjusted EBIT margin of 11.3%, up 30 base points. And net income after tax, up by 1% to EUR 1.9 billion, burdened on the one hand side with one-time effects from refinancing, and supported on the other hand side from tax relief effects. Both effects together with the net one-time, a burden of roughly EUR 100 million.\r\nFree cash flow amounted to EUR 1.8 billion, another EUR 160 million better than the year before. And this number at the upper end of our communication in January 13, of more than EUR 1.5 billion. Net indebtedness, consequently down, EUR 1 billion to EUR 4.3 billion, gearing ratio at 46%, equity ratio at 35%.\r\nWe continue to create value with the trailing ROCE up by 60 basis points to 19.4%.\r\nThree other topics which I would like to mention as most important KPI. First, investment-grade rating was reconfirmed in the second half -- was in the second half of last year, finally given to us again after many years where we did not achieve that from all 3 rating agencies: Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. Secondly, dividend proposal from us to the annual shareholder meeting is EUR 2.50 per share with a payout ratio of 26%, up from the EUR 2.25 with the similar payout ratio the year before.\r\nThirdly, I would like to mention again the agreement to acquire Veyance Technology for EUR 1.4 billion, which we have announced on February 10 this year.\r\nTo give some more information about sales and adjusted EBIT by quarter, I move to Page 5 on a group level. Q4 showed an increase in sales of EUR 300 million to EUR 8.4 billion increase versus previous year. Organically, specifically, adjusted for FX effect, this is a growth of 7.7% for the group, and this is reconfirming our growth-supporting portfolio.\r\nThe adjusted EBIT in Q4 came out at EUR 942 million. This includes EUR 40 million for antitrust fine, which we hedged to book in Korea, and we did not adjust for it. Margin came out at 11.3%.\r\nThe Q4 leverage is 26% for the group, if I do not include these EUR 40 million antitrust burden. For the full year, the leverage is 28%. Again, the same adjustment with this EUR 40 million antitrust fine. Of course, on a group level, this was strongly supported by low raw material prices throughout the year 2013.\r\nThe split of these numbers into the Automotive group and the Rubber group reads on Page 6. On the left side, the graph showing the Automotive group numbers, sales growth of EUR 267 million in Q4 versus previous year. Specifically, burdened with FX. If I adjust for the organic growth, it's 10.2% in Q4.\r\nThe adjusted EBIT margin is 8.2%. Might appear a little bit below expectation, but please consider that EUR 40 million antitrust fine burden is included in these Q4 numbers.\r\nOverall, the leverage for the Q4 numbers for automotive is not very meaningful because of cost relieved, which we had seen in the Q4 2012. They had been accounted for already in the Q3 2012, as you can easily see on this bar chart on the left side.\r\nNow it makes sense to take a leverage of the H2 2013 compared to the H2 2012. This is 17%, and then I think this is a fair representation of our automotive performance.\r\nRubber group, on the right side, with EUR 3.4 billion sales in Q4, plus EUR 45 million versus previous year. A strong negative impact of FX. So in Tires, volume growth is always the better number, plus 7% in Q4, quantitated growth adjusted by FX of plus 6%.\r\nThe adjusted EBIT was up EUR 74 million, mainly due to the tailwind from raw material. The adjusted EBIT margin achieved 17.1%.\r\nOur gross profile, shown on Page 7. The Automotive group, upper left chart, was growing by 5% for the total year. But we will see later on in this presentation that this is not completely representative for the whole year, as we had an increase in growth rate over the quarters. And Q4, only in our Automotive division, as I mentioned already, was plus 10% by the worldwide car production, and the Q4 was 5%.\r\nNow sticking to the full year numbers, Continental Automotive group growth, plus 5% organically, while the worldwide passenger car and light truck production was up 3%. Our biggest market is still Europe and North America, plus 2%. In the passenger and light truck, tire unit sales growth, Continental, plus 2%, same development. After a week of first quarter numbers; we are increasing quarter-over-quarter. Replacement tire volume now again, full year, volume growth in Europe, minus 1%. Replacement tire; volume growth in North America, plus 4%.\r\nContiTech. Always difficult to find a real direct comparable number, but rose 2%; while the PC -- passenger car and light truck production in Europe was plus, minus 0; GDP growth in the Eurozone, minus 0.4%; so outgrowing the market on whatever indicator you might compare it to. And finally, the commercial, the Eco Tire unit sales growth, plus 6%; Europe market, plus 9% replacement tire volume; and NAFTA, minus 2%. I think overall, specifically, if you look at the development of the growth rates over the quarters of growth, 4, 5 up the corporation is reconfirmed, specifically in Q4 as well in Q3 and Q2. And we come to that on a later chart.\r\nPage 8 is showing the cost structure of the company, which could be improved over the past years. We do show here cost comparison of 2009 to 2013. The cost of sales, the light orange part of the bar, declined from 2009 to 2013 by 340 base points, from 80% to 76.6%, despite a rise in raw material costs from 2009 to 2013.\r\nR&D expenses as a percentage of sales decreased by 110 base points, but increased in absolute terms to EUR 1.9 million. Most of it, of course, spent in the Automotive group. Selling and logistic cost down by 60 base points. Administrative costs down by 90 base points. All this is supporting our improved profitability, as well as it is improving our position and resilience and stability in case of a new crisis should emerge in our industry.\r\nI was up to now mainly talking about the adjusted EBIT. Now the reported EBIT. The adjustments we have done follow thoroughly our adjustment policy, which is stable over the last many years, and this is shown on the bridge on Page 9. Reported EBIT in 2013 was EUR 3.26 billion. We had PPA of EUR 370 million adjusted for, and we had goodwill impairments and asset impairments of net EUR 119 million.\r\nOne impairment in powertrain, mainly HEV, Hybrid and Electric Vehicle business, where now all the goodwill in this business unit is impaired for due to the weaker-than-expected market development and as well, future market development. We had a second impairment in the interior divisions, specifically on Infotainment & Connectivity products, where we impaired goodwill resulting from the Siemens VDO acquisition. Different reasons which made up finely for this number. It has to be seen together with the restructuring, which you see under other special effects. We closed production in Australia, because business car production is moving into the ASEAN region. We followed them. We closed the factory in Brazil, where the store and vehicle tracking businesses is after now 3 years of discussion with the government, finally, not introduced. And we closed the factory in Tunisia, where we will specifically doing products for French customers, which show, of course, weaker take rates at the moment. So 3 different regions, which finally led to the restructuring, as well as to the goodwill impairment. And the third impairment we have done with EUR 41 million in trustee and safety, where we impaired our electric steering segment, because we will -- we decided to move out of that segment over the next year as we do not see that we can achieve a viable competitive position among the top 3 suppliers with a satisfying profitability.\r\nThe other special effects I mentioned already, there's the restructuring interior is a provision in Tire division of EUR 40 million. This is the provision for the closure of [indiscernible] operations in 2009, where the court ruled against us and 4 additional termination payments of roughly EUR 40 million. We had reported on this already in Q3 that we are appealing against this decision, but we have booked it with a EUR 40 million value.\r\nNet other special effects is EUR 50 million because we had positive effect from the SKI transaction. So from the joint venture with SK of EUR 23 million, which is adjusted for as well, and EUR 45 million from the sale of the S-Y transaction. So these effect netting out to minus EUR 15 million other special effects, and this leads to the adjusted EBIT 2013 of the EUR 3.7 billion.\r\nPage 10 is reconfirming we are creating value with a return on capital employed trailing at the end of the year on 19.4%, up from the 18.8% in 2012.\r\nThis is not only because of the improvement in the EBIT and the reported EBIT, but we manage the operating assets well. We even got the number, trailing numbers slightly down from the previous year numbers, EUR 16.8 billion compared to EUR 16.95 billion. And this is basically attributed to 2 factors: one, internal concentration on working capital reduction, which we obviously manage successfully; and secondly, we managed as well to adjust our investments to the lower growth, which we have seen during the last year compared to our original expectation. And by that, as well, awarded that the operating assets increase. And don't forget, this was achieved though they include the buildup of 2 new tire factories in Russia and in the U.S.\r\nWe have no change in our syndicated loan and bond maturities. As shown on Page 11, the first maturity is in 2016 of the term loan of EUR 1.5 billion, and then in the following 4 years, our 4 bonds with values around EUR 700 million to EUR 750 million. And as mentioned already, frequently, we think this fits quite well to the cash profile of the Continental Group.\r\nThe total liquidity, as shown in the table on the upper-right side of this graph, total liquidity, EUR 5.9 billion. This more than enough to run a company of our size in our -- and the structure of our company. And it is as well sufficient to pay the acquisition price for the signed acquisition of the Veyance business, expected to be closed in the fourth quarter.\r\nI mentioned already in another call that we do not rollout, though we could pay the acquisition part out of our liquidity line that we might do a debt capital market transaction, like a bond, at this point in time.\r\nPage 12 reconfirms that due to the continuous improvement of our operating performance, since Page 2 or 3, big rating agencies: Fitch, Moody's and Standard & Poor's, classified as in the investment grade.\r\nAll 3 rating agencies have confirmed their ratings after the announcement on the agreement to acquire Veyance. And this might be the right point in time to reconfirm our mid-term targets. Rating, if I take the S&P classification, BBB to BBB+; gearing ratio, well below 60%; equity ratio, well above 30%; and the leverage ratio, well below 1.25.\r\nAfter these corporation highlights, moving on to some more details on the Automotive group. And I would start with Page 14, which is showing the group sales by division and the adjusted EBIT development by division in 2013.\r\nAnd specifically, here to mention, before I get into the year number growth in the automotive was continuously increasing over the quarters. I will show that on the next page. So the full year numbers in Chassis & Safety, 6.7% growth; in powertrain, 3.4%; but Q4 only was 11%; and interior, 6%; leading overall to an Automotive group growth of 5.4%. Again, the Q4 only number, 10% organic growth.\r\nOn the adjusted EBIT side, we have: Chassis & Safety with 9.5%; powertrain with 5.1%, up from the 4.8% the year before; and interior with 8.9%. This is nominally below the 9.1% of the year before. If you consider the antitrust Korea fine as a one-timer and adjust for that, the 8.9% would read as 9.5%. And then the 9.1% of the previous year show that we are improved to the 9.5% this year, adjusted for this one-timer antitrust in Korea, leading to an Automotive group profitability of 8%. Previous year was 8.2%, but this year's numbers include an increase of 30 base points in R&D from 7.6% to 7.9% of sales as we are preparing for more software and electronic growth products over the next years. And if you then as well adjust for the antitrust fine from Korea, as I mentioned already, I think the numbers show that we are moving up the right path in our Automotive division.\r\nI've already referred to this slide on Page 15, sometimes. If you go to the left graph on this page, the light orange bar show our growth by quarter. The gray bar show the worldwide passenger car and light vehicle growth and the direct ratio of the worldwide passenger car and light vehicle growth adjusted to our market structure. If you compare those numbers, you easily see the increasing growth rates of Conti Automotive business quarter-by-quarter, which was supported by -- and as you can see as well, improvement in the market, but specifically, our outperformance, as well by new orders, specifically in the second half of 2013.\r\nAnd the same applies on the right chart for each Automotive division separately. All divisions were growing in Q4 by 10% or more.\r\nAnd the growth is taking place on Page 16, shown in those regions where we wanted it to be. The share of our Asia business in 2013 moved up to 25%. To remind you, 2008, first year of inclusion of Siemens VDO -- the full year of inclusion of Siemens VDO, the same number was basically half of it, only 13%. So it's, I think, reconfirmed that our target of 30% in 2015 is realistic.\r\nMany of these growth is coming out of China but it is including as well Korea. It is including as well Japanese business, and it is specifically as well including business with the local manufacturers in those regions.\r\nThe order intake in the Automotive group in 2013 was EUR 25 billion, as shown on Page 17. In Chassis & Safety, the book-to-bill rate is the lowest of all 3 Automotive divisions, with only 1.210 percent more than the actual sales. But please note here, that we do not have any order intake anymore for the electric steering business. I mentioned already that we did an asset impairment there because we will move out of this business. This is still accounting for more than EUR 200 million sales which are, in the end, not getting in into the order intake. And by that, the number is reduced.\r\nWe deliver in these segment: electronics and power packs, and we expect this to be taken in-house by today's first tiers. We are not a first tier in this business. And as I mentioned already, strategically, we think we cannot achieve a position which is according to our strategy. And by that, we'll move out over the next years, not take any new business there.\r\nIn powertrain order intake was again 1.5, 50% more than actual sales. And interior, 1.3, 30% more than actual sales. If you take that in combination with the strong order intake already in the years before, reconfirming our growth expectations over the next years.\r\nI move on to some more details on the Rubber group. Starting with Page 18, sales increased by EUR 45 million in the fourth quarter, mainly on consolidation effects, Conti trade's consolidation and that ContiTech-Lagan Metso acquisition. Tire volumes grew, I mentioned this already, by 7% during the quarter. FX had a negative effect on the Tire revenues of more than 6%, while price mix was neutral in the fourth quarter of 2013.\r\nContiTech sales increased by 6% organically during the quarter due to a strong OE automotive and aftermarket business. Still, weak industry business.\r\nThe adjusted EBIT was up by EUR 74 million, mainly due to raw material tailwinds, but also because of strict fixed-cost management.\r\nThese numbers, separately for the 2 divisions, on Page 19. Sales increased at ContiTech by 2%; Tires, 1.7%; so the Rubber group, overall, with a growth of 1.9% to EUR 13.35 billion. Again, on Q4, on its own, the message is different. As I said, Tire unit growth, plus 7%; ContiTech growth, plus 6%. Specifically in Tires, we finally do see some of the volume growth which we had expected already some quarters earlier, and we do see this to continue definitely in the first quarter of 2014.\r\nThe full year tire growth is composed of: for the PLT business, volume, plus 2%; price, minus 4%; mix, plus 4%; so balancing out FX, minus 4%. And the CVT business, same numbers: volumes, plus 6%; price, minus 4%; there is no mix effect; FX, minus 3%; leading overall for the Tire division to minus percent top line growth.\r\nOn the adjusted EBIT side, ContiTech was reconfirming the resilience with a 12.4% margin. Tires with 18.7%, of course, supported by reduction in raw material costs of about EUR 400 million in 2013, leading to the 17.1% profitability adjusted EBIT in the Rubber group.\r\nR&D, 2.2% of sales, nothing specifically to mention. And CapEx was 7.2% of sales, high, including 2 new tire factories in Russia and in the U.S.\r\nPage 20 compares in the upper graph over the last 4 years, with the Orange bar with sales; to the gray bars, EBIT; and the black bars, to the raw material. And the message is sales and EBIT increased steadily during the last 3 years, and it demonstrates our ability to pass on raw material price increases as we see this in -- as we see it in 2010 and 2011. And the price decline in 2013 is in line with the raw material cost relief.\r\nThe second message is to be taken from the lower graph. We had a volume recovery throughout the year 2013, as we have seen it in the Automotive group in PLT, the left graph, as well as in CVT, the right graph.\r\nMix was shown on Page 21, continuously improving in the Rubber group. 125 million units sold in 2013. Average sales price was down by 3% to EUR 61. These are the FX headwinds and easily indicated at the bridge I was mentioning before.\r\nThe share of high performance and winter tires and total unit sales improved to 45% from 36% in 2009; 41% in 2011; and now at 45%. We had 22 million winter tires sold on a worldwide basis despite a soft winter tire markets in Europe in 2013. So we achieved an increase of roughly 500,000 winter tires in the not-so-strong market. And our winter tire inventory now is healthy, if I look at the levels end of February 2014.\r\nI have talked about the increase in volumes over the quarters, quarter-by-quarter 2013. Page 22 is giving some information on the market. Many of you know that we had expected volume increases already in the second quarter of 2013 which, as this graph reconfirms, did not appear. Now we are at least noticing further stabilization and slight increase in the demand. And this is true for Europe, as you can see on the left chart, as well as for North America, which is shown on the right chart. And this, by the way, is reconfirmed til February, and we expect it to continue over the next month.\r\nOur expectation on raw material price development is shown on Page 23. The natural rubber price example here, TSR 20, is expected to average $2.50 in 2014. The synthetic rubber price, butadiene feedstock forecasted to average USD 1.50 in 2014. Message is basically in line with raw material burdens, which we have had in 2013. So basically, same price basis, which we expect for this year than for last year. But what we do expect is some price increase in the course of 2014 as demand further stabilizes, but this resulting in this neutral effect on the total raw material costs, 2014, compared to 2013.\r\nYou see some oil-based chemicals, textile and carbon black prices to increase year-over-year.\r\nAnd on Page 24. Just to reconfirm what I represented already on Slide 19, ContiTech, again, with very solid sales and EBIT development. The very stable sales development throughout the year was despite the slowdown in industry business. See the lower graph on this chart. Industry, minus 2%; the OE business, plus 3%; and the aftermarket, plus 6%.\r\nThe upper graph is showing a seasonality. The typical seasonality in ContiTech, always taking seasonality over the years, 2006 to 2012, gray bar compared to the orange line and bars. And you can see basically, seasonality came in on the sale side as normal, even better on the EBIT side suggested on the Q4 difference among -- between the 2 lines, which is shown on this graph. Mix OE, non-OE automotive in 2013, 56% to 44% at ContiTech. And the agreement to acquire Veyance Technologies from The Carlyle Group will change these numbers, as shown on Page 25. Although just to remind you, Veyance sales in 2013, EUR 1.5 billion with an EBITDA of EUR 204 million. ContiTech will form with this global player for advanced rubber and plastic technologies. It's a highly complementary acquisition, and specifically expense Continental's non-OE Automotive business and balances regional sales.\r\nSo the share at ContiTech, which I mentioned before, 44% non-OE. Automotive business will improve to 56%. And the sales split of Continental by regions will improve from 8% to 21% in North America, and from 8% to 10% in Asia, and at the same time, reduce the European share from 66% to 46%.\r\nThe deal will be immediately accretive to earnings. Enterprise value amounts to EUR 1.4 billion, transaction multiple at 7.3x EBITDA or 0.96x sales. And I mentioned already, the transaction can be financed from existing cash and credit lines. How do we finance? Finally decided most probably in Q4.\r\nEven after closing the deal, net debt EBITDA will stay below 1.0x by the end of 2014, and the closing is subject to the regulatory approval.\r\nTo finalize the presentation on the full year results, now some additional information on our indebtedness and cash flow. The net indebtedness bridge on Page 26, starting at the net indebtedness at the end of 2012 was EUR 5.3 billion. Dividend payments of $450 million, increasing the indebtedness; CapEx of EUR 2 billion, another increase; and then basically no change from the working capital; depreciation and amortization was a positive relief of EUR 1.8 billion; other cash flow, mostly the net income and other relief, leading to the net indebtedness of EUR 4.28 billion; and the full year 2013 getting the gearing ratio from 65% down to 46%.\r\nAnd this development is shown over the quarters since 2011 on Page 27. And just to reconfirm, we will stay at around 50% gearing ratio in 2014 despite the Veyance acquisition.\r\nPage 28 gives a brief comparison of the 2012 and 2013 cash composition. Cash flow from operating activity in 2013, slightly below the level of 2012. As well as some FX effects, of course, in there. Cash flow used for investing activities as well below the 2012 level. On the one hand side, we tried to reduce it because growth was lower than expected, but, of course, some FX affecting this as well, which made the free cash flow up to EUR 1.8 billion. And if you look over the quarterly development, I think nothing specifically to mention there.\r\nOur gross indebtedness by source is shown on Page 29. We have a term loan of EUR 1.5 billion maturing in 2016, and various other bank lines are at EUR 651 million, making up for overall bank loans of EUR 2.15 billion, roughly 1/3 of our gross indebtedness. We have the bonds in the amount of around EUR 3 billion, roughly 45% of our gross indebtedness. And the red is other indebtedness, EUR 1.5 billion. Majority of it is ABS programs, $900 million, and CP programs, EUR 500 million, some leasing and overall structure which we assess as adequate.\r\nI mentioned already other credit lines of EUR 3.8 billion plus cash of EUR 2 billion. EUR 5.9 billion in liquidity is more than sufficient for Continental.\r\nInterest results in 2013, with EUR 800 million more than EUR 300 million above 2012, as shown on Page 30. Is it not possible on first view, as our indebtedness was down by EUR 1 billion. Reasons are shown on this graph. The cost for the syndicated loan were down EUR 164 million to EUR 77 million due to lower utilization and lower market interest rates and margin levels.\r\nThe running interest expenses for the bonds amounted to EUR 223 million. And the one big nonrecurring effect in 2013, nonrecurring expenses from the early redemption and the call options of the bonds amounted to EUR 340 million. IAS19 had some effect. Other interest expense, net interest expense, got led finally to this more than EUR 800 million.\r\nAs I make it short, expect less than EUR 400 million interest expenses in 2014, as these non-recurring costs will not appear again in 2014, and as we are profiting from the refinancing of the bonds with low interest rates in 2014, and as we build profit as well from the lower indebtedness in 2014 compared to 2013.\r\nFinally, our outlook on the passenger car, light truck production by quarter and then outlook for the company on the next chart. Page 31 is showing the quarterly past and future expectation from us on European and North American passenger car and light truck production by quarter.\r\nAs you can see, we expect 2014, the first quarter, to be stronger than the fair enough weak first quarter of 2013. And then move in on previous year's level production. Meaning, in the end, we will continue on the run rate, which we have seen in Q3, Q4 2013 and as we had the weak third quarter in 2013, this will lead automatically in the first quarter of 2014 to some growth of 3% to 4%, which then is setting out to a stable development.\r\nNorth America, we see further increase to 16.7 million cars produced compared to the 16.2 million in 2013 and compared to the 15.4 million, which we have seen the year before. So this leads to the market outlook on Page 32. Europe, plus 1%. This is the effect I was just mentioning, specifically to be seen in Q1. North America, another 3%. And Asia, plus 4%. Specifically, again, driven by China where we do expect our industry to grow car production to grow by 8%. South America, our expectation, minus 4%, which leads to a worldwide increase from 84 million to 86 million units, passenger cars, light trucks produced in the world.\r\nCommercial vehicle production, our expectation slightly reducing Europe after Euro-6 has been introduced. NAFTA, plus 7%. South America as well, weak, was minus 4%. Asia plus 2%. On the passenger car and light truck replacement tire markets, we expect Europe to be up 2%. North America to be up 2%. South America, up 4%, as the replacement tire market is still profiting from the growth in the car park in the years before. Asia, up 6%, leading to a worldwide replacement tire market increase of 3%.\r\nOn the commercial vehicle replacement, same numbers read for the world, plus 4%. Europe, North America and South America growing in between 2% and 4%. \r\nAnd then finally, this leads to our outlook for Continental in 2014. We expect our consolidated sales to increase to around EUR 35 billion, this concludes already another EUR 700 million negative FX effect and we want to comfortably achieve adjusted EBIT margin above 10%.\r\nFor the Automotive group, sales, up by 5% to around EUR 21 billion and adjusted EBIT margin bigger than 8%. Rubber group as well, growth of around 5% to around EUR 14 billion, adjusted EBIT margin, above 15%.\r\nWe, as I mentioned before, don't expect any headwind for the Rubber group from raw material costs nor tailwind neither. We do expect, as we have in the group in normal years, around EUR 50 million of special effects. Net interest expense should be below EUR 400 million, already mentioned, tax rate, at the low 30%. Normal tax rate for the group to be expected within between 28% to 30%. CapEx at around 6% of sales, and PPA amortization to be down from the EUR 370 million in 2013 to EUR 190 million in 2014. Free cash flow, as we expect some normalization in the working capital, at least EUR 1.2 billion before acquisitions and before dividends.\r\nSo much from my side on the 2013 results of the Continental group. And now we are open for your questions. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nThanks, Ms. Walter. Yes, welcome to our conference call on the preliminary fiscal year 2013 results. As always, before we start, some reminders. You should have received our press release, then the preliminary consolidated financial statements, our presentation. And if you have not received them, you can pull them from our website, which is continental-ir.com.\r\nWe will also release in the afternoon our Fact Book. It should be available after this conference call has concluded. And it contains then the latest updates on 2013 as well, of course, preliminary.\r\nTogether with myself here in Frankfurt, I have our CFO, Wolfgang; and also from our Press Department, Hannes Boekhoff. And Wolfgang will guide you through the presentation. Afterwards, we will host a question-and-answer session. From my side, that's it up to now. And I hand over to Wolfgang. Please go ahead.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nWelcome, and thanks for your interest in Continental. Let me start with the most important KPIs for the full year of 2013, which are mainly in line with the key data which we have published already on January 13.\r\nOn Page 3, the most important KPIs I mentioned, sales were up in 2013 by 2% to EUR 33.3 billion, including an EUR 800 million headwind from foreign exchange rates, which leads to an organic growth for the full year of plus 4%.\r\nAnd specifically, Q4 showed strong growth with organic sales growth of 8%, profiting from new projects, which were starting in the second half of last year and, as well, tailwind from an increase in the car production and in the tire markets.\r\nThe adjusted EBIT was up by 4% to EUR 3.7 billion, leading to an adjusted EBIT margin of 11.3%, up 30 base points. And net income after tax, up by 1% to EUR 1.9 billion, burdened on the one hand side with one-time effects from refinancing, and supported on the other hand side from tax relief effects. Both effects together with the net one-time, a burden of roughly EUR 100 million.\r\nFree cash flow amounted to EUR 1.8 billion, another EUR 160 million better than the year before. And this number at the upper end of our communication in January 13, of more than EUR 1.5 billion. Net indebtedness, consequently down, EUR 1 billion to EUR 4.3 billion, gearing ratio at 46%, equity ratio at 35%.\r\nWe continue to create value with the trailing ROCE up by 60 basis points to 19.4%.\r\nThree other topics which I would like to mention as most important KPI. First, investment-grade rating was reconfirmed in the second half -- was in the second half of last year, finally given to us again after many years where we did not achieve that from all 3 rating agencies: Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. Secondly, dividend proposal from us to the annual shareholder meeting is EUR 2.50 per share with a payout ratio of 26%, up from the EUR 2.25 with the similar payout ratio the year before.\r\nThirdly, I would like to mention again the agreement to acquire Veyance Technology for EUR 1.4 billion, which we have announced on February 10 this year.\r\nTo give some more information about sales and adjusted EBIT by quarter, I move to Page 5 on a group level. Q4 showed an increase in sales of EUR 300 million to EUR 8.4 billion increase versus previous year. Organically, specifically, adjusted for FX effect, this is a growth of 7.7% for the group, and this is reconfirming our growth-supporting portfolio.\r\nThe adjusted EBIT in Q4 came out at EUR 942 million. This includes EUR 40 million for antitrust fine, which we hedged to book in Korea, and we did not adjust for it. Margin came out at 11.3%.\r\nThe Q4 leverage is 26% for the group, if I do not include these EUR 40 million antitrust burden. For the full year, the leverage is 28%. Again, the same adjustment with this EUR 40 million antitrust fine. Of course, on a group level, this was strongly supported by low raw material prices throughout the year 2013.\r\nThe split of these numbers into the Automotive group and the Rubber group reads on Page 6. On the left side, the graph showing the Automotive group numbers, sales growth of EUR 267 million in Q4 versus previous year. Specifically, burdened with FX. If I adjust for the organic growth, it's 10.2% in Q4.\r\nThe adjusted EBIT margin is 8.2%. Might appear a little bit below expectation, but please consider that EUR 40 million antitrust fine burden is included in these Q4 numbers.\r\nOverall, the leverage for the Q4 numbers for automotive is not very meaningful because of cost relieved, which we had seen in the Q4 2012. They had been accounted for already in the Q3 2012, as you can easily see on this bar chart on the left side.\r\nNow it makes sense to take a leverage of the H2 2013 compared to the H2 2012. This is 17%, and then I think this is a fair representation of our automotive performance.\r\nRubber group, on the right side, with EUR 3.4 billion sales in Q4, plus EUR 45 million versus previous year. A strong negative impact of FX. So in Tires, volume growth is always the better number, plus 7% in Q4, quantitated growth adjusted by FX of plus 6%.\r\nThe adjusted EBIT was up EUR 74 million, mainly due to the tailwind from raw material. The adjusted EBIT margin achieved 17.1%.\r\nOur gross profile, shown on Page 7. The Automotive group, upper left chart, was growing by 5% for the total year. But we will see later on in this presentation that this is not completely representative for the whole year, as we had an increase in growth rate over the quarters. And Q4, only in our Automotive division, as I mentioned already, was plus 10% by the worldwide car production, and the Q4 was 5%.\r\nNow sticking to the full year numbers, Continental Automotive group growth, plus 5% organically, while the worldwide passenger car and light truck production was up 3%. Our biggest market is still Europe and North America, plus 2%. In the passenger and light truck, tire unit sales growth, Continental, plus 2%, same development. After a week of first quarter numbers; we are increasing quarter-over-quarter. Replacement tire volume now again, full year, volume growth in Europe, minus 1%. Replacement tire; volume growth in North America, plus 4%.\r\nContiTech. Always difficult to find a real direct comparable number, but rose 2%; while the PC -- passenger car and light truck production in Europe was plus, minus 0; GDP growth in the Eurozone, minus 0.4%; so outgrowing the market on whatever indicator you might compare it to. And finally, the commercial, the Eco Tire unit sales growth, plus 6%; Europe market, plus 9% replacement tire volume; and NAFTA, minus 2%. I think overall, specifically, if you look at the development of the growth rates over the quarters of growth, 4, 5 up the corporation is reconfirmed, specifically in Q4 as well in Q3 and Q2. And we come to that on a later chart.\r\nPage 8 is showing the cost structure of the company, which could be improved over the past years. We do show here cost comparison of 2009 to 2013. The cost of sales, the light orange part of the bar, declined from 2009 to 2013 by 340 base points, from 80% to 76.6%, despite a rise in raw material costs from 2009 to 2013.\r\nR&D expenses as a percentage of sales decreased by 110 base points, but increased in absolute terms to EUR 1.9 million. Most of it, of course, spent in the Automotive group. Selling and logistic cost down by 60 base points. Administrative costs down by 90 base points. All this is supporting our improved profitability, as well as it is improving our position and resilience and stability in case of a new crisis should emerge in our industry.\r\nI was up to now mainly talking about the adjusted EBIT. Now the reported EBIT. The adjustments we have done follow thoroughly our adjustment policy, which is stable over the last many years, and this is shown on the bridge on Page 9. Reported EBIT in 2013 was EUR 3.26 billion. We had PPA of EUR 370 million adjusted for, and we had goodwill impairments and asset impairments of net EUR 119 million.\r\nOne impairment in powertrain, mainly HEV, Hybrid and Electric Vehicle business, where now all the goodwill in this business unit is impaired for due to the weaker-than-expected market development and as well, future market development. We had a second impairment in the interior divisions, specifically on Infotainment & Connectivity products, where we impaired goodwill resulting from the Siemens VDO acquisition. Different reasons which made up finely for this number. It has to be seen together with the restructuring, which you see under other special effects. We closed production in Australia, because business car production is moving into the ASEAN region. We followed them. We closed the factory in Brazil, where the store and vehicle tracking businesses is after now 3 years of discussion with the government, finally, not introduced. And we closed the factory in Tunisia, where we will specifically doing products for French customers, which show, of course, weaker take rates at the moment. So 3 different regions, which finally led to the restructuring, as well as to the goodwill impairment. And the third impairment we have done with EUR 41 million in trustee and safety, where we impaired our electric steering segment, because we will -- we decided to move out of that segment over the next year as we do not see that we can achieve a viable competitive position among the top 3 suppliers with a satisfying profitability.\r\nThe other special effects I mentioned already, there's the restructuring interior is a provision in Tire division of EUR 40 million. This is the provision for the closure of [indiscernible] operations in 2009, where the court ruled against us and 4 additional termination payments of roughly EUR 40 million. We had reported on this already in Q3 that we are appealing against this decision, but we have booked it with a EUR 40 million value.\r\nNet other special effects is EUR 50 million because we had positive effect from the SKI transaction. So from the joint venture with SK of EUR 23 million, which is adjusted for as well, and EUR 45 million from the sale of the S-Y transaction. So these effect netting out to minus EUR 15 million other special effects, and this leads to the adjusted EBIT 2013 of the EUR 3.7 billion.\r\nPage 10 is reconfirming we are creating value with a return on capital employed trailing at the end of the year on 19.4%, up from the 18.8% in 2012.\r\nThis is not only because of the improvement in the EBIT and the reported EBIT, but we manage the operating assets well. We even got the number, trailing numbers slightly down from the previous year numbers, EUR 16.8 billion compared to EUR 16.95 billion. And this is basically attributed to 2 factors: one, internal concentration on working capital reduction, which we obviously manage successfully; and secondly, we managed as well to adjust our investments to the lower growth, which we have seen during the last year compared to our original expectation. And by that, as well, awarded that the operating assets increase. And don't forget, this was achieved though they include the buildup of 2 new tire factories in Russia and in the U.S.\r\nWe have no change in our syndicated loan and bond maturities. As shown on Page 11, the first maturity is in 2016 of the term loan of EUR 1.5 billion, and then in the following 4 years, our 4 bonds with values around EUR 700 million to EUR 750 million. And as mentioned already, frequently, we think this fits quite well to the cash profile of the Continental Group.\r\nThe total liquidity, as shown in the table on the upper-right side of this graph, total liquidity, EUR 5.9 billion. This more than enough to run a company of our size in our -- and the structure of our company. And it is as well sufficient to pay the acquisition price for the signed acquisition of the Veyance business, expected to be closed in the fourth quarter.\r\nI mentioned already in another call that we do not rollout, though we could pay the acquisition part out of our liquidity line that we might do a debt capital market transaction, like a bond, at this point in time.\r\nPage 12 reconfirms that due to the continuous improvement of our operating performance, since Page 2 or 3, big rating agencies: Fitch, Moody's and Standard & Poor's, classified as in the investment grade.\r\nAll 3 rating agencies have confirmed their ratings after the announcement on the agreement to acquire Veyance. And this might be the right point in time to reconfirm our mid-term targets. Rating, if I take the S&P classification, BBB to BBB+; gearing ratio, well below 60%; equity ratio, well above 30%; and the leverage ratio, well below 1.25.\r\nAfter these corporation highlights, moving on to some more details on the Automotive group. And I would start with Page 14, which is showing the group sales by division and the adjusted EBIT development by division in 2013.\r\nAnd specifically, here to mention, before I get into the year number growth in the automotive was continuously increasing over the quarters. I will show that on the next page. So the full year numbers in Chassis & Safety, 6.7% growth; in powertrain, 3.4%; but Q4 only was 11%; and interior, 6%; leading overall to an Automotive group growth of 5.4%. Again, the Q4 only number, 10% organic growth.\r\nOn the adjusted EBIT side, we have: Chassis & Safety with 9.5%; powertrain with 5.1%, up from the 4.8% the year before; and interior with 8.9%. This is nominally below the 9.1% of the year before. If you consider the antitrust Korea fine as a one-timer and adjust for that, the 8.9% would read as 9.5%. And then the 9.1% of the previous year show that we are improved to the 9.5% this year, adjusted for this one-timer antitrust in Korea, leading to an Automotive group profitability of 8%. Previous year was 8.2%, but this year's numbers include an increase of 30 base points in R&D from 7.6% to 7.9% of sales as we are preparing for more software and electronic growth products over the next years. And if you then as well adjust for the antitrust fine from Korea, as I mentioned already, I think the numbers show that we are moving up the right path in our Automotive division.\r\nI've already referred to this slide on Page 15, sometimes. If you go to the left graph on this page, the light orange bar show our growth by quarter. The gray bar show the worldwide passenger car and light vehicle growth and the direct ratio of the worldwide passenger car and light vehicle growth adjusted to our market structure. If you compare those numbers, you easily see the increasing growth rates of Conti Automotive business quarter-by-quarter, which was supported by -- and as you can see as well, improvement in the market, but specifically, our outperformance, as well by new orders, specifically in the second half of 2013.\r\nAnd the same applies on the right chart for each Automotive division separately. All divisions were growing in Q4 by 10% or more.\r\nAnd the growth is taking place on Page 16, shown in those regions where we wanted it to be. The share of our Asia business in 2013 moved up to 25%. To remind you, 2008, first year of inclusion of Siemens VDO -- the full year of inclusion of Siemens VDO, the same number was basically half of it, only 13%. So it's, I think, reconfirmed that our target of 30% in 2015 is realistic.\r\nMany of these growth is coming out of China but it is including as well Korea. It is including as well Japanese business, and it is specifically as well including business with the local manufacturers in those regions.\r\nThe order intake in the Automotive group in 2013 was EUR 25 billion, as shown on Page 17. In Chassis & Safety, the book-to-bill rate is the lowest of all 3 Automotive divisions, with only 1.210 percent more than the actual sales. But please note here, that we do not have any order intake anymore for the electric steering business. I mentioned already that we did an asset impairment there because we will move out of this business. This is still accounting for more than EUR 200 million sales which are, in the end, not getting in into the order intake. And by that, the number is reduced.\r\nWe deliver in these segment: electronics and power packs, and we expect this to be taken in-house by today's first tiers. We are not a first tier in this business. And as I mentioned already, strategically, we think we cannot achieve a position which is according to our strategy. And by that, we'll move out over the next years, not take any new business there.\r\nIn powertrain order intake was again 1.5, 50% more than actual sales. And interior, 1.3, 30% more than actual sales. If you take that in combination with the strong order intake already in the years before, reconfirming our growth expectations over the next years.\r\nI move on to some more details on the Rubber group. Starting with Page 18, sales increased by EUR 45 million in the fourth quarter, mainly on consolidation effects, Conti trade's consolidation and that ContiTech-Lagan Metso acquisition. Tire volumes grew, I mentioned this already, by 7% during the quarter. FX had a negative effect on the Tire revenues of more than 6%, while price mix was neutral in the fourth quarter of 2013.\r\nContiTech sales increased by 6% organically during the quarter due to a strong OE automotive and aftermarket business. Still, weak industry business.\r\nThe adjusted EBIT was up by EUR 74 million, mainly due to raw material tailwinds, but also because of strict fixed-cost management.\r\nThese numbers, separately for the 2 divisions, on Page 19. Sales increased at ContiTech by 2%; Tires, 1.7%; so the Rubber group, overall, with a growth of 1.9% to EUR 13.35 billion. Again, on Q4, on its own, the message is different. As I said, Tire unit growth, plus 7%; ContiTech growth, plus 6%. Specifically in Tires, we finally do see some of the volume growth which we had expected already some quarters earlier, and we do see this to continue definitely in the first quarter of 2014.\r\nThe full year tire growth is composed of: for the PLT business, volume, plus 2%; price, minus 4%; mix, plus 4%; so balancing out FX, minus 4%. And the CVT business, same numbers: volumes, plus 6%; price, minus 4%; there is no mix effect; FX, minus 3%; leading overall for the Tire division to minus percent top line growth.\r\nOn the adjusted EBIT side, ContiTech was reconfirming the resilience with a 12.4% margin. Tires with 18.7%, of course, supported by reduction in raw material costs of about EUR 400 million in 2013, leading to the 17.1% profitability adjusted EBIT in the Rubber group.\r\nR&D, 2.2% of sales, nothing specifically to mention. And CapEx was 7.2% of sales, high, including 2 new tire factories in Russia and in the U.S.\r\nPage 20 compares in the upper graph over the last 4 years, with the Orange bar with sales; to the gray bars, EBIT; and the black bars, to the raw material. And the message is sales and EBIT increased steadily during the last 3 years, and it demonstrates our ability to pass on raw material price increases as we see this in -- as we see it in 2010 and 2011. And the price decline in 2013 is in line with the raw material cost relief.\r\nThe second message is to be taken from the lower graph. We had a volume recovery throughout the year 2013, as we have seen it in the Automotive group in PLT, the left graph, as well as in CVT, the right graph.\r\nMix was shown on Page 21, continuously improving in the Rubber group. 125 million units sold in 2013. Average sales price was down by 3% to EUR 61. These are the FX headwinds and easily indicated at the bridge I was mentioning before.\r\nThe share of high performance and winter tires and total unit sales improved to 45% from 36% in 2009; 41% in 2011; and now at 45%. We had 22 million winter tires sold on a worldwide basis despite a soft winter tire markets in Europe in 2013. So we achieved an increase of roughly 500,000 winter tires in the not-so-strong market. And our winter tire inventory now is healthy, if I look at the levels end of February 2014.\r\nI have talked about the increase in volumes over the quarters, quarter-by-quarter 2013. Page 22 is giving some information on the market. Many of you know that we had expected volume increases already in the second quarter of 2013 which, as this graph reconfirms, did not appear. Now we are at least noticing further stabilization and slight increase in the demand. And this is true for Europe, as you can see on the left chart, as well as for North America, which is shown on the right chart. And this, by the way, is reconfirmed til February, and we expect it to continue over the next month.\r\nOur expectation on raw material price development is shown on Page 23. The natural rubber price example here, TSR 20, is expected to average $2.50 in 2014. The synthetic rubber price, butadiene feedstock forecasted to average USD 1.50 in 2014. Message is basically in line with raw material burdens, which we have had in 2013. So basically, same price basis, which we expect for this year than for last year. But what we do expect is some price increase in the course of 2014 as demand further stabilizes, but this resulting in this neutral effect on the total raw material costs, 2014, compared to 2013.\r\nYou see some oil-based chemicals, textile and carbon black prices to increase year-over-year.\r\nAnd on Page 24. Just to reconfirm what I represented already on Slide 19, ContiTech, again, with very solid sales and EBIT development. The very stable sales development throughout the year was despite the slowdown in industry business. See the lower graph on this chart. Industry, minus 2%; the OE business, plus 3%; and the aftermarket, plus 6%.\r\nThe upper graph is showing a seasonality. The typical seasonality in ContiTech, always taking seasonality over the years, 2006 to 2012, gray bar compared to the orange line and bars. And you can see basically, seasonality came in on the sale side as normal, even better on the EBIT side suggested on the Q4 difference among -- between the 2 lines, which is shown on this graph. Mix OE, non-OE automotive in 2013, 56% to 44% at ContiTech. And the agreement to acquire Veyance Technologies from The Carlyle Group will change these numbers, as shown on Page 25. Although just to remind you, Veyance sales in 2013, EUR 1.5 billion with an EBITDA of EUR 204 million. ContiTech will form with this global player for advanced rubber and plastic technologies. It's a highly complementary acquisition, and specifically expense Continental's non-OE Automotive business and balances regional sales.\r\nSo the share at ContiTech, which I mentioned before, 44% non-OE. Automotive business will improve to 56%. And the sales split of Continental by regions will improve from 8% to 21% in North America, and from 8% to 10% in Asia, and at the same time, reduce the European share from 66% to 46%.\r\nThe deal will be immediately accretive to earnings. Enterprise value amounts to EUR 1.4 billion, transaction multiple at 7.3x EBITDA or 0.96x sales. And I mentioned already, the transaction can be financed from existing cash and credit lines. How do we finance? Finally decided most probably in Q4.\r\nEven after closing the deal, net debt EBITDA will stay below 1.0x by the end of 2014, and the closing is subject to the regulatory approval.\r\nTo finalize the presentation on the full year results, now some additional information on our indebtedness and cash flow. The net indebtedness bridge on Page 26, starting at the net indebtedness at the end of 2012 was EUR 5.3 billion. Dividend payments of $450 million, increasing the indebtedness; CapEx of EUR 2 billion, another increase; and then basically no change from the working capital; depreciation and amortization was a positive relief of EUR 1.8 billion; other cash flow, mostly the net income and other relief, leading to the net indebtedness of EUR 4.28 billion; and the full year 2013 getting the gearing ratio from 65% down to 46%.\r\nAnd this development is shown over the quarters since 2011 on Page 27. And just to reconfirm, we will stay at around 50% gearing ratio in 2014 despite the Veyance acquisition.\r\nPage 28 gives a brief comparison of the 2012 and 2013 cash composition. Cash flow from operating activity in 2013, slightly below the level of 2012. As well as some FX effects, of course, in there. Cash flow used for investing activities as well below the 2012 level. On the one hand side, we tried to reduce it because growth was lower than expected, but, of course, some FX affecting this as well, which made the free cash flow up to EUR 1.8 billion. And if you look over the quarterly development, I think nothing specifically to mention there.\r\nOur gross indebtedness by source is shown on Page 29. We have a term loan of EUR 1.5 billion maturing in 2016, and various other bank lines are at EUR 651 million, making up for overall bank loans of EUR 2.15 billion, roughly 1/3 of our gross indebtedness. We have the bonds in the amount of around EUR 3 billion, roughly 45% of our gross indebtedness. And the red is other indebtedness, EUR 1.5 billion. Majority of it is ABS programs, $900 million, and CP programs, EUR 500 million, some leasing and overall structure which we assess as adequate.\r\nI mentioned already other credit lines of EUR 3.8 billion plus cash of EUR 2 billion. EUR 5.9 billion in liquidity is more than sufficient for Continental.\r\nInterest results in 2013, with EUR 800 million more than EUR 300 million above 2012, as shown on Page 30. Is it not possible on first view, as our indebtedness was down by EUR 1 billion. Reasons are shown on this graph. The cost for the syndicated loan were down EUR 164 million to EUR 77 million due to lower utilization and lower market interest rates and margin levels.\r\nThe running interest expenses for the bonds amounted to EUR 223 million. And the one big nonrecurring effect in 2013, nonrecurring expenses from the early redemption and the call options of the bonds amounted to EUR 340 million. IAS19 had some effect. Other interest expense, net interest expense, got led finally to this more than EUR 800 million.\r\nAs I make it short, expect less than EUR 400 million interest expenses in 2014, as these non-recurring costs will not appear again in 2014, and as we are profiting from the refinancing of the bonds with low interest rates in 2014, and as we build profit as well from the lower indebtedness in 2014 compared to 2013.\r\nFinally, our outlook on the passenger car, light truck production by quarter and then outlook for the company on the next chart. Page 31 is showing the quarterly past and future expectation from us on European and North American passenger car and light truck production by quarter.\r\nAs you can see, we expect 2014, the first quarter, to be stronger than the fair enough weak first quarter of 2013. And then move in on previous year's level production. Meaning, in the end, we will continue on the run rate, which we have seen in Q3, Q4 2013 and as we had the weak third quarter in 2013, this will lead automatically in the first quarter of 2014 to some growth of 3% to 4%, which then is setting out to a stable development.\r\nNorth America, we see further increase to 16.7 million cars produced compared to the 16.2 million in 2013 and compared to the 15.4 million, which we have seen the year before. So this leads to the market outlook on Page 32. Europe, plus 1%. This is the effect I was just mentioning, specifically to be seen in Q1. North America, another 3%. And Asia, plus 4%. Specifically, again, driven by China where we do expect our industry to grow car production to grow by 8%. South America, our expectation, minus 4%, which leads to a worldwide increase from 84 million to 86 million units, passenger cars, light trucks produced in the world.\r\nCommercial vehicle production, our expectation slightly reducing Europe after Euro-6 has been introduced. NAFTA, plus 7%. South America as well, weak, was minus 4%. Asia plus 2%. On the passenger car and light truck replacement tire markets, we expect Europe to be up 2%. North America to be up 2%. South America, up 4%, as the replacement tire market is still profiting from the growth in the car park in the years before. Asia, up 6%, leading to a worldwide replacement tire market increase of 3%.\r\nOn the commercial vehicle replacement, same numbers read for the world, plus 4%. Europe, North America and South America growing in between 2% and 4%. \r\nAnd then finally, this leads to our outlook for Continental in 2014. We expect our consolidated sales to increase to around EUR 35 billion, this concludes already another EUR 700 million negative FX effect and we want to comfortably achieve adjusted EBIT margin above 10%.\r\nFor the Automotive group, sales, up by 5% to around EUR 21 billion and adjusted EBIT margin bigger than 8%. Rubber group as well, growth of around 5% to around EUR 14 billion, adjusted EBIT margin, above 15%.\r\nWe, as I mentioned before, don't expect any headwind for the Rubber group from raw material costs nor tailwind neither. We do expect, as we have in the group in normal years, around EUR 50 million of special effects. Net interest expense should be below EUR 400 million, already mentioned, tax rate, at the low 30%. Normal tax rate for the group to be expected within between 28% to 30%. CapEx at around 6% of sales, and PPA amortization to be down from the EUR 370 million in 2013 to EUR 190 million in 2014. Free cash flow, as we expect some normalization in the working capital, at least EUR 1.2 billion before acquisitions and before dividends.\r\nSo much from my side on the 2013 results of the Continental group. And now we are open for your questions. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text3": "Just one question, please, on your guidance. If I look at your outlook for replacement demand in Latin America, I'm just wondering why are you so optimistic in regards to this market? And second, in relation to Europe, just trying to understand why don't you see, on original equipment production momentum in Europe, why don't you see the momentum that we are seeing in the first quarter flowing through into Q2, Q3 and Q4?\n\n---\n\nWell, Latin America, the replacement tire market profit from car park increases over the last years and the replacement tire market's always up to 3 to 4 years. You replace your tires in the car park and as the car park was growing, this effect is overriding potentially some weaker overall economic development in that region. On European OE production, I think what you are mentioning as type of a tailwind in the European car production is what we explain more as the run rate on the second half of last year, which automatically leads to growth of 3% to 4% in Q1 as we had a very weak Q1 in 2013. But then, we do not see any further increase. At the moment as well, we are stable basically on those run rates adjusted by the typical seasonal effect in Q3 and Q4.\n\n---\n\nPhilip Watkins from Citi. I have a couple please. Firstly, on the replacement tire pricing expectations you have for this year. I don't know if you could just help us again understand what you're thinking there? Secondly, on ADAS, actually, I mean phenomenal growth in that business this year, is it likely that you'll sustain that kind of a growth? And finally, actually just on FX, I heard you say this before that you're not anticipating an impact of FX on EBIT for this year, I'm just wondering if you could just explain to us again why that's the case?\n\n---\n\nWell, replacement tire pricing, price/mix should balance out this year. This is our expectation and this is part of our guidance. Advance driver system, systems growth in line with the strong growth we have seen last year, which is more than 30%. FX effects, we are naturally hedged by 2 factors: on the one-hand side, yes, of course, we buy raw material specifically in the moving dollars, but we have as well exports from Europe to the U.S., which are positively compensating for that; and secondly, not untypical for an automotive supplier, we are producing the majority of our parts in the region, in the currency region, where we are having our customers' factories, so where we are billing in. So there is a natural hedge cost. And the invoicing currency is the same and therefore, we have a translation effect. If sales go down 5%, EBIT goes down 5%, but the margin stays the same.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And on the -- sorry if I may, just on the price/mix, so to say, rebalance this year. Is it -- we're talking about 3% negative pricing and 3% mix or can you help a bit more on the granularity of that?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's inline with the past and within that region you were mentioning of.\n\n---\n\nYes, I had a little bit more of a longer-term question sort of regarding the powertrain business and whether you see this sort of linear progression in margins as fuel efficiency regulations tighten? Or do you think we should see a sort of a sharp spike in '15 and then maybe again in '20 as the manufacturers -- as the regulations tighten? Or are people just gradually moving each year to putting in more content, if the questions make sense?\n\n---\n\nAs you know, these long-term questions, they will not be the one, the all new platforms, the platforms or motor platforms or motor derivatives starting in 2020 to make sure that the OEs can fulfill the requirements of the European legislation. We do expect the constant increase potentially somewhat stronger in the years '18, '19, '20. Specifically in the hybrid electric vehicle business compared to new applications, new products from our single motors in the years before, but there will be a constant increase over time. But powertrain margin, we have discussed it sometimes, are improving due to new orders which are replacing old orders, one. And secondly, we're somewhat lower than originally expected last year because specifically, the engine system business with smaller diesel engine supply to southern European cars sold in southern Europe, smaller diesel engine were much less than we had thought about 4 or 5, 6 quarters ago, plus weaker-than-expected business in the HEV area.\n\n---\n\nAnd could I just ask a follow-up on the rubber business? I think previously, you talked about 200 basis points decline in margin in that business in '14. You've now changed your raw materials guidance to being flat to rather than down EUR 100 million, what sort of level of basis points decline should we expect now?\n\n---\n\nWell, Kristina, I mentioned our guidance, we are talking for the Rubber group of adjusted EBIT margin of above -- and this is above 15%. And I think I would leave it with this at the moment.\n\n---\n\nI'm Thomas Besson, Kepler Cheuvreux. I have 2 questions, please. First, on the guidance, you failed to summarize it by saying you are more confident today overall than when you issued it in January between your upgraded both year on European production guidance and your assumptions on the raw materials front. So overall, is it fair to say that the level of confidence both our profitability has increased?\n\n---\n\nYes, this, I -- I would confirm this. I mean, after seeing the first 2 months in 2014 and as well now having an idea of how March is developing, we are more confident than this is the reason for the actual guidance which we have here. By the way, as by the previous years, now is we're coming out a little bit better than we had known in January.\n\n---\n\nOkay. On the tire side, 2 quick questions, please. I think you've been quoted talking about possible Asian acquisitions, could you elaborate on that? Do you have something similar to what Michelin is looking for, something that's like increasing your Chinese or Asian capacities?\n\n---\n\nCould you repeat that question? I didn't understand it.\n\n---\n\nYou have been quoted during a press conference, it was maybe Mr. Degenhart talking about possible acquisition in tires in Asia after the Veyance struck deal, would you mind elaborating on that, please?\n\n---\n\nWell, I'm -- we -- I don't expect in the next quarters to come any significant or even insignificant acquisition of any tire business in Asia. But I think this was a quotation which was probably taken out of what he was saying. The target for us is to be potentially strengthening our portfolio in the non-OE business. This is correct, and this is always including replacement potentially replacement tire markets, other tire markets and as well, the technical rubber products at ContiTech. Nothing specifically in the pipeline for any Asian addition to our portfolio on tires.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Can you give us a quick update on the new factories that you've just opened in Russia and as you are about to open in North America? How is it developing? And what's your degree of where you are confidence about them, your ability to use these new capacities?\n\n---\n\nYou have seen our guidance for growth, markets and our sales, so the additional EUR 1.5 million production in Russia, which we expect for this year, the ramp-up is running very much according to our planning. It's not at all an headache for us. We don't need this capacity and this is true as well for the 1.0 million additional tires which we will produce in the new factory in the U.S. as well, ramping up as expected.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. Quick and last question for me, please. Could you explain us the timeline we should anticipate between new order intake in the automotive business and its translation into revenues, please?\n\n---\n\nWell, of course, different from product to product but it is in between about 2.5 to 3.5, 4 years, depending on the product.\n\n---\n\nYes, 3 questions. The first is on the cash flow. You now had I think 2 years with neutral or positive working capital effect. Could we assume that there are some kind of a structural change? Or would you say that's, certainly, not sustainable and we would have to see a negative working capital effect in 2014, as I would read your free cash flow guidance? And secondly, regarding the earnings guidance, you provided a minimum margin target, would you feel comfortable to say adjusted EBIT should grow on a year-on-year basis? And the last question, again, on cash flow, given the revenues from cash flow generation, would you consider raising payout ratio at some point going forward?\n\n---\n\nOur cash flow has tried for a change over the last 2 years, though I could not confirm it. We are in principle of cash strong growth, as I think the last years have shown. We had this positive effect on working capital in 2013 and '14 in time payments of our customers more than in the years before. Could I guarantee that this will continue in 2014 following? No. So we don't see this as structure, but this is, for us, a little bit unpredictable and in the end, mostly dressing up or not dressing up the year-end numbers. This could be a negative effect in 2014, and this is included in our guidance. So I could neither exclude that the number is somewhat better. If we do not have this negative effect at year end, which I actually can only tell you finally at the beginning of 2015, as these are really effect for the one-day payment comes in 31st of December, or reaches us only on the 2nd of January. The adjusted -- I mean, earnings guidance, I would like to add anything to that but yes, we will have an adjusted EBIT growth in the logic of our guidance, which I was just explaining. The payout ratio at Conti has been traditionally in this range, 15% to 30%. We are not considering to leave this range over the next years at the moment. Because we feel our indebtedness, clearly down over the last years to less than EUR 4.3 billion now, gearing ratio, below our minimum target of 60%, our maximum target, if you look at the other way around. But we are still 3 to 4x more indebted than the majority of our competitors. So there is still the possibility, a way to go until we reach finally the average indebtedness of our industry.\n\n---\n\nIt's Horst from HSBC. A few questions have been left. First of all, on automotive, then you talked about sales growth of more than 5%, and I look at your order book and I also consider your statement that you have got a lead time of 2.5 to 3 years in the ramp-up of orders, is it fair to assume that most of the outperformance or most of the sales growth in 2014 will come from powertrain and that we see close to a double-digit sales growth in 2014, that we as see more subdued growth in Chassis & Safety, and growth also of about 5% in interiors? Then I want to know, the second question is in related to tires. When I look at volume outperformance in 2013, I mean, those are markets that you have shown in your slide on PLT. It accelerated in particular in H2. So should we expect in 2014 also the market outperformance in the magnitude of, let's say, 4%, 5% globally?\n\n---\n\nTo start with the latter one, as you had mentioned this outperformance in 2013, you're right. I mean we have this non-outperformance, specifically in the first quarter of 2013 and then in the H2, we had some out-performance. If you take our guidance now and consider the FX effects, which I was mentioning, we talked about the price/mix expectation as well. The guidance includes, and if you compare it to the market growth expectation, the guidance includes smaller outperformance of us compared to the markets. First question, automotive, all 3 divisions have their areas of specifically strong growth. We have advanced drivers assistance systems in Chassis & Safety. We have these connectivity topics in interior, and we have all these products which support the emission reduction in powertrain. I would not expect one division to be specifically strong. And we still have a little bit of this effect in power train of the lower order intake in the OE. We have discussed that sometime just starting in the years 2009, '10, we still have some impacts on 2014 as discussed before. So more balanced than your question was suggesting.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Because when I look at your order intake, I mean, in powertrains order intake compared to the current sales are particularly high since 2011 so therefore, I would expect here some outperformance. And also, another add on, I mean, so then we should expect also that the CapEx will grow more in automotive than in the Rubber group? And the last one, again, I mean could you specify maybe small outperformance in tires? What does that mean? I mean, can you grow with this 3%, 4% outperformance number for 2014?\n\n---\n\nWell, last one could be up to 3%. Powertrain, I mean, these -- when I talked about the lead time for orders, I mean, specifically motor platforms have longer lead times than other platforms in the cars. So this is more always at the further end of this overall lead time that we have in our product. And then, as now the third part of your question, sorry, was?\n\n---\n\nThe CapEx between automotive and rubber. I mean, we don't give the order book in automotive, it should increase strong as in, in rubber?\n\n---\n\nYes, in principle, you are right. Nevertheless, one factor to take into account, the unexpectedly strong growth for us in the truck tire business might require some short-term capacity addition as well in truck tires, included in our guidance. But this always is quite high in risk, as you know. So don't forget that this will be in the tire investment this year.\n\n---\n\nAnd when you look, Horst, I mean the CapEx and depreciation, if you exclude the PPA, it's also running in automotive ahead of the depreciation.\n\n---\n\nMichael Punzet, DZ Bank. I have one question as regard to your margin targets in the automotive divisions. After the acquisition of VDO, you implied guidance at a margin target of 8% for Powertrain. You already discussed that you choose lower volumes in Europe that is not be possible to be reached in 2014, maybe you can give us an update there? And also, for the other 2 divisions, because your guidance for this year implies that you would receive 10% margin target in 2014 as well?\n\n---\n\nYes, so no change actually to the discussion about the Powertrain margin is moving in the right direction. We have seen that as well in 2013. Very good flow than we had hoped for, as we had expected many actions in play to improve it. Unfortunately, market specifically in this HEV part and in the engine systems European diesel engine part was somewhat running against the margin development. And for the rest I mean, medium-term margin targets in the interior and in Chassis & Safety, all this, 10%. And I think we're on a good path. And if you do the math on interior and adjust for this Korean antitrust fine and then you compare the development over last year's, I think again, showing the path is right, and the path is towards the 10%.\n\n---\n\nPhilippe Barrier, Société Générale. Two questions. Once again, on Chassis & Safety, to know if will be possible to go over 10%. I think a few years ago, the division could get bumpy and stay at around 11%, 12%. I like to know if with some noticeable change with this division, which group will change the margin above 10% on Chassis & Safety? And second question is regarding the inventories. Inventories are -- level has been reduced a lot compared with the sales or in terms of presentation of sales last year. I'd like to know is there some impact coming from valuation of trucks or raw materials at the end of the year? And in case, we see some increase in rubber price in 2014, could we see some negative impact in the valuation of inventories on sort the -- by the end of December 2014?\n\n---\n\nOn Chassis & Safety margin, what is burdening the margin of Chassis & Safety now is the very strong R&D efforts for the advance drivers and systems business, which is very fixed cost, very R&D, very software driven. And by that, this year, and as well to next year, sees a very high cost impact from that point, from that side. And above 10%, as I mentioned, is our target and is within reach. And the auto advanced driver systems business, as soon as it is on full stream, I'd be having -- we have -- we do see the strong growth rate, I will deliver margins, as well of above 10%. Inventory, I mean, high concentration in the group over the last 3 years to get inventory levels down. So there's lots of operational optimization in the inventories. And by the way, more successful in the automotive area than we have it in the tire area because the tires as well variance production, and you have to have the right variance, the right type of tire in your stock to be able to sell it. People would not wait a couple of day until you have produced it, you have to be ready to produce. So the inventory has -- it's not only an optimization of an operating asset structure, it is as well more than on the automotive side something, which is not completely predictable if you have to be ready to supply and predict the demand very hard. Is it a valuation issue in there, raw material price? A little bit, not very much. If there is a valuation effect in there, it is the FX and the FX not affecting the quota but the absolute level. This has had an effect in there.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just a question on the CapEx, because you mentioned that during on 2014, the guidance is CapEx for roughly 6% or for news, I'd like to know if it is now normalized level of CapEx for the group?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nBecause I mean, for the year, the year after on, just on the next 5 years, syncs the normalized level of CapEx is [indiscernible] 6% given the structure of one as a group?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's a based assumption you could take at the moment, yes.\n\n---\n\nYes, it's Yen Shavna [ph] from Macquarie. I have 2 questions. The first question is on your Chassis & Safety order intake, even if you strip out the EUR 200 million of electric steering business, which affected this order intake, the order intake is still down, I just wanted to know whether you're expecting 2 or 3 year times a slowdown in your revenue growth on the Chassis & Safety side or is this just a temporary year-end affect that you see there? And the other question is on your exposure to Asia. Just wondering to know what your exposure to China is on the automotive side, if you could give us a rough guess? And whether you can say or not whether the profitability in China is higher than the average for the automotive business?\n\n---\n\nAnd while on Chassis & Safety, no, we don't expect a slowdown in the orders. And I have mentioned already, if you have those EUR 200 million in order intake, which is business, which is not going to be replaced or even it with 1.1 factor on that, the overall factor goes up to a reasonable growth rate. And in the Chassis & Safety business, a little bit below the expectation of our business in interior and powertrain. But Chassis & Safety has by its structure, as well as strong order intake from Japan, yen-based, so the FX effect in the order intake is stronger than it is in the other divisions, as well overall the international footprint. So this has had, as well, some impact in the there.\n\n---\n\nAnd Asia, China?\n\n---\n\nAsia, China, it leads specific growth markets for Continental with sales of more than EUR 3.5 billion, end of last year. And this is potentially above average growing market for us as we profit from the growth of the market. On the one hand side, and can outgrow the market due to additional businesses load for customers and as well, increasing installation rates of the more advanced products, which are part of our portfolio.\n\n---\n\nJust the margin is China is different.\n\n---\n\nOur margin in China is in 2013 as it was in 2012, basically, inline with the overall margin in the group.\n\n---\n\nJust very quickly, the advanced transaction, is there a clear idea when that might close?\n\n---\n\nWell, we need the approvals, which our expectation is to be all in, in the Q4 2014 and then closing should take place there. These are the only preconditions.\n\n---\n\nSo consolidate for 2015?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nOn tires again, can you maybe give us the ratio in the mix between OE and non-OE tires in 2013 and how much has it changed versus 2012? And then, regarding the mix between standard tires and winter and high-performance tires, we see in your charts that the share continues to increase. I mean, what ratio can we expect probably for 2014?\n\n---\n\nWell, we have seen this increase in the mix over last year's on a quite stable rate, and I have given the numbers for 2013. So it's always around in the range of 2% to 4%, more closer to the 3% increase in the mix that we have seen. Like again, the message on the price mix, the question before, should be balanced so basically, expect the same amount of mix increase as we saw it before. The question was on OE share, no stronger change in -- but we had a slight increase in the OE share in 2013. But nothing as really worthwhile to mention out of taken into account in any modeling of our group.\n\n---\n\nAnd you will see it in the SEC book issue and you should -- the Fact Book should be online this afternoon, as mentioned, and there you have all the details. So the price of high performance, I mean, the winter tires, as Wolfgang mentioned, at EUR 22 million, high performance is about to EUR 37 million in 2013 and all the details are in the Fact Book, Horst.\n\n---\n\nI have a couple of questions. The first is are you still breaking out within the rubber division, the truck versus passenger and light truck? And then where would I find that?\n\n---\n\nNo, we don't do this. This is no longer reporting according to IRS, and so we are not reporting these numbers anymore in our documentations.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And sorry to go back on the issue of price and mix. But you went a little bit quick for me in terms of the PLT and the truck guidance that you provided a little bit earlier, can you be very kind to just repeat that?\n\n---\n\nWell, we had a price/mix change on the passenger car tires of 4%, which was balancing out. And we had a price down on the truck side of 4%. There is no mix change within the truck tires. So this is not compensated by mix.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So as this was the last question, we thank you very much for the interesting questions and we look very much forward actually to speak to you later than on the occasion of our first quarter conference call, which will take place in May. And if you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate the team in Hanover my colleagues, Klaus, Henry, Michael or myself in the coming days, weeks and months. Thank you very much.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Jose Asumendi (Analysts)】\nJust one question, please, on your guidance. If I look at your outlook for replacement demand in Latin America, I'm just wondering why are you so optimistic in regards to this market? And second, in relation to Europe, just trying to understand why don't you see, on original equipment production momentum in Europe, why don't you see the momentum that we are seeing in the first quarter flowing through into Q2, Q3 and Q4?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nWell, Latin America, the replacement tire market profit from car park increases over the last years and the replacement tire market's always up to 3 to 4 years. You replace your tires in the car park and as the car park was growing, this effect is overriding potentially some weaker overall economic development in that region. On European OE production, I think what you are mentioning as type of a tailwind in the European car production is what we explain more as the run rate on the second half of last year, which automatically leads to growth of 3% to 4% in Q1 as we had a very weak Q1 in 2013. But then, we do not see any further increase. At the moment as well, we are stable basically on those run rates adjusted by the typical seasonal effect in Q3 and Q4.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Philip Watkins (Analysts)】\nPhilip Watkins from Citi. I have a couple please. Firstly, on the replacement tire pricing expectations you have for this year. I don't know if you could just help us again understand what you're thinking there? Secondly, on ADAS, actually, I mean phenomenal growth in that business this year, is it likely that you'll sustain that kind of a growth? And finally, actually just on FX, I heard you say this before that you're not anticipating an impact of FX on EBIT for this year, I'm just wondering if you could just explain to us again why that's the case?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nWell, replacement tire pricing, price/mix should balance out this year. This is our expectation and this is part of our guidance. Advance driver system, systems growth in line with the strong growth we have seen last year, which is more than 30%. FX effects, we are naturally hedged by 2 factors: on the one-hand side, yes, of course, we buy raw material specifically in the moving dollars, but we have as well exports from Europe to the U.S., which are positively compensating for that; and secondly, not untypical for an automotive supplier, we are producing the majority of our parts in the region, in the currency region, where we are having our customers' factories, so where we are billing in. So there is a natural hedge cost. And the invoicing currency is the same and therefore, we have a translation effect. If sales go down 5%, EBIT goes down 5%, but the margin stays the same.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Philip Watkins (Analysts)】\nGreat. And on the -- sorry if I may, just on the price/mix, so to say, rebalance this year. Is it -- we're talking about 3% negative pricing and 3% mix or can you help a bit more on the granularity of that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nYes, it's inline with the past and within that region you were mentioning of.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kristina Church (Analysts)】\nYes, I had a little bit more of a longer-term question sort of regarding the powertrain business and whether you see this sort of linear progression in margins as fuel efficiency regulations tighten? Or do you think we should see a sort of a sharp spike in '15 and then maybe again in '20 as the manufacturers -- as the regulations tighten? Or are people just gradually moving each year to putting in more content, if the questions make sense?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nAs you know, these long-term questions, they will not be the one, the all new platforms, the platforms or motor platforms or motor derivatives starting in 2020 to make sure that the OEs can fulfill the requirements of the European legislation. We do expect the constant increase potentially somewhat stronger in the years '18, '19, '20. Specifically in the hybrid electric vehicle business compared to new applications, new products from our single motors in the years before, but there will be a constant increase over time. But powertrain margin, we have discussed it sometimes, are improving due to new orders which are replacing old orders, one. And secondly, we're somewhat lower than originally expected last year because specifically, the engine system business with smaller diesel engine supply to southern European cars sold in southern Europe, smaller diesel engine were much less than we had thought about 4 or 5, 6 quarters ago, plus weaker-than-expected business in the HEV area.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kristina Church (Analysts)】\nAnd could I just ask a follow-up on the rubber business? I think previously, you talked about 200 basis points decline in margin in that business in '14. You've now changed your raw materials guidance to being flat to rather than down EUR 100 million, what sort of level of basis points decline should we expect now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nWell, Kristina, I mentioned our guidance, we are talking for the Rubber group of adjusted EBIT margin of above -- and this is above 15%. And I think I would leave it with this at the moment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Besson (Analysts)】\nI'm Thomas Besson, Kepler Cheuvreux. I have 2 questions, please. First, on the guidance, you failed to summarize it by saying you are more confident today overall than when you issued it in January between your upgraded both year on European production guidance and your assumptions on the raw materials front. So overall, is it fair to say that the level of confidence both our profitability has increased?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nYes, this, I -- I would confirm this. I mean, after seeing the first 2 months in 2014 and as well now having an idea of how March is developing, we are more confident than this is the reason for the actual guidance which we have here. By the way, as by the previous years, now is we're coming out a little bit better than we had known in January.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Besson (Analysts)】\nOkay. On the tire side, 2 quick questions, please. I think you've been quoted talking about possible Asian acquisitions, could you elaborate on that? Do you have something similar to what Michelin is looking for, something that's like increasing your Chinese or Asian capacities?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nCould you repeat that question? I didn't understand it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Philipp Gamper (Analysts)】\nYou have been quoted during a press conference, it was maybe Mr. Degenhart talking about possible acquisition in tires in Asia after the Veyance struck deal, would you mind elaborating on that, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nWell, I'm -- we -- I don't expect in the next quarters to come any significant or even insignificant acquisition of any tire business in Asia. But I think this was a quotation which was probably taken out of what he was saying. The target for us is to be potentially strengthening our portfolio in the non-OE business. This is correct, and this is always including replacement potentially replacement tire markets, other tire markets and as well, the technical rubber products at ContiTech. Nothing specifically in the pipeline for any Asian addition to our portfolio on tires.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Besson (Analysts)】\nOkay. Can you give us a quick update on the new factories that you've just opened in Russia and as you are about to open in North America? How is it developing? And what's your degree of where you are confidence about them, your ability to use these new capacities?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nYou have seen our guidance for growth, markets and our sales, so the additional EUR 1.5 million production in Russia, which we expect for this year, the ramp-up is running very much according to our planning. It's not at all an headache for us. We don't need this capacity and this is true as well for the 1.0 million additional tires which we will produce in the new factory in the U.S. as well, ramping up as expected.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Besson (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. Quick and last question for me, please. Could you explain us the timeline we should anticipate between new order intake in the automotive business and its translation into revenues, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nWell, of course, different from product to product but it is in between about 2.5 to 3.5, 4 years, depending on the product.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Schwarz (Analysts)】\nYes, 3 questions. The first is on the cash flow. You now had I think 2 years with neutral or positive working capital effect. Could we assume that there are some kind of a structural change? Or would you say that's, certainly, not sustainable and we would have to see a negative working capital effect in 2014, as I would read your free cash flow guidance? And secondly, regarding the earnings guidance, you provided a minimum margin target, would you feel comfortable to say adjusted EBIT should grow on a year-on-year basis? And the last question, again, on cash flow, given the revenues from cash flow generation, would you consider raising payout ratio at some point going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nOur cash flow has tried for a change over the last 2 years, though I could not confirm it. We are in principle of cash strong growth, as I think the last years have shown. We had this positive effect on working capital in 2013 and '14 in time payments of our customers more than in the years before. Could I guarantee that this will continue in 2014 following? No. So we don't see this as structure, but this is, for us, a little bit unpredictable and in the end, mostly dressing up or not dressing up the year-end numbers. This could be a negative effect in 2014, and this is included in our guidance. So I could neither exclude that the number is somewhat better. If we do not have this negative effect at year end, which I actually can only tell you finally at the beginning of 2015, as these are really effect for the one-day payment comes in 31st of December, or reaches us only on the 2nd of January. The adjusted -- I mean, earnings guidance, I would like to add anything to that but yes, we will have an adjusted EBIT growth in the logic of our guidance, which I was just explaining. The payout ratio at Conti has been traditionally in this range, 15% to 30%. We are not considering to leave this range over the next years at the moment. Because we feel our indebtedness, clearly down over the last years to less than EUR 4.3 billion now, gearing ratio, below our minimum target of 60%, our maximum target, if you look at the other way around. But we are still 3 to 4x more indebted than the majority of our competitors. So there is still the possibility, a way to go until we reach finally the average indebtedness of our industry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Horst Schneider (Analysts)】\nIt's Horst from HSBC. A few questions have been left. First of all, on automotive, then you talked about sales growth of more than 5%, and I look at your order book and I also consider your statement that you have got a lead time of 2.5 to 3 years in the ramp-up of orders, is it fair to assume that most of the outperformance or most of the sales growth in 2014 will come from powertrain and that we see close to a double-digit sales growth in 2014, that we as see more subdued growth in Chassis & Safety, and growth also of about 5% in interiors? Then I want to know, the second question is in related to tires. When I look at volume outperformance in 2013, I mean, those are markets that you have shown in your slide on PLT. It accelerated in particular in H2. So should we expect in 2014 also the market outperformance in the magnitude of, let's say, 4%, 5% globally?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nTo start with the latter one, as you had mentioned this outperformance in 2013, you're right. I mean we have this non-outperformance, specifically in the first quarter of 2013 and then in the H2, we had some out-performance. If you take our guidance now and consider the FX effects, which I was mentioning, we talked about the price/mix expectation as well. The guidance includes, and if you compare it to the market growth expectation, the guidance includes smaller outperformance of us compared to the markets. First question, automotive, all 3 divisions have their areas of specifically strong growth. We have advanced drivers assistance systems in Chassis & Safety. We have these connectivity topics in interior, and we have all these products which support the emission reduction in powertrain. I would not expect one division to be specifically strong. And we still have a little bit of this effect in power train of the lower order intake in the OE. We have discussed that sometime just starting in the years 2009, '10, we still have some impacts on 2014 as discussed before. So more balanced than your question was suggesting.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Horst Schneider (Analysts)】\nOkay. Because when I look at your order intake, I mean, in powertrains order intake compared to the current sales are particularly high since 2011 so therefore, I would expect here some outperformance. And also, another add on, I mean, so then we should expect also that the CapEx will grow more in automotive than in the Rubber group? And the last one, again, I mean could you specify maybe small outperformance in tires? What does that mean? I mean, can you grow with this 3%, 4% outperformance number for 2014?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nWell, last one could be up to 3%. Powertrain, I mean, these -- when I talked about the lead time for orders, I mean, specifically motor platforms have longer lead times than other platforms in the cars. So this is more always at the further end of this overall lead time that we have in our product. And then, as now the third part of your question, sorry, was?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Horst Schneider (Analysts)】\nThe CapEx between automotive and rubber. I mean, we don't give the order book in automotive, it should increase strong as in, in rubber?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nYes, in principle, you are right. Nevertheless, one factor to take into account, the unexpectedly strong growth for us in the truck tire business might require some short-term capacity addition as well in truck tires, included in our guidance. But this always is quite high in risk, as you know. So don't forget that this will be in the tire investment this year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hannes Boekhoff (Executives)】\nAnd when you look, Horst, I mean the CapEx and depreciation, if you exclude the PPA, it's also running in automotive ahead of the depreciation.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Punzet (Analysts)】\nMichael Punzet, DZ Bank. I have one question as regard to your margin targets in the automotive divisions. After the acquisition of VDO, you implied guidance at a margin target of 8% for Powertrain. You already discussed that you choose lower volumes in Europe that is not be possible to be reached in 2014, maybe you can give us an update there? And also, for the other 2 divisions, because your guidance for this year implies that you would receive 10% margin target in 2014 as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nYes, so no change actually to the discussion about the Powertrain margin is moving in the right direction. We have seen that as well in 2013. Very good flow than we had hoped for, as we had expected many actions in play to improve it. Unfortunately, market specifically in this HEV part and in the engine systems European diesel engine part was somewhat running against the margin development. And for the rest I mean, medium-term margin targets in the interior and in Chassis & Safety, all this, 10%. And I think we're on a good path. And if you do the math on interior and adjust for this Korean antitrust fine and then you compare the development over last year's, I think again, showing the path is right, and the path is towards the 10%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Philippe Barrier (Analysts)】\nPhilippe Barrier, Société Générale. Two questions. Once again, on Chassis & Safety, to know if will be possible to go over 10%. I think a few years ago, the division could get bumpy and stay at around 11%, 12%. I like to know if with some noticeable change with this division, which group will change the margin above 10% on Chassis & Safety? And second question is regarding the inventories. Inventories are -- level has been reduced a lot compared with the sales or in terms of presentation of sales last year. I'd like to know is there some impact coming from valuation of trucks or raw materials at the end of the year? And in case, we see some increase in rubber price in 2014, could we see some negative impact in the valuation of inventories on sort the -- by the end of December 2014?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nOn Chassis & Safety margin, what is burdening the margin of Chassis & Safety now is the very strong R&D efforts for the advance drivers and systems business, which is very fixed cost, very R&D, very software driven. And by that, this year, and as well to next year, sees a very high cost impact from that point, from that side. And above 10%, as I mentioned, is our target and is within reach. And the auto advanced driver systems business, as soon as it is on full stream, I'd be having -- we have -- we do see the strong growth rate, I will deliver margins, as well of above 10%. Inventory, I mean, high concentration in the group over the last 3 years to get inventory levels down. So there's lots of operational optimization in the inventories. And by the way, more successful in the automotive area than we have it in the tire area because the tires as well variance production, and you have to have the right variance, the right type of tire in your stock to be able to sell it. People would not wait a couple of day until you have produced it, you have to be ready to produce. So the inventory has -- it's not only an optimization of an operating asset structure, it is as well more than on the automotive side something, which is not completely predictable if you have to be ready to supply and predict the demand very hard. Is it a valuation issue in there, raw material price? A little bit, not very much. If there is a valuation effect in there, it is the FX and the FX not affecting the quota but the absolute level. This has had an effect in there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Philippe Barrier (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just a question on the CapEx, because you mentioned that during on 2014, the guidance is CapEx for roughly 6% or for news, I'd like to know if it is now normalized level of CapEx for the group?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Philippe Barrier (Analysts)】\nBecause I mean, for the year, the year after on, just on the next 5 years, syncs the normalized level of CapEx is [indiscernible] 6% given the structure of one as a group?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nYes, it's a based assumption you could take at the moment, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nYes, it's Yen Shavna [ph] from Macquarie. I have 2 questions. The first question is on your Chassis & Safety order intake, even if you strip out the EUR 200 million of electric steering business, which affected this order intake, the order intake is still down, I just wanted to know whether you're expecting 2 or 3 year times a slowdown in your revenue growth on the Chassis & Safety side or is this just a temporary year-end affect that you see there? And the other question is on your exposure to Asia. Just wondering to know what your exposure to China is on the automotive side, if you could give us a rough guess? And whether you can say or not whether the profitability in China is higher than the average for the automotive business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nAnd while on Chassis & Safety, no, we don't expect a slowdown in the orders. And I have mentioned already, if you have those EUR 200 million in order intake, which is business, which is not going to be replaced or even it with 1.1 factor on that, the overall factor goes up to a reasonable growth rate. And in the Chassis & Safety business, a little bit below the expectation of our business in interior and powertrain. But Chassis & Safety has by its structure, as well as strong order intake from Japan, yen-based, so the FX effect in the order intake is stronger than it is in the other divisions, as well overall the international footprint. So this has had, as well, some impact in the there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nAnd Asia, China?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nAsia, China, it leads specific growth markets for Continental with sales of more than EUR 3.5 billion, end of last year. And this is potentially above average growing market for us as we profit from the growth of the market. On the one hand side, and can outgrow the market due to additional businesses load for customers and as well, increasing installation rates of the more advanced products, which are part of our portfolio.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nJust the margin is China is different.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nOur margin in China is in 2013 as it was in 2012, basically, inline with the overall margin in the group.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Philip Watkins (Analysts)】\nJust very quickly, the advanced transaction, is there a clear idea when that might close?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nWell, we need the approvals, which our expectation is to be all in, in the Q4 2014 and then closing should take place there. These are the only preconditions.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Philip Watkins (Analysts)】\nSo consolidate for 2015?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Horst Schneider (Analysts)】\nOn tires again, can you maybe give us the ratio in the mix between OE and non-OE tires in 2013 and how much has it changed versus 2012? And then, regarding the mix between standard tires and winter and high-performance tires, we see in your charts that the share continues to increase. I mean, what ratio can we expect probably for 2014?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nWell, we have seen this increase in the mix over last year's on a quite stable rate, and I have given the numbers for 2013. So it's always around in the range of 2% to 4%, more closer to the 3% increase in the mix that we have seen. Like again, the message on the price mix, the question before, should be balanced so basically, expect the same amount of mix increase as we saw it before. The question was on OE share, no stronger change in -- but we had a slight increase in the OE share in 2013. But nothing as really worthwhile to mention out of taken into account in any modeling of our group.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Hannes Boekhoff (Executives)】\nAnd you will see it in the SEC book issue and you should -- the Fact Book should be online this afternoon, as mentioned, and there you have all the details. So the price of high performance, I mean, the winter tires, as Wolfgang mentioned, at EUR 22 million, high performance is about to EUR 37 million in 2013 and all the details are in the Fact Book, Horst.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nI have a couple of questions. The first is are you still breaking out within the rubber division, the truck versus passenger and light truck? And then where would I find that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nNo, we don't do this.

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, and a warm welcome to everyone out there for our full year '13 and Q4 earnings call for DPDHL. We are here at our headquarter in spring-like Bonn. And we assume that you've got all the material that we sent out this morning in front of you and/or follow this via the web. For our call today, we have our CEO, Frank Appel; and also our CFO, Larry Rosen, who will take you through the presentation and as usual, we will afterwards have time for answers to your questions. \r\nAnd with that, I'd like to hand over right away to you, Frank.\n\n---\n\nYes, thank you, Martin. Good morning, good afternoon from myself, as well. Thank you for joining us for the call. Let me go straight away into the figures and the presentation. So if you turn to Page 3. This is a, I think, a good summary of what we have achieved last year. We had a very good year. I think, again, based on delivering an EBIT, which is just in the middle of our guidance despite that the economy was not particularly strong. The key trends are still intact. We have benefited from our strong footprint in the international express business and gained market share. We also have grown and continues to grow our parcel business in Germany; it's very strong and had a good final quarter as well. We have, unfortunately, continued to see the headwind in the air freight market and the Ocean Freight market I will come to that later on. And that has result in a very strong cash flow driven by a very good performance also in the fourth quarter, but if we got that, Larry will explain more the flow over the year. We are very happy about that. And together with the significant increase in net profits, which is also supported by lower tax rate, when we originally anticipated. \r\nWe are happy to suggest an increase of the dividend to EUR 0.80, which is 40% lift to the previous year. So we think we have delivered all the targets of the guidance. Larry will show that in detail later on. So let me turn to the next page, where you see the different results. And if you look, start first with the group, it looks like that we shrank the business a little bit, but is only a result of foreign exchange headwinds. If you exclude that, we had been an organic growth almost 3%, and the fourth had shown the strongest growth in the year, with more than 4% organic growth. And that has led to a good development as well of our EBIT, with a number here of 7.5% EBIT growth. \r\nThe divisions are looking positive from the revenue perspective in MAIL. We have -- and you will see later on as well, we have nice development on the top line. The EBIT looks better when actually it is, if you compare year-by-year. It is a good number, we are now about EUR 1.2 billion, but we have last year a negative impact of EUR 150 million from the VAT and the State Head proceedings. And we have this year, as we already told you earlier, a slight improvement because we have released a post of provisions. So if you take that out it would be -- the number would be slightly down more or less on the same level as previous year. \r\nEXPRESS, the other way, is showing here no growth, but it has grown quite nicely, if you exclude foreign exchange. The profit has lifted more than it's shown here because we had last year about EUR 100 million, one-off effect as a positive in 2012. And therefore, if you exclude that, we have a nice development, which is above 10% growth from the bottom line, and you will see later on as well, the nice development of the margin. \r\nFORWARDING, FREIGHT has continued to be challenged from the market. Our strategy to be focused on profitable business has put pressure on our top line, so we definitely lost market share, but the profitability from the margin is still the same, as you'll see later and the profitability is only slightly down year-over-year. You are still the second best year ever in forwarding activities despite that we have a significant transformation going on.\r\nSUPPLY CHAIN, also challenged with foreign exchange changes, exchange rate changes, and if you exclude that, we are probably about 5% very nice growth. You will see later on that we had some positive one-offs in the fourth quarter, but if you take the year, those numbers are more or less on the same level, and we are compensating some one-offs positive in the last quarter, some pushback in the first quarter. So overall, that is a nice development. And as you have seen, from our release, we have now changes well in the management in best terms in a way that Bruce wanted to hand over to his predecessor in the moment, where we have to start thinking about the next step any way before I got our strategy and instead of me on board to start executing that [indiscernible] is better prepared that we head over. So that's the reason, why we have that change, it was not because the performance is just satisfactory or whatsoever. It is really because we think, it's a good timing for have a transition to the younger colleague. \r\nSo overall, we are happy with the numbers. If you go to next page, Page 5. You'll see that we even have seen in the MAIL, communication volumes an increase which is parcel has grown as well very nicely. The dependency on letter is shrinking as you see here as well if you look from revenue. \r\nThe E-Post revenue is now EUR 100 million, which is a significant step to the previous year. We have transferred as well some parcel operations in Europe to the MAIL division, which have an impact on the EBIT for 2014, and you will see that later on in the guidance. We have still a challenge that we grow revenue, but we don't generate more profit and that comes from factor cost increases, but also significant wage cost. And of course, we have to work on that, but the good news is that we have now a growing business again. \r\nEXPRESS is definitely our star performer and has continued so, very nice growth here in all dimensions. And also, if you look to the right, the margin has improved for the whole year and more than a percentage point in the last 3 quarters. So we are delivering what we have promised you a couple of years ago that we first to invest and then we expand margins, and that is happening. And Ken always said that 2013 would be a year of margin expansion. \r\nFORWARDING, FREIGHT, the good news on that page is that the deterioration of volumes is slowing. So you see here in the fourth quarter, we had less airfreight reduction than we have in previous quarters and in ocean freight, we have even an increase. So I think, we are heading in the right direction. Nevertheless, 2014 will be as 2013, a challenging year because we will go through the transformation organizationally, introducing -- introduction of the new system despite that we are making good progress, as steady here as well. There will be a challenge and also the markets are not yet, so much stronger than last year.\r\nSUPPLY CHAIN, also a new record number in new signings. I think that's a great number with EUR 1.5 billion. The business, we win is larger and has good attractive margins, which are higher than the existing business. So we believe that this we continue and I have no doubt that the new colleague, who is coming from the region with the strongest margin, Americas will help us to improve even further. \r\nSo these are the results from a high-level of a volume development. If I now go to Page 10, you see additional elements of what we want to do in e-commerce. Yes, we want to roll out now the parcel boxes in Germany. We have added additional services to our parcel products to make it even more convenient for our customers, so that they really have an easy life and get easy access. So we will continue to do that. That will be less an investment case, but in the continuous improvement overall. \r\nOn Page 11, you see the development of the revenue proportion which comes from the emerging markets. If we compare last year with 2009, we have seen a significant step upwards and that we have no doubt that this will continue into next year because with fundamental trends of globalization are still intact even if the growth is right in some of these areas is smaller than what it was.\r\nLast page, before I come to the guidance for this year and next year. We had invested in 2012 significantly. We have continued to invest in 2013, and one of the biggest investments, we will start now or have started last quarter is the expansion of our major hub in Leipzig. That's the result of significant growth. That's also, if you look later in the guidance, that's also the reason why we think, we will continue to see even a slight increase in CapEx because we see significant growth in our operations and to feed that and to continue to grow fast, we probably need more CapEx when we a couple of years anticipated. But that is not for any crazy things, it's really for supporting the strong growth we have experienced very recently and we want to continue in that path. \r\nPage 13, the guidance for 2014. We believe that we can deliver EUR 2.9 billion to EUR 3.1 billion. So another step into the direction of our 2015 target. We have increased the MAIL guidance to about EUR 1.2 billion. It's also driven by the transfer of some businesses from EXPRESS and that's a flipside that given the number is small in DHL and maybe then you have anticipated originally that, that comes also because we have transferred some activities, as mentioned about EUR 60 million from the DHL divisions to MAIL. The Corporate Center/Other should next year or this year better than EUR 400 million. We are very confident and the free cash flow should at least cover the 2013 dividend. Larry will talk a little bit more about some timing effects with regard to the cash flow. We believe that this is doable and we should see the same, what we have seen this year that we can really pay the dividend out of the free cash flow. \r\nThe tax rates should go up again and as I already said, the gross CapEx would go up to about EUR 1.9 billion. And that is only driven by our greatest success in the marketplaces and mainly by Parcel and EXPRESS. And if you look then on the next page, you see that we have not changed our guidance overall for 2015. We are still confident, despite it still needs hard work because the economy is not helping us, and currencies are not helping us either. That we are confident that we will deliver that number. We have increased MAIL as a consequence of some transfers as well to $1.1 billion and that's the reason, FX [indiscernible] being reduced the guidance for the DHL divisions and for Corporate Centers, it's still the same. \r\nSo we are, at the moment, confident that we can deliver the 2014, and this is another step into the direction that we deliver next year, as well the guidance, we gave you already a while ago. So with that, I would like to hand over to Larry to talk a little more about other some good financial [indiscernible] in the fourth quarter. Thank you for listening.\n\n---\n\nGood afternoon, everybody. I want to continue the presentation now with a deeper look at our financial performance for the whole year 2013 and also for Q4. And that will include also a review of the performance for the division. \r\nSo turning on to the next slide. We're very pleased that we've been able to meet or exceed all aspects of our 2013 guidance with growth of 7.4%. EBIT at EUR 2.861 billion was just about in the middle of our guidance range. MAIL, DHL and Corporate Center, each met their targets as well.\r\nAs forecast, net income grew faster than EBIT with almost 28% growth to around EUR 2.1 billion, and we'll talk a bit more about the reasons for that excellent performance in just a minute. And finally, free cash flow was a star performer in 2013 with EUR 1.65 billion of free cash flow generated, far in excess of what we would have needed to cover the dividend that we paid last May.\r\nOver to the next page. You see our dividend recommendation, which we hope will be approved in the shareholder meeting in May. Due to -- especially to the excellent cash flow and net income performance, the management and supervisory board have recommended the dividend increase of EUR 0.10 per share to EUR 0.80. This keeps us right in the middle of our target range of 40% to 60%, and represents an increase of over 14% compared to last year.\r\nNow, let's turn to the next page and look at our P&L for the full year 2013. So revenues were slightly down, as Frank talked about, due mainly to adverse currency movements. However, organic growth was around 3% for the year. MAIL EBIT increased significantly mostly due to onetime effects like the utilization of the stamp provision this year and the charge for the VAT settlement last year. \r\nDHL EBIT increased slightly, but was actually significantly improved considering positive onetime effects that we had last year and significant currency headwind, that we had this year. So MAIL wasn't quite as good as it looks and DHL was quite better than it looks.\r\nFinancial expense improved significantly due to the overall low interest rate environment and lower interest expenses on provisions associated with, for example, the large pension funding that we did at the end of 2012. Tax expense declined and the effective tax rate was far lower than we expected due to some favorable audit closures, both early in the year, so we knew about those, but also late in the year. So in Q4 and even towards the end of Q4. And we were also able to activate more tax loss carryforwards than we originally anticipated. As a result of these positive developments, net income and EPS increased by around 28% for the year. \r\nOn to the next page, we have a look at DHL margins, where we also were quite satisfied with our margin performance in DHL overall. In particular, EXPRESS could increase its margin by more than 1% to just under 9% for the full year. And this was a result of scale effects and efficiencies stemming from investments and initiatives that we have implemented over the last several years and also naturally the volume and revenue growth that we've been able to achieve. \r\nGlobal FREIGHT and FORWARDING could stabilize the margin at 3.3%, despite higher spending on NFE, and I'll come back to that in a minute, and lower revenues and also volumes. This was due to our selective market strategy and also strict cost control.\r\nSupply chain margin increased to 3.1% as the benefits of new, more attractive contracts improved our overall contract mix.\r\nAnd on the next slide, you'll see the P&L for Q4. And Q4 was, as usual, our strongest quarter of the year. Revenues also declined slightly, but we had our best quarter in terms of organic growth with 4.2%. EBIT increased by 7% over the very strong Q4 that we had last year. MAIL declined slightly as the benefits from Letter and Parcel volume growth could not quite offset the increase in factor cost, in particular, labor costs. \r\nDHL improved significantly with 13% growth over Q4 of 2012, led especially by EXPRESS and SUPPLY CHAIN. And the good results in financial and tax expense that I mentioned already were especially evident in Q4. This combined with the growth in EBIT, led to a 44% growth in net income just for the quarter.\r\nAnd looking on to Page 8, as mentioned, we have very strong cash flow for 2013, and a great finish to the year in Q4. We saw the typical seasonal pattern in 2013, where the second half is much stronger than the first half and certainly 2013, was no exception.\r\nIn Q3 and Q4, we were able to preserve and even build on the outperformance that we had already achieved in the first half compared to previous years.\r\nIn expanding on free cash flow performance on the next page. In Q4 of 2012, most of you know that we have the approximately EUR 2 billion pension funding, which from an accounting point of view, is a reduction in operating cash flow. Correcting for that pension funding, you see a much cleaner comparison in the right 2 columns of cash flow performance just for Q4. Here are better operating earnings, a very good performance on working capital reduction with contributions from both receivables reduction and increases in payables and lower cash out for CapEx, all contributed to the free cash flow generation of over EUR 1 billion.\r\nAs mentioned, we had some timing effects, which make part of the very strong cash flow generation transitory in nature. In particular, we booked a fair amount of CapEx, just toward the end of the year, where the cash out will occur or has occurred in 2014. We estimate that in total, these transitory effects amount to between EUR 300 million and EUR 400 million with the largest effect being the just mentioned CapEx effect.\r\nOn to the next page. We're very pleased to be able to reduce our net debt by around EUR 470 million for the year, with the big reduction of around EUR 1 billion in Q4. Adjusting for the pension funding, we did at the end of 2012 of EUR 2 billion, we actually would've been cash positive again at the end of 2013 as we were in 2010 and 2011.\r\nWe expect to again follow our seasonal pattern in 2014, so that our net debt should increase during the first half then improve considerably during the second half of the year.\r\nAnd now, over 2 pages, we'll take a look at each division's performance. And we'll start with the Mail division, where revenues increased also in Q4, due to the stamp price increase from the beginning of the year. Increased traffic due to the SEPA preparation. For those that don't know, SEPA is a new vehicle for electronic payments that's being rolled out first in the Eurozone and then later in all of the EU in 2016. It was supposed to have been implemented on February 1. That got delayed at the last minute to August 1. Nevertheless, there was a lot of mail traffic, both the businesses and private individuals, instructing them how to be compliant with SEPA. And that really had a benefit for our MAIL business in terms of volumes in Q4. \r\nWe've also seen that EBIT, while on a satisfactory level, declined slightly as the benefits of revenue growth could not quite cover the increase in factor costs, most importantly labor cost. The cash flow trend is distorted by the pension funding from the end of 2012, where 95% or EUR 1.9 billion of the EUR 2 billion pension funding is attributed to the MAIL division since most of the retirees are MAIL retirees.\r\nCapEx increased significantly year-over-year, and compared to the first 3 quarters of this year. As we spent more on expanding and improving our Parcel infrastructure, in particular for the Parcel project 2012. \r\nAnd moving on to EXPRESS. The division continued to perform very well in Q4. Revenues were significantly affected by currency movement and to a lesser extent, by smaller divestitures. Organic revenue growth was close to 6%. EBIT increased by over 14% and the operating margin increased by 120 basis points to 9.6% in Q4. And the primary drivers for the improvement are continued strong TDI volume growth, driving scale benefits, as well as the efficiency benefits enabled by investments in the ground and air network over the last years. Cash flow was very strong with an increase of 19% compared to last year. \r\nAnd moving now to Global FORWARDING and FREIGHT. They really have continued to be affected by trends that we've seen in previous quarters. Revenue declined due to continued weak volume trends, driven by an overall weak market environment and a particular impact on us due to our sector and customer mix. With our leadership position in airfreight, we've been especially affected by structural changes causing down trading in technology or modal shift in technology and a weak engineering and manufacturing sector. \r\nIn addition, our road freight business is largely concentrated in Europe, where the economy has been comparatively softer compared to other regions. And of course, we're implementing the comprehensive change initiative called NFE amid these weak market conditions. And in Q4, we spent more than in previous quarters on NFE implementation. \r\nIn recent months, we've seen signs of recovery in volumes, though the trend in gross profit margins remains challenging. And last but not least, SUPPLY CHAIN, on the next page, the SUPPLY CHAIN division continues to perform well, benefiting from a strong trend in new business generation and the accompanying benefits from a continuously improving contract mix that we're able, as a result, to achieve. EBIT benefited from net positive onetime effects in Q4 of around EUR 30 million, but nevertheless, increased by around 28% even without that effect. For the full year, positive and negative onetime effects for the division, just about fully offset each other, so that the improvement for the full year was around 5%, with an increase in EBIT margin from 2.9% to 3.1%. Cash flow was very strong in Q4, with the biggest contributor being a reduction in working capital.\r\nAnd wrapping up on the last page of the presentation. MAIL EBIT has clearly been stabilized above EUR 1 billion, our longtime target in strategy 2015. We've made further progress on DHL profitability improvement with strong improvement in EXPRESS. We had a very strong 2013 cash flow performance. However, with the mentioned timing effects, and we confirm again our 2015 group guidance. Please remember to save the date for our Capital Markets Day on April 2nd in Frankfurt. We'll be very pleased if you're able to join us. And now, we will be happy to answer any questions you might have.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Frank, thanks, Larry. And operator, if you could start the Q&A sequence, please.",

I want to continue the presentation now with a deeper look at our financial performance for the whole year 2013 and also for Q4. And that will include also a review of the performance for the division. \r\nSo turning on to the next slide. We're very pleased that we've been able to meet or exceed all aspects of our 2013 guidance with growth of 7.4%. EBIT at EUR 2.861 billion was just about in the middle of our guidance range. MAIL, DHL and Corporate Center, each met their targets as well.\r\nAs forecast, net income grew faster than EBIT with almost 28% growth to around EUR 2.1 billion, and we'll talk a bit more about the reasons for that excellent performance in just a minute. And finally, free cash flow was a star performer in 2013 with EUR 1.65 billion of free cash flow generated, far in excess of what we would have needed to cover the dividend that we paid last May.\r\nOver to the next page. You see our dividend recommendation, which we hope will be approved in the shareholder meeting in May. Due to -- especially to the excellent cash flow and net income performance, the management and supervisory board have recommended the dividend increase of EUR 0.10 per share to EUR 0.80. This keeps us right in the middle of our target range of 40% to 60%, and represents an increase of over 14% compared to last year.\r\nNow, let's turn to the next page and look at our P&L for the full year 2013. So revenues were slightly down, as Frank talked about, due mainly to adverse currency movements. However, organic growth was around 3% for the year. MAIL EBIT increased significantly mostly due to onetime effects like the utilization of the stamp provision this year and the charge for the VAT settlement last year. \r\nDHL EBIT increased slightly, but was actually significantly improved considering positive onetime effects that we had last year and significant currency headwind, that we had this year. So MAIL wasn't quite as good as it looks and DHL was quite better than it looks.\r\nFinancial expense improved significantly due to the overall low interest rate environment and lower interest expenses on provisions associated with, for example, the large pension funding that we did at the end of 2012. Tax expense declined and the effective tax rate was far lower than we expected due to some favorable audit closures, both early in the year, so we knew about those, but also late in the year. So in Q4 and even towards the end of Q4. And we were also able to activate more tax loss carryforwards than we originally anticipated. As a result of these positive developments, net income and EPS increased by around 28% for the year. \r\nOn to the next page, we have a look at DHL margins, where we also were quite satisfied with our margin performance in DHL overall. In particular, EXPRESS could increase its margin by more than 1% to just under 9% for the full year. And this was a result of scale effects and efficiencies stemming from investments and initiatives that we have implemented over the last several years and also naturally the volume and revenue growth that we've been able to achieve. \r\nGlobal FREIGHT and FORWARDING could stabilize the margin at 3.3%, despite higher spending on NFE, and I'll come back to that in a minute, and lower revenues and also volumes. This was due to our selective market strategy and also strict cost control.\r\nSupply chain margin increased to 3.1% as the benefits of new, more attractive contracts improved our overall contract mix.\r\nAnd on the next slide, you'll see the P&L for Q4. And Q4 was, as usual, our strongest quarter of the year. Revenues also declined slightly, but we had our best quarter in terms of organic growth with 4.2%. EBIT increased by 7% over the very strong Q4 that we had last year. MAIL declined slightly as the benefits from Letter and Parcel volume growth could not quite offset the increase in factor cost, in particular, labor costs. \r\nDHL improved significantly with 13% growth over Q4 of 2012, led especially by EXPRESS and SUPPLY CHAIN. And the good results in financial and tax expense that I mentioned already were especially evident in Q4. This combined with the growth in EBIT, led to a 44% growth in net income just for the quarter.\r\nAnd looking on to Page 8, as mentioned, we have very strong cash flow for 2013, and a great finish to the year in Q4. We saw the typical seasonal pattern in 2013, where the second half is much stronger than the first half and certainly 2013, was no exception.\r\nIn Q3 and Q4, we were able to preserve and even build on the outperformance that we had already achieved in the first half compared to previous years.\r\nIn expanding on free cash flow performance on the next page. In Q4 of 2012, most of you know that we have the approximately EUR 2 billion pension funding, which from an accounting point of view, is a reduction in operating cash flow. Correcting for that pension funding, you see a much cleaner comparison in the right 2 columns of cash flow performance just for Q4. Here are better operating earnings, a very good performance on working capital reduction with contributions from both receivables reduction and increases in payables and lower cash out for CapEx, all contributed to the free cash flow generation of over EUR 1 billion.\r\nAs mentioned, we had some timing effects, which make part of the very strong cash flow generation transitory in nature. In particular, we booked a fair amount of CapEx, just toward the end of the year, where the cash out will occur or has occurred in 2014. We estimate that in total, these transitory effects amount to between EUR 300 million and EUR 400 million with the largest effect being the just mentioned CapEx effect.\r\nOn to the next page. We're very pleased to be able to reduce our net debt by around EUR 470 million for the year, with the big reduction of around EUR 1 billion in Q4. Adjusting for the pension funding, we did at the end of 2012 of EUR 2 billion, we actually would've been cash positive again at the end of 2013 as we were in 2010 and 2011.\r\nWe expect to again follow our seasonal pattern in 2014, so that our net debt should increase during the first half then improve considerably during the second half of the year.\r\nAnd now, over 2 pages, we'll take a look at each division's performance. And we'll start with the Mail division, where revenues increased also in Q4, due to the stamp price increase from the beginning of the year. Increased traffic due to the SEPA preparation. For those that don't know, SEPA is a new vehicle for electronic payments that's being rolled out first in the Eurozone and then later in all of the EU in 2016. It was supposed to have been implemented on February 1. That got delayed at the last minute to August 1. Nevertheless, there was a lot of mail traffic, both the businesses and private individuals, instructing them how to be compliant with SEPA. And that really had a benefit for our MAIL business in terms of volumes in Q4. \r\nWe've also seen that EBIT, while on a satisfactory level, declined slightly as the benefits of revenue growth could not quite cover the increase in factor costs, most importantly labor cost. The cash flow trend is distorted by the pension funding from the end of 2012, where 95% or EUR 1.9 billion of the EUR 2 billion pension funding is attributed to the MAIL division since most of the retirees are MAIL retirees.\r\nCapEx increased significantly year-over-year, and compared to the first 3 quarters of this year. As we spent more on expanding and improving our Parcel infrastructure, in particular for the Parcel project 2012. \r\nAnd moving on to EXPRESS. The division continued to perform very well in Q4. Revenues were significantly affected by currency movement and to a lesser extent, by smaller divestitures. Organic revenue growth was close to 6%. EBIT increased by over 14% and the operating margin increased by 120 basis points to 9.6% in Q4. And the primary drivers for the improvement are continued strong TDI volume growth, driving scale benefits, as well as the efficiency benefits enabled by investments in the ground and air network over the last years. Cash flow was very strong with an increase of 19% compared to last year. \r\nAnd moving now to Global FORWARDING and FREIGHT. They really have continued to be affected by trends that we've seen in previous quarters. Revenue declined due to continued weak volume trends, driven by an overall weak market environment and a particular impact on us due to our sector and customer mix. With our leadership position in airfreight, we've been especially affected by structural changes causing down trading in technology or modal shift in technology and a weak engineering and manufacturing sector. \r\nIn addition, our road freight business is largely concentrated in Europe, where the economy has been comparatively softer compared to other regions. And of course, we're implementing the comprehensive change initiative called NFE amid these weak market conditions. And in Q4, we spent more than in previous quarters on NFE implementation. \r\nIn recent months, we've seen signs of recovery in volumes, though the trend in gross profit margins remains challenging. And last but not least, SUPPLY CHAIN, on the next page, the SUPPLY CHAIN division continues to perform well, benefiting from a strong trend in new business generation and the accompanying benefits from a continuously improving contract mix that we're able, as a result, to achieve. EBIT benefited from net positive onetime effects in Q4 of around EUR 30 million, but nevertheless, increased by around 28% even without that effect. For the full year, positive and negative onetime effects for the division, just about fully offset each other, so that the improvement for the full year was around 5%, with an increase in EBIT margin from 2.9% to 3.1%. Cash flow was very strong in Q4, with the biggest contributor being a reduction in working capital.\r\nAnd wrapping up on the last page of the presentation. MAIL EBIT has clearly been stabilized above EUR 1 billion, our longtime target in strategy 2015. We've made further progress on DHL profitability improvement with strong improvement in EXPRESS. We had a very strong 2013 cash flow performance. However, with the mentioned timing effects, and we confirm again our 2015 group guidance. Please remember to save the date for our Capital Markets Day on April 2nd in Frankfurt. We'll be very pleased if you're able to join us. And now, we will be happy to answer any questions you might have.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Martin Ziegenbalg (Executives)】\nThanks, Frank, thanks, Larry. And operator, if you could start the Q&A sequence, please.",
      "transcript_text3": "Just 3 quick ones. In terms of the guidance in 2014, 2.9% to 3.1%, it's part of normal, the range. But I'm just wondering, it's a bit narrower than 2013. Are you seeing any improvement in terms of the visibility you can see in some of the markets, which ables you to more accurately indicate on earnings. The second question, I was just wondering, in terms of free cash flow, obviously, it was very good in 2013 there was some timing benefits. I'm just wondering, you're seeing, again in 2014, as you look at capital structure and maybe some or whether you are seeing any upward pressure on the rating. I see obviously, you've increased CapEx a little bit. And then the final question, I just was wondering about the way you've moved to shift the foreign domestic parcels from DHL to MAIL. Is that more -- do you see maybe more with e-commerce, let's say, wider ambition in the MAIL Parcel's business or just more tightening OpEx to size, where the EXPRESS business really is focusing on TDI? That will be great.\n\n---\n\nSteve, let me answer the first, Larry will answer the second, and I'll take the third as well. So the guidance, I think, you should not read something into that. That is now somehow different. I think, we are -- the EUR 200 million range, I think, it's a pretty good range and we feel comfortable with that at the current stage. And I think, you should not read -- last year, we had EUR 250 million as a range. I think and before we had EUR 200 million as well. I think, there is no fundamental change and having more certainty. I think EUR 200 million, that's 10% or less than 10% of the total. I think that's still a very, very solid and good range. On parcel, domestic and other countries. So first of all, of course, that's a decision from the board that we want to have EXPRESS to be more focusing on what they are best at, and have seen tremendous capabilities in MAIL. And therefore, we move the business to the place where it fits the best. I would like to say we will have a Capital Markets Day very soon anyway, and we would like to share a little bit more and what we can do with some of these activities going forward, and I would refrain from doing that today. Larry, may you answer the second question.\n\n---\n\nSo let me take the second question in terms of reading pressure. So I won't try to forecast whether or not we might get an upgrade, but would only note that Moody's has had us on positive outlook, now for more than 12 months. They typically, if I understand correctly, like to make a decision within 12 to 18 months at the latest, in terms of changing the rating. So we might expect some action soon, either moving us back to neutral or upgrading us. Certainly with the very strong cash flow and the improvement in credit ratios that we've seen. For example, our funds from operation to debt moved up to almost 35% at the end of the year. Certainly, the entire leverage and balance sheet relationship is moving in a positive direction from a credit point of view.\n\n---\n\nIf I could ask 2 questions, please. The first one is simple one on EXPRESS. Obviously, TDI volume growth of 8% in 2013 was impressive. And in simple terms. I guess, we're becoming a little bit more positive on the macro-ish. Does that suggest that you can at least maintain that volume growth rate in 2014, or should we be thinking about maybe some competitive pressures making that challenging? And then the second question, just on MAIL. Frank, you mentioned again the business is growing from a top line perspective, which is reassuring. But the fact that the underlying MAIL EBIT is suffering even modestly warrants renewed efforts to cut cost, so how do you think about the cost structure within MAIL currently?\n\n---\n\nYes. So I would not give a guidance for the volume growth this year, but you're right that we have no reason to believe that there will be more intense competition. I think, the industry has been very smart in competing on service quality instead of on price, and we have seen there last 5 years always, and we hope that this will continue. And therefore, we are remaining positive on the potential of growing with the market and even outperforming the market because the service quality is just outstanding. And some of our competitors also have other big challenges in their U.S. domestic market or have just changed the direction a little bit, talking about TNT. So we are very confident that we can continue to grow, but we usually don't give any number with regard to volume growth. But we have no reason to believe that the fate is changing pretty rapidly. On MAIL, yes, there is a challenge. We are working, of course, and we are not ready yet to disclose what kind of actions we can take. We told you several times that productivity reserves are getting smaller. I think, we need to find some new answers and we are working with those. But I think it's too early to disclose them and, of course, we need some discussions once in a while with the unions as well. We have a -- the seller reconditions are fixed until summer next year from the last negotiations, so we will not have missed that negotiations soon. We have -- before the problem, we haven't seen any growth in distribution. Now we see growth and, of course, the ambition in our commitment is that we convert it in more profit going forward. Despite that at the moment, we want to stick to our guidance of at least EUR 1.1 billion next year. But nevertheless, there is an opportunity. We see that as opportunity, we are -- that makes us very confident that we can deliver the EUR 1.1 billion, but the goal has to be that we improve that on the gearing on additional revenue to profit is definitely what we have to achieve. But as I said, negotiations will only be next year more than this year.\n\n---\n\nTwo set of questionnaires and one just a little clarity please. First on the EXPRESS business, somewhere back in September in Leipzig. Ken was talking about all 220 countries converting on the same IT platform for this year. Given the targets you had on pickup and delivery and unit cost savings for 2013. First of all, did you achieve them? And then secondly, what is the incremental effect that you'd be thinking about for 2014 on that IT convergence and what one would expect probable productivity uplift that will come from that? On the FREIGHT FORWARDING side, could you tell us about how you think of the trade-off between pricing and volumes? Where's the tipping point, where you have to start focusing on market share to assure your purchasing power in that business? And as you do that, can you give some updates from where you are in the NFE program. What's gone on beyond the rollout in New Zealand, and what was the cost delta for the year with the NFE? And very finally, I'm sorry for the questions, the 20% tax rate for 2014, is that now a sustainable tax rate going forward, or will that drop as you exhaust the tax losses?\n\n---\n\nYes. So we actually made good progress in EXPRESS and maybe, Larry, you talk about the cross-debt on air fee and the tax rate and we will cover the [indiscernible]. So in EXPRESS, we made good progress and we have seen the improvements, I think, Ken has envisioned in the last year. We definitely see additional benefits and as you know, we are shooting for next year of the margin of 10%, which we have not achieved yet and therefore, we will expect additional operational benefits from that and we are making very solid progress. So otherwise, it had not been impossible to achieve all these improvements. So yes, we are making good progress and we continue to do these things in this year. Price volume, yes. So the situation in FORWARDING is quite challenging anyway because, of course, the market is not very strong. We understand that we have to -- those volumes as well. They are good recent wins of which will kick in later this year -- no, wins in the last quarter. You only see that with at least 3 to 6 months delay, but we're optimistic that we'll see some good development because we have won some additional business as we believe. And of course, we have a tremendous focus on NFE at the moment. And as we have learned from our external orientation in the last year, that gives us tremendous opportunities in MAIL, SUPPLY CHAIN and EXPRESS, but also on the other side, if we are honest, we have certain distraction as well and you have seen that in some of the numbers last year. And you kind of want that. If you have such a massive transformation and we will continue to do so. With good progress, we have learned quite a lot from this New Zealand pilot. We will do an additional pilot very soon for some other countries, but we are confident that we found the right software. It's well developed and we can continue. But nevertheless, it's still an internal challenge to a certain extent. But as I've said, we have seen some encouraging wins in the last weeks. So overall, we believe that we have found the right balance between price and volume, and as I said will remain a challenge. And Larry, maybe you can comment on the NFE cost and the tax rate.\n\n---\n\nYes. So the delta on NFE expenditures in the P&L was around EUR 20 million for 2013 compared to 2012. Most of that delta came in Q4, so up till Q3, we were pretty much on the prior year level. So most of it came in Q4. Now, in terms of the sustainable tax rate, that's a good question. We have to start with the realization that our natural tax rate, if we don't have any other benefits or disadvantages, is somewhere in the mid-20%, 26%, 27%. We're forecasting 20%, again in 2014 because we believe that we'll be able to further activate tax loss carryforwards that we haven't yet been able to do. And also due to other optimization initiatives that we have on the board, but have not yet been implemented. So I think that in the short to midterm that we could expect for those two reasons that the tax rate will stay below our natural rate of 25% to 26%. How far below, I don't want to forecast yet, except for 2014, where we forecast 20%.\n\n---\n\nThree questions, if I may, please. Firstly, within the EBIT in EXPRESS in Q4, could you help and quantify what the impact of FX was, please, in EXPRESS in Q4? Secondly, just rolling on from the NFE discussions, when are you expecting that program to be fully implemented? And is an incremental EUR 20 million of cost into '14 a sort of good starting point? And then finally, in terms of SUPPLY CHAIN, you've done some restructuring in SUPPLY CHAIN, a lot of it coming in Q4. Is that European-related? And are you done on that front, or are there more restructuring cost to come?\n\n---\n\nI think, Larry, you might answer the 2 first questions, and I'll answer the third.\n\n---\n\nYes. So for competitive reasons, I don't want to disclose an FX impact at the EBIT level for individual divisions. What I'll say is that for the whole company, we're talking about a high double-digit millions amount for the full year, and most of that impact came in the second half, in particular, as we saw weakening emerging market currencies. So I'll let you draw your conclusions about how much that may affect EXPRESS. Obviously, EXPRESS is most exposed to emerging markets, so there was a significant effect for EXPRESS. But I don't want to exactly quantify it for competitive reasons. So we do expect 2014 to be the peak year of spending for NFE with a similar kind of increase in '14 over '13 as we saw in '13 over '12. The spending and the project implementation should largely be done by around mid-2015. And so we should already start to see some small benefits this year and bigger benefits in 2015.\n\n---\n\nYes. And in SUPPLY CHAIN, the restructuring provisions are mainly related to Europe, that's true. We think we can make still the -- particularly, the overhead leaner. And we would like to do that, and that's the reason why we said we have to continue to do that. It's small in individual countries, but of course, collectively, it's an amount which we have told you and -- but we don't see any additional needs at the current stage. And therefore, I think that is now fully reflecting what we plan to do for this year.\n\n---\n\nJust a couple of things for myself, please. Firstly, I think, with what we had -- thanks very much for the answer for the last question on FX. My other question on that was assuming that FX rates stay roughly where they are, I think the implication is you'll see a similar headwind in the first half of this year as you saw in the second half of last year. Or can you maybe sort of clarify that just to sort of be clear on it? And then the second question is on MAIL. Can you just discuss maybe some of the main regulatory issues that are outstanding at the moment? And what sort of things are going on in the market? So what I mean is things like what's going on with the De-Mail versus your own E-Postbrief and maybe if there are any signs that the German government is sort of encouraging people to move towards more online and -- online invoicing, et cetera, whether there's any sort of secular signs that you should be more concerned about less amount of volume declines than you have been in the last few years.\n\n---\n\nSo let me take the first question. Indeed, because currencies, in particular, emerging market currencies weakened over the course of the year, in particular, in the second half, there is indeed some headwind, especially in the first half of this year, though, it would not be similar in nature or in size as the effect that we saw last year. So it'll be a smaller effect. It will be a headwind, but a smaller effect we expect if currencies stay where they are than what we saw for the full year last year and, certainly, the second [ph] half.\n\n---\n\nYes. If we're talking about regulatory issues, I think they are the old known ones like the stated discussion, which is important at the moment. We don't expect a ruling this year. But potentially, next year, we are very confident that the decision will be in our favor, and that's the reason why we put them as well in the risk as a contingent liability, but not as if we have not build provisions, as you know. We have an ongoing antitrust topic, which is that we have -- the antitrust -- or competitors complained that we have done something, which is giving more rebates than we would be allowed to our customers. We are very confident that we followed the law very precisely. We don't know the outcome. We are confident that we made it right, but we can't exclude -- as we said at the annual report, we never can exclude that antitrust [indiscernible] as markets saw differently, but we think we are well positioned. And with regard to the postal law, after the change in the government, we don't expect any challenge of that law any longer. And the liberals, who are not in the parliament any longer, have challenged that in the last period. We don't expect that this will continue, so we see not really many challenges. This postage regime is now ruled for 5 years. We are now in the first one of that there, we think we are in predictable circumstances as well. With regard to De-Mail and our E-Post, as I said already, we have made, last year, EUR 100 million revenue. I think our competitors are far behind us. The reason is that because we have really created around the real translation of the physical referent to the Internet with confidentiality. We have put additional services around that, and we see now that B2B and B2C customers are buying that. A good hunting field for us is midsized and smaller customers are using a business box to direct their whole outbound mail through our system, and we will print them out and envelope them and deliver all end to end electronically. Our competitors can't provide that product because the De-Mail is not allowed to be used for hybrid mail. So we don't see really a challenge of our product to them. And our own experience is that the pure transfer of the letter into the Internet is not sufficient to get traction in the market. So we are well positioned, and the reason why we increased our revenue from EUR 20 million to EUR 100 million last year is the result of adding additional features to that product. And therefore, we are very confident that we will benefit, even if there are some push from the government, which is not expected at the moment. If there is more debate about confidentiality, I think we would have a very good product available to help customers and consumers in Germany. And that's the reason why we feel very confident with our strategy, and we are very happy with the progress we have seen and don't see De-Mail as a particular threat for us.\n\n---\n\nTwo, if I may. Firstly, following up a little bit on Damian's question, I'm struggling to understand a little bit of the FORWARDING developments here. When I look at your peers, they're all at better volumes, but also better gross profit trends in FORWARDING. And it looks, from an outside view, that you're losing market share despite being more or less aggressive on price. I'm wondering what you'd do to fix that. You alluded to some business wins, maybe you can expand on that a little bit. So is there anything changing in your push to the market over the past couple of weeks that would give us more confidence that you'll actually start to grow the business again also from a gross profit perspective? And the second one is a technicality, basically, on Page 23, you have a bridge for the net debt development at EUR 370 million. Are there effects from net debt 2012 to net debt to 2013? Could you elaborate what these are?\n\n---\n\nYes. May I take the first one? So we are definitely more disadvantaged than some of our competitors due to our massive footprint in Air Freight, and the trend has continued down-trading to Ocean or up-trading to EXPRESS as much as we benefited to that through the EXPRESS business somehow. We have a challenge in the balance. We also have, by far, the largest exposure to the tech market, and the tech market has lighter devices. And they are transporting significantly more in Ocean than they did in the past in the outstanding performing companies, and that hurts us more than some competitors. As I've said, we have seen some nice wins in several areas, in particular, also by the smaller and midsized customers. We are and have been more exposed to the large customers. Roger Crook has changed that already a while ago that strategy, that we are focusing more on the large customer than on the small or midsized. But the impact is relatively small. It takes time to build that up. We had some customers where we lost more than EUR 100 million revenue before 1 customer in this area because some of them have down-traded quite a bit. And if you have a big share of wallet, you, of course, are dependent on that as well. So it is a journey. It doesn't change overnight. All the indicators are showing at the moment with regard to volume and wins, winning also small and midsized in the right direction. But it will take some time until that is visible in our numbers, I'm afraid to say.\n\n---\n\nSo basically, you would say, it's all exogenous factors and nothing to do with your service levels or client approach?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think the service level is not the challenge. I think it's really -- it's not the external factors because our customer base is as the customer base is. And of course, if we are more dependent and have been very successful with the large customers and they are down-trading, I would not call that external factors that just -- I think the strategy to move to more midsized and smaller customer is the right one. But if you lose with 1 customer EUR 100 million revenue, you need a lot of small and midsized customers to compensate for that. And therefore, we have overlapping curve somehow, and some of them are showing in the right direction, others are still challenged by our export. And the newer manufacturers in our area, agriculture and construction, road construction has not been very strong last year. Some of these customers have faced, significantly, challenges as well. So we are a little bit of weak to have a strong position in the Air Freight. And that, you have seen for the whole year. The reason why we have changed strategy as well to focus more in small and midsize is that because we recognized or what we have recognized already a while ago. On top of everything, of course, there is a challenge by making the organization different and implementing a new system that takes time away as well. So therefore, we said that already, 2013 and '14 won't be the easiest years. We have, unfortunately, not the benefit of having a very strong economy at the moment where the fundamental trends are changing and that's a reason why this business will be more challenged than the other 3 divisions, I think, also in 2014.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Your second question was, what's in the EUR 370 million? The biggest items are net interest paid at about EUR 120 million. We have put the incurrence of finance lease liabilities in the amount of about EUR 110 million in that group. We also have FX impacts of around EUR 42 million, and then we have some effects from buying out minority partners in joint ventures, which we didn't include in M&A because we were already consolidating those entities, but rather included here. So those were the major points or major things that make up the EUR 370 million.\n\n---\n\nI just got three questions. Actually, I think I'll start off with just a very general question on your 2014 and 2015 guidance. I mean, if you look broadly, you're sort of talking about adding EUR 500 million to get to the bottom end of your 2015 range in terms of EBIT. Given that sort of growth requirement, are we now into the realms where you need the economy to move in your favor to actually propel you to that target, or can you -- are you still confident you can reach that target, even if the economy doesn't pick up? Because I think if we look at sort of the underlying EBIT growth trends the last couple years, you haven't really reached a growth rate that's anywhere near close enough to get you to that 2015 target. So I was just keen to understand your confidence in that. That's my first question. My second question is just, again, on the freight forwarding. I was just wondering if you could comment also on the Ocean Freight side because, obviously, you also are losing market share, and you're seeing some GP pressure there. So keen to understand really what you can do sort of reverse that, and whether, again, you intend to, over the longer term, focus on regaining market share and improving GP and your strategy to do that? And then finally, just in terms of the fourth quarter margin in MAIL just to understand what's happened there because I know you mentioned, obviously, staff cost. But if we look at the MAIL P&L, it looks like staff cost, were actually down slightly compared to Q4 2012. So just wondering what other moving parts are going on within the cost base there?\n\n---\n\nYes. Let me start with the confidence for 2015. Yes, we are still confident that we can make it despite that when we gave the guidance to the market, of course, we have not anticipated such a long period with very little growth, and we have also not anticipated such a strong headwind from currencies. But at the moment, we believe still that we can make them. Why we believe that? Because of course, they are still significant cost of NFE, which should be much more than next year already, and that should help quite a bit. We are also confident that we can improve the margin in the EXPRESS business on a higher base than we have in a couple of years ago, up to 10%, which should deliver significant lift as well. And we see now as well EUR 100 million more in the MAIL division as well than we have guided for. So we believe that this is still doable. Of course, we would wish to, or we would hope that the economy and currencies will not be further deteriorating, and we will only be able see that in the next couple of months. And at the current stage, we are confident that we can still deliver the guidance as we have given that. Despite that, you are right, the lift on the guidance we gave you for this year and for next year. But as I said, we have a significant expectation there, and we will be able see a good trend that's diminishing across the NFE and as well in EXPRESS continuing to improve the margin. Ocean Freight, as I said, the strategy is exactly the right synergy. We have to continue to focus more on small and midsized customers, and we are doing that already. And the second is we always said we need a new -- we need more processes, which are state-of-the-art and better than all our competitors, instead of working with old-fashion processes, and that's the reason why we have started the journey with NFE. So I wish that we see already some impact of that. But probably, the full impact of that is only visible if we really have NFE deployed. And then we see the benefits of having much more synergized processes and the opportunity to take cost out. So there will be no miracle, but everything will be fantastic tomorrow. It will be, as I said already twice, there will be a challenge. I think all indicators we see with the win of new business, scale of the business is heading in the right direction. But nevertheless, we have also, at the same time, the confirmation, and we will not change that now because we have seen in the last quarter some challenges with our profitability. I think it's right, the right synergy. The focus is right. And ultimately, we're doing the right stuff. But it will take some time. And therefore, as I said, probably even Tobias asked, we will have still a continuous challenge in 2014, but we're optimistic that we can make a significant step after the implementation of NFE next year. And maybe the last, you answer with regard to the margin in MAIL.\n\n---\n\nYes. And in particular, the development on labor cost. So the cost breakdown that we provide in the IR stat book is helpful, but doesn't always tell the whole story on the face of it. If you just look at staff cost, we really mean, by that line, our own staff cost, so employees of Deutsche Post DHL. When we hire temporary employees or contract or agency employees, which we do to a pretty large extent, especially during the high season period in Q4, those costs are going into the line above it, which is purchased goods and services. So you have to kind of look at those 2 lines together, and you see the significant increase in that purchased goods and services. And most of that increase is actually labor-related. We also had pretty high absenteeism or sickness rates, especially in the second half of the year. And so we hired some temporary staff to fill in for the higher-than-expected sick rate. So you really have to look at those 2 together.\n\n---\n\nLet me just make one quick follow-up just with regards to your CapEx guidance, your EUR 1.9 billion. Just keen to understand where the incremental spend will be focused, in particular, this year. And I think, a couple of years ago, you were saying that you would expect EUR 1.7 billion to have been the peak. And obviously, that's not the case. So keen to understand also a little bit more why that's changed.\n\n---\n\nYes. I think, to some extent, we're victims of our own success in that we've now on a sustained basis been achieving very high growth rates in especially the Parcel business and also the EXPRESS business. And those are the 2 most capital-intensive businesses that we have. So we view it, actually, rather positively that we're able to find really good attractive investments to improve our position in those 2 businesses even more. Those are the key drivers of the increase, and they're simply the identification of additional opportunities that we have both in the EXPRESS network and ongoing increases in Parcel capacity and automation that we think are going to drive further great performance in the future.\n\n---\n\nFirst of all, just want to confirm for the Leipzig Hub expansion CapEx, did I understood correctly from the slides that EUR 300 million is the amount that has already been invested, and there is another EUR 150 million coming for this project? And how long will this project complete, please? And then the next question is on EXPRESS revenue per shipment. So the -- almost the flattish year-on-year development for the TDI segment, that seems to be an improvement comparing to the previous quarters, especially when we consider the FX headwind. Could you maybe comment a little bit on the underlying trend? Do you indeed see an improvement in the yield environment?\n\n---\n\nYes. May I take the second question and start with that? And then Larry, you talk about the Leipzig, the CapEx there. So yes, we see improvement in yields in EXPRESS, which is quite encouraging. And I said already that the whole industry behaves very rational instead of irrational, and I think what you are saying is right, there is the trend in the right direction. I think it's too early to say that this is a sustainable trend because we never know. But overall, the yield has improved or, at least, stabilized instead of deteriorating over time. That's definitely the case.\n\n---\n\nYes. So the Leipzig Hub investments are, as you said, the EUR 300 million are investments that we've already made historically and EUR 150 million is what we're spending on this expansion. The expansion will be completed in the course of 2015.\n\n---\n\nSo if that's the case, then how should we think about the phasing of that EUR 150 million? Is that more front-end loaded into 2014?\n\n---\n\nI think a big part of it will be in '14 with some -- with the remainder in '15.\n\n---\n\nTwo questions from my side as most of my original questions have been asked already. The first, just to come back on the comment you made regarding -- I appreciate the guidance for the gross CapEx is out there for '14. But I think when you were talking about the cash flow, Larry, in the Q4, that you were talking about this sort of transitory CapEx that was going to kick into the cash flow for, I'm gathering, maybe the first quarter of this year in terms of outflows that were maybe a bit delayed. I mean, how should we think about the cash flow CapEx in 2014? Is the gross number of EUR 1.9 billion supposed to incorporate the timing effects as well, or will, actually, the outflows be higher than that?\n\n---\n\nNow the EUR 1.9 billion is the accounting amount of CapEx that we expect to book in 2014, and it's the gross amount, there's always an amount somewhere around EUR 200 million to EUR 250 million, maybe at a peak, EUR 300 million of assets that we sell every year. And of course, you have to net that for the whole cash impact. We would expect, as in most years, that a part, maybe a smaller part of the EUR 1.9 billion will be deferred into the following year. I think 2013 was somewhat exceptional insofar as we had a pretty big deferral or a bigger-than-usual deferral of spending, i.e. cash outflow compared to the accounting CapEx figure. Does that help? Does it answer your question?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, I guess it was just to sort of provide a bit of context that, say, your EBIT guidance as a starting point is sort of flattish to going to be up EUR 200 million and when you deliver the EUR 1.6 billion of kind of free cash this year with a slight increase in your accounting CapEx guidance that we would take into account. I mean, should we suddenly assume a much bigger potential drop in the free cash generation because of CapEx timing, or at the end of the day, that should probably wash out and maybe there is a bit of deferral into '15?\n\n---\n\nSo again, we think -- we try to quantify what we call the transitory effect for the amount of cash deferral that was cash positive in '13 that we expect to flow back out in '14 as between EUR 300 million to EUR 400 million, right? So if you take that off of the top of the 2013 cash flow generation and then you add your assumption about EBIT growth and then subtract the minor increase in CapEx spending, then you kind of get to where your forecast would be for free cash flow in '14.\n\n---\n\nOkay. That is helpful. And my second question, coming back to supply chain. When we think about sort of modeling it now into 2014, assuming there doesn't need to be anymore European restructuring, maybe no other positive one-offs, how should we think about the sort of quarterly margin that -- is it something that could now reset to up a higher level instead of being hovering at sort of the low 2% until the Q4 with the benefit of the one-off? How should we think about that sort of contribution on a quarterly basis in '14?\n\n---\n\nI think we will see the same development in the past. Due to the situation that you saw in 3- to 5-year contracts, you always have a significant dilution of the better new business through the old one. And therefore, you will not see such a rapid evolution of the margins as you have seen there in the EXPRESS business in the last year. So I think you should not be surprised. We will see a positive trend. That's our expectation for this year again. But it takes time, unfortunately, because if we sign a contract for a couple of years, you can't change too much and during the course of the contracts, and that's the reason why if we mark and if we make 2 percentage points on balance, that's quite significant statement, if you mix and match the old with the new business. And therefore, we should see continuation of that. And of course, now with the new person, I think we should give him as well some time, despite that he has been, of course, engaged very much in those, in the discussion of the next steps, anyway, before he will communicates more of what he want to do in addition to what we are doing at the moment.\n\n---\n\nJust one question remaining from my side, please. Just regarding cash payout to shareholders. Given that the free cash flow performance during 2013 was so strong at around EUR 700 million more than you'll need to cover the post-ordinary dividend, could you tell us whether any additional cash return to shareholders beyond the ordinary dividend was considered, for instance, through a special dividend or a share buyback? And in general, could you maybe provide some color on the circumstances that you would need to see for a special dividend or share buyback to be considered in the future?\n\n---\n\nYes. Thanks, Robert. So 2013, we think of as an excellent year for cash flow performance. It was accentuated by the transitory effects that we talked about, so maybe the excess wasn't as great as it initially appears. We do expect, as we talked about on Penny's question, that 2014 is also going to be quite a good year, and we'll, at least, be able to cover the now higher dividend, and even taking into account those mentioned timing effects from 2013. So in 2015, I would say we would see as the time where we would generate then significant excess free cash flow and also have potentially higher credit ratings. So we don't want to forecast when and whether the rating agencies are going to upgrade us. But we think if we stay on the current trajectory, we certainly have chances for higher ratings. But I think, right now, it's just too early to decide in line with our finance policy how the potential excess cash flow will be deployed and whether it's to further pension funding or to shareholder distributions. And then if it's the latter, in which form? It's just probably too early, at this point, to make a forecast about that.\n\n---\n\nYes. And let me add one thing, which is not different from what Larry have just said, but to remind you, I said a couple of quarters ago that after we have fixed our problems, we have focused to earn the cost of capital, the next step is focus on cash flow. That was in the second half of 2012. And the impact of the organization is deliver very carefully, which is tremendous. So as I always said, let's make the money first before we talk about what we should do with the money. And I think what we have seen is good progress, that our executives are more incentives as well on cash flow has paid off, and that is good news. But we have to work hard again to continue to generate a significant free cash flow. And therefore, I would second what Larry just said. I think let's see that we continue to work hard on that, and then we will see what we want to do with the money. But I can reassure you, we have no major plans to make bold acquisitions whatsoever. We will remain to optimize our operations and grow at excellent speed organically. That's our goal and not to make any major acquisitions going forward.\n\n---\n\nI guess, as we're getting close to the end, I'll just ask one. On KfW, I think they still own about 21% of the company. Do you have any sense given the share price recovery that the federal government or KfW might be sellers?\n\n---\n\nSo that is a secret for me as well. Unfortunately, that's a secret as well for me because if it would not be and I would be in a difficult -- what I think -- the current government is definitely a different one than the previous one where the liberals always said, \"Sell the shares down of state on enterprises.\" And that's the reason why the last tranche rate sold about between EUR 15 and EUR 16 just a while ago. We don't know if they really plan to sell down further, and we will learn that in due course as well. It's a political decision. You have seen that the German government is planning to have no budget deficit next year, so they would just do it out of political reasons. I think they still get a very good return on their investment from the dividend. It's also, for them, tax-free, I guess. So they are German shareholders. So we don't know, actually, Robin. We don't know, and we feel happy with them. I think they had not hindered us in any way to do right and tedious decisions for the company, and they have supported that very much as well. And therefore, we just have to wait what their political decision on that subject is. But with the liberals not in the government, I think the likelihood that they continue rapidly is smaller than it had been when the liberals were a part of the government, I would guess.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Well, thanks, Robin, for being so mindful of our time and being so crisp. So I think we've got one last caller that we could take care of.\n\n---\n\nTwo questions, if I may. First one is on the DHL target for '15. At the previous Capital Markets Day, you said that the growth that you saw for the DHL operations would also apply to each of the 3 decisions there. Do you still have confidence that all of these 3 decisions will meet the targets on a separate basis? Second question is, in a previous occasion, so you said that EXPRESS made market share gains in all regions, so would that also be applicable for Q4?\n\n---\n\nSo let me answer the second question. Larry will comment on more of the numbers. So we don't know yet because we have no market intelligence on the last quarter. So therefore, we can't just say if that's the case. We believe that our growth we have seen in the fourth quarter is partially driven by market share gain, looking into what our competitors have reported. But since we have not done any survey, that's more indirect evidence by seeing what their growth rate has been and ours. And ours has been another quarter above what our competitors have seen [ph]. So I would say, I think we have gained market share and not different from probably, for now, 2.5, 3 years in a row, but we have no really hard figures to support that except the volume growth of our competitors.\n\n---\n\nSo on the 2015 guidance, we, again, today, have confirmed the guidance in all respects. Just pointing out that we've made an adjustment for the shift of some smaller domestic parcel businesses from the DHL side to the MAIL side, and we've decreased DHL to account for that and increased MAIL by exactly the same amount. So overall, the guidance is not changed nor are any of the underlying components.\n\n---\n\nOperator, are there any further callers out there?\n\n---\n\nOkay. So at least we can stick to our little schedule very well. Thank you out there very much for taking the time. We're looking forward to seeing at least some of you over the next couple of days when we do our roadshowing activities. And of course, we're looking forward to seeing you on our Capital Markets Day. A detailed invite will go out in the nearer future, obviously. And before closing, I just want to hand over to Frank for some concluding remarks.\n\n---\n\nYes. So to summarize the call, we are satisfied with the last year's numbers. We have met most of our guidances or some of them. We slightly outperformed on free cash flow. We outperformed them probably quite strongly. We explained why that is the case. We are satisfied with 2013. I think we have clear goals as well for 2014 and remain confident that we can make the guidance for next year. As I've said at the beginning, it still remains hard work because the economy doesn't have too much, and foreign exchange doesn't have either. So the goal is challenging. But as I've said, we are confident to make it happen. So -- and with that, I would like to thank you for joining us this afternoon and for all the nice questions and good questions you had. And with that, we will see you soon at the Capital Markets Day, I guess, to talk a little bit more about what our plans going forward will be.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Stephen Furlong (Analysts)】\nJust 3 quick ones. In terms of the guidance in 2014, 2.9% to 3.1%, it's part of normal, the range. But I'm just wondering, it's a bit narrower than 2013. Are you seeing any improvement in terms of the visibility you can see in some of the markets, which ables you to more accurately indicate on earnings. The second question, I was just wondering, in terms of free cash flow, obviously, it was very good in 2013 there was some timing benefits. I'm just wondering, you're seeing, again in 2014, as you look at capital structure and maybe some or whether you are seeing any upward pressure on the rating. I see obviously, you've increased CapEx a little bit. And then the final question, I just was wondering about the way you've moved to shift the foreign domestic parcels from DHL to MAIL. Is that more -- do you see maybe more with e-commerce, let's say, wider ambition in the MAIL Parcel's business or just more tightening OpEx to size, where the EXPRESS business really is focusing on TDI? That will be great.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nSteve, let me answer the first, Larry will answer the second, and I'll take the third as well. So the guidance, I think, you should not read something into that. That is now somehow different. I think, we are -- the EUR 200 million range, I think, it's a pretty good range and we feel comfortable with that at the current stage. And I think, you should not read -- last year, we had EUR 250 million as a range. I think and before we had EUR 200 million as well. I think, there is no fundamental change and having more certainty. I think EUR 200 million, that's 10% or less than 10% of the total. I think that's still a very, very solid and good range. On parcel, domestic and other countries. So first of all, of course, that's a decision from the board that we want to have EXPRESS to be more focusing on what they are best at, and have seen tremendous capabilities in MAIL. And therefore, we move the business to the place where it fits the best. I would like to say we will have a Capital Markets Day very soon anyway, and we would like to share a little bit more and what we can do with some of these activities going forward, and I would refrain from doing that today. Larry, may you answer the second question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nSo let me take the second question in terms of reading pressure. So I won't try to forecast whether or not we might get an upgrade, but would only note that Moody's has had us on positive outlook, now for more than 12 months. They typically, if I understand correctly, like to make a decision within 12 to 18 months at the latest, in terms of changing the rating. So we might expect some action soon, either moving us back to neutral or upgrading us. Certainly with the very strong cash flow and the improvement in credit ratios that we've seen. For example, our funds from operation to debt moved up to almost 35% at the end of the year. Certainly, the entire leverage and balance sheet relationship is moving in a positive direction from a credit point of view.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Neil Glynn (Analysts)】\nIf I could ask 2 questions, please. The first one is simple one on EXPRESS. Obviously, TDI volume growth of 8% in 2013 was impressive. And in simple terms. I guess, we're becoming a little bit more positive on the macro-ish. Does that suggest that you can at least maintain that volume growth rate in 2014, or should we be thinking about maybe some competitive pressures making that challenging? And then the second question, just on MAIL. Frank, you mentioned again the business is growing from a top line perspective, which is reassuring. But the fact that the underlying MAIL EBIT is suffering even modestly warrants renewed efforts to cut cost, so how do you think about the cost structure within MAIL currently?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nYes. So I would not give a guidance for the volume growth this year, but you're right that we have no reason to believe that there will be more intense competition. I think, the industry has been very smart in competing on service quality instead of on price, and we have seen there last 5 years always, and we hope that this will continue. And therefore, we are remaining positive on the potential of growing with the market and even outperforming the market because the service quality is just outstanding. And some of our competitors also have other big challenges in their U.S. domestic market or have just changed the direction a little bit, talking about TNT. So we are very confident that we can continue to grow, but we usually don't give any number with regard to volume growth. But we have no reason to believe that the fate is changing pretty rapidly. On MAIL, yes, there is a challenge. We are working, of course, and we are not ready yet to disclose what kind of actions we can take. We told you several times that productivity reserves are getting smaller. I think, we need to find some new answers and we are working with those. But I think it's too early to disclose them and, of course, we need some discussions once in a while with the unions as well. We have a -- the seller reconditions are fixed until summer next year from the last negotiations, so we will not have missed that negotiations soon. We have -- before the problem, we haven't seen any growth in distribution. Now we see growth and, of course, the ambition in our commitment is that we convert it in more profit going forward. Despite that at the moment, we want to stick to our guidance of at least EUR 1.1 billion next year. But nevertheless, there is an opportunity. We see that as opportunity, we are -- that makes us very confident that we can deliver the EUR 1.1 billion, but the goal has to be that we improve that on the gearing on additional revenue to profit is definitely what we have to achieve. But as I said, negotiations will only be next year more than this year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Damian Brewer (Analysts)】\nTwo set of questionnaires and one just a little clarity please. First on the EXPRESS business, somewhere back in September in Leipzig. Ken was talking about all 220 countries converting on the same IT platform for this year. Given the targets you had on pickup and delivery and unit cost savings for 2013. First of all, did you achieve them? And then secondly, what is the incremental effect that you'd be thinking about for 2014 on that IT convergence and what one would expect probable productivity uplift that will come from that? On the FREIGHT FORWARDING side, could you tell us about how you think of the trade-off between pricing and volumes? Where's the tipping point, where you have to start focusing on market share to assure your purchasing power in that business? And as you do that, can you give some updates from where you are in the NFE program. What's gone on beyond the rollout in New Zealand, and what was the cost delta for the year with the NFE? And very finally, I'm sorry for the questions, the 20% tax rate for 2014, is that now a sustainable tax rate going forward, or will that drop as you exhaust the tax losses?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nYes. So we actually made good progress in EXPRESS and maybe, Larry, you talk about the cross-debt on air fee and the tax rate and we will cover the [indiscernible]. So in EXPRESS, we made good progress and we have seen the improvements, I think, Ken has envisioned in the last year. We definitely see additional benefits and as you know, we are shooting for next year of the margin of 10%, which we have not achieved yet and therefore, we will expect additional operational benefits from that and we are making very solid progress. So otherwise, it had not been impossible to achieve all these improvements. So yes, we are making good progress and we continue to do these things in this year. Price volume, yes. So the situation in FORWARDING is quite challenging anyway because, of course, the market is not very strong. We understand that we have to -- those volumes as well. They are good recent wins of which will kick in later this year -- no, wins in the last quarter. You only see that with at least 3 to 6 months delay, but we're optimistic that we'll see some good development because we have won some additional business as we believe. And of course, we have a tremendous focus on NFE at the moment. And as we have learned from our external orientation in the last year, that gives us tremendous opportunities in MAIL, SUPPLY CHAIN and EXPRESS, but also on the other side, if we are honest, we have certain distraction as well and you have seen that in some of the numbers last year. And you kind of want that. If you have such a massive transformation and we will continue to do so. With good progress, we have learned quite a lot from this New Zealand pilot. We will do an additional pilot very soon for some other countries, but we are confident that we found the right software. It's well developed and we can continue. But nevertheless, it's still an internal challenge to a certain extent. But as I've said, we have seen some encouraging wins in the last weeks. So overall, we believe that we have found the right balance between price and volume, and as I said will remain a challenge. And Larry, maybe you can comment on the NFE cost and the tax rate.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nYes. So the delta on NFE expenditures in the P&L was around EUR 20 million for 2013 compared to 2012. Most of that delta came in Q4, so up till Q3, we were pretty much on the prior year level. So most of it came in Q4. Now, in terms of the sustainable tax rate, that's a good question. We have to start with the realization that our natural tax rate, if we don't have any other benefits or disadvantages, is somewhere in the mid-20%, 26%, 27%. We're forecasting 20%, again in 2014 because we believe that we'll be able to further activate tax loss carryforwards that we haven't yet been able to do. And also due to other optimization initiatives that we have on the board, but have not yet been implemented. So I think that in the short to midterm that we could expect for those two reasons that the tax rate will stay below our natural rate of 25% to 26%. How far below, I don't want to forecast yet, except for 2014, where we forecast 20%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andy Chu (Analysts)】\nThree questions, if I may, please. Firstly, within the EBIT in EXPRESS in Q4, could you help and quantify what the impact of FX was, please, in EXPRESS in Q4? Secondly, just rolling on from the NFE discussions, when are you expecting that program to be fully implemented? And is an incremental EUR 20 million of cost into '14 a sort of good starting point? And then finally, in terms of SUPPLY CHAIN, you've done some restructuring in SUPPLY CHAIN, a lot of it coming in Q4. Is that European-related? And are you done on that front, or are there more restructuring cost to come?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nI think, Larry, you might answer the 2 first questions, and I'll answer the third.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nYes. So for competitive reasons, I don't want to disclose an FX impact at the EBIT level for individual divisions. What I'll say is that for the whole company, we're talking about a high double-digit millions amount for the full year, and most of that impact came in the second half, in particular, as we saw weakening emerging market currencies. So I'll let you draw your conclusions about how much that may affect EXPRESS. Obviously, EXPRESS is most exposed to emerging markets, so there was a significant effect for EXPRESS. But I don't want to exactly quantify it for competitive reasons. So we do expect 2014 to be the peak year of spending for NFE with a similar kind of increase in '14 over '13 as we saw in '13 over '12. The spending and the project implementation should largely be done by around mid-2015. And so we should already start to see some small benefits this year and bigger benefits in 2015.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nYes. And in SUPPLY CHAIN, the restructuring provisions are mainly related to Europe, that's true. We think we can make still the -- particularly, the overhead leaner. And we would like to do that, and that's the reason why we said we have to continue to do that. It's small in individual countries, but of course, collectively, it's an amount which we have told you and -- but we don't see any additional needs at the current stage. And therefore, I think that is now fully reflecting what we plan to do for this year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Dominic Edridge (Analysts)】\nJust a couple of things for myself, please. Firstly, I think, with what we had -- thanks very much for the answer for the last question on FX. My other question on that was assuming that FX rates stay roughly where they are, I think the implication is you'll see a similar headwind in the first half of this year as you saw in the second half of last year. Or can you maybe sort of clarify that just to sort of be clear on it? And then the second question is on MAIL. Can you just discuss maybe some of the main regulatory issues that are outstanding at the moment? And what sort of things are going on in the market? So what I mean is things like what's going on with the De-Mail versus your own E-Postbrief and maybe if there are any signs that the German government is sort of encouraging people to move towards more online and -- online invoicing, et cetera, whether there's any sort of secular signs that you should be more concerned about less amount of volume declines than you have been in the last few years.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nSo let me take the first question. Indeed, because currencies, in particular, emerging market currencies weakened over the course of the year, in particular, in the second half, there is indeed some headwind, especially in the first half of this year, though, it would not be similar in nature or in size as the effect that we saw last year. So it'll be a smaller effect. It will be a headwind, but a smaller effect we expect if currencies stay where they are than what we saw for the full year last year and, certainly, the second [ph] half.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nYes. If we're talking about regulatory issues, I think they are the old known ones like the stated discussion, which is important at the moment. We don't expect a ruling this year. But potentially, next year, we are very confident that the decision will be in our favor, and that's the reason why we put them as well in the risk as a contingent liability, but not as if we have not build provisions, as you know. We have an ongoing antitrust topic, which is that we have -- the antitrust -- or competitors complained that we have done something, which is giving more rebates than we would be allowed to our customers. We are very confident that we followed the law very precisely. We don't know the outcome. We are confident that we made it right, but we can't exclude -- as we said at the annual report, we never can exclude that antitrust [indiscernible] as markets saw differently, but we think we are well positioned. And with regard to the postal law, after the change in the government, we don't expect any challenge of that law any longer. And the liberals, who are not in the parliament any longer, have challenged that in the last period. We don't expect that this will continue, so we see not really many challenges. This postage regime is now ruled for 5 years. We are now in the first one of that there, we think we are in predictable circumstances as well. With regard to De-Mail and our E-Post, as I said already, we have made, last year, EUR 100 million revenue. I think our competitors are far behind us. The reason is that because we have really created around the real translation of the physical referent to the Internet with confidentiality. We have put additional services around that, and we see now that B2B and B2C customers are buying that. A good hunting field for us is midsized and smaller customers are using a business box to direct their whole outbound mail through our system, and we will print them out and envelope them and deliver all end to end electronically. Our competitors can't provide that product because the De-Mail is not allowed to be used for hybrid mail. So we don't see really a challenge of our product to them. And our own experience is that the pure transfer of the letter into the Internet is not sufficient to get traction in the market. So we are well positioned, and the reason why we increased our revenue from EUR 20 million to EUR 100 million last year is the result of adding additional features to that product. And therefore, we are very confident that we will benefit, even if there are some push from the government, which is not expected at the moment. If there is more debate about confidentiality, I think we would have a very good product available to help customers and consumers in Germany. And that's the reason why we feel very confident with our strategy, and we are very happy with the progress we have seen and don't see De-Mail as a particular threat for us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tobias Sittig (Analysts)】\nTwo, if I may. Firstly, following up a little bit on Damian's question, I'm struggling to understand a little bit of the FORWARDING developments here. When I look at your peers, they're all at better volumes, but also better gross profit trends in FORWARDING. And it looks, from an outside view, that you're losing market share despite being more or less aggressive on price. I'm wondering what you'd do to fix that. You alluded to some business wins, maybe you can expand on that a little bit. So is there anything changing in your push to the market over the past couple of weeks that would give us more confidence that you'll actually start to grow the business again also from a gross profit perspective? And the second one is a technicality, basically, on Page 23, you have a bridge for the net debt development at EUR 370 million. Are there effects from net debt 2012 to net debt to 2013? Could you elaborate what these are?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nYes. May I take the first one? So we are definitely more disadvantaged than some of our competitors due to our massive footprint in Air Freight, and the trend has continued down-trading to Ocean or up-trading to EXPRESS as much as we benefited to that through the EXPRESS business somehow. We have a challenge in the balance. We also have, by far, the largest exposure to the tech market, and the tech market has lighter devices. And they are transporting significantly more in Ocean than they did in the past in the outstanding performing companies, and that hurts us more than some competitors. As I've said, we have seen some nice wins in several areas, in particular, also by the smaller and midsized customers. We are and have been more exposed to the large customers. Roger Crook has changed that already a while ago that strategy, that we are focusing more on the large customer than on the small or midsized. But the impact is relatively small. It takes time to build that up. We had some customers where we lost more than EUR 100 million revenue before 1 customer in this area because some of them have down-traded quite a bit. And if you have a big share of wallet, you, of course, are dependent on that as well. So it is a journey. It doesn't change overnight. All the indicators are showing at the moment with regard to volume and wins, winning also small and midsized in the right direction. But it will take some time until that is visible in our numbers, I'm afraid to say.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tobias Sittig (Analysts)】\nSo basically, you would say, it's all exogenous factors and nothing to do with your service levels or client approach?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nWell, I think the service level is not the challenge. I think it's really -- it's not the external factors because our customer base is as the customer base is. And of course, if we are more dependent and have been very successful with the large customers and they are down-trading, I would not call that external factors that just -- I think the strategy to move to more midsized and smaller customer is the right one. But if you lose with 1 customer EUR 100 million revenue, you need a lot of small and midsized customers to compensate for that. And therefore, we have overlapping curve somehow, and some of them are showing in the right direction, others are still challenged by our export. And the newer manufacturers in our area, agriculture and construction, road construction has not been very strong last year. Some of these customers have faced, significantly, challenges as well. So we are a little bit of weak to have a strong position in the Air Freight. And that, you have seen for the whole year. The reason why we have changed strategy as well to focus more in small and midsize is that because we recognized or what we have recognized already a while ago. On top of everything, of course, there is a challenge by making the organization different and implementing a new system that takes time away as well. So therefore, we said that already, 2013 and '14 won't be the easiest years. We have, unfortunately, not the benefit of having a very strong economy at the moment where the fundamental trends are changing and that's a reason why this business will be more challenged than the other 3 divisions, I think, also in 2014.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nOkay. Your second question was, what's in the EUR 370 million? The biggest items are net interest paid at about EUR 120 million. We have put the incurrence of finance lease liabilities in the amount of about EUR 110 million in that group. We also have FX impacts of around EUR 42 million, and then we have some effects from buying out minority partners in joint ventures, which we didn't include in M&A because we were already consolidating those entities, but rather included here. So those were the major points or major things that make up the EUR 370 million.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joel Spungin (Analysts)】\nI just got three questions. Actually, I think I'll start off with just a very general question on your 2014 and 2015 guidance. I mean, if you look broadly, you're sort of talking about adding EUR 500 million to get to the bottom end of your 2015 range in terms of EBIT. Given that sort of growth requirement, are we now into the realms where you need the economy to move in your favor to actually propel you to that target, or can you -- are you still confident you can reach that target, even if the economy doesn't pick up? Because I think if we look at sort of the underlying EBIT growth trends the last couple years, you haven't really reached a growth rate that's anywhere near close enough to get you to that 2015 target. So I was just keen to understand your confidence in that. That's my first question. My second question is just, again, on the freight forwarding. I was just wondering if you could comment also on the Ocean Freight side because, obviously, you also are losing market share, and you're seeing some GP pressure there. So keen to understand really what you can do sort of reverse that, and whether, again, you intend to, over the longer term, focus on regaining market share and improving GP and your strategy to do that? And then finally, just in terms of the fourth quarter margin in MAIL just to understand what's happened there because I know you mentioned, obviously, staff cost. But if we look at the MAIL P&L, it looks like staff cost, were actually down slightly compared to Q4 2012. So just wondering what other moving parts are going on within the cost base there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nYes. Let me start with the confidence for 2015. Yes, we are still confident that we can make it despite that when we gave the guidance to the market, of course, we have not anticipated such a long period with very little growth, and we have also not anticipated such a strong headwind from currencies. But at the moment, we believe still that we can make them. Why we believe that? Because of course, they are still significant cost of NFE, which should be much more than next year already, and that should help quite a bit. We are also confident that we can improve the margin in the EXPRESS business on a higher base than we have in a couple of years ago, up to 10%, which should deliver significant lift as well. And we see now as well EUR 100 million more in the MAIL division as well than we have guided for. So we believe that this is still doable. Of course, we would wish to, or we would hope that the economy and currencies will not be further deteriorating, and we will only be able see that in the next couple of months. And at the current stage, we are confident that we can still deliver the guidance as we have given that. Despite that, you are right, the lift on the guidance we gave you for this year and for next year. But as I said, we have a significant expectation there, and we will be able see a good trend that's diminishing across the NFE and as well in EXPRESS continuing to improve the margin. Ocean Freight, as I said, the strategy is exactly the right synergy. We have to continue to focus more on small and midsized customers, and we are doing that already. And the second is we always said we need a new -- we need more processes, which are state-of-the-art and better than all our competitors, instead of working with old-fashion processes, and that's the reason why we have started the journey with NFE. So I wish that we see already some impact of that. But probably, the full impact of that is only visible if we really have NFE deployed. And then we see the benefits of having much more synergized processes and the opportunity to take cost out. So there will be no miracle, but everything will be fantastic tomorrow. It will be, as I said already twice, there will be a challenge. I think all indicators we see with the win of new business, scale of the business is heading in the right direction. But nevertheless, we have also, at the same time, the confirmation, and we will not change that now because we have seen in the last quarter some challenges with our profitability. I think it's right, the right synergy. The focus is right. And ultimately, we're doing the right stuff. But it will take some time. And therefore, as I said, probably even Tobias asked, we will have still a continuous challenge in 2014, but we're optimistic that we can make a significant step after the implementation of NFE next year. And maybe the last, you answer with regard to the margin in MAIL.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nYes. And in particular, the development on labor cost. So the cost breakdown that we provide in the IR stat book is helpful, but doesn't always tell the whole story on the face of it. If you just look at staff cost, we really mean, by that line, our own staff cost, so employees of Deutsche Post DHL. When we hire temporary employees or contract or agency employees, which we do to a pretty large extent, especially during the high season period in Q4, those costs are going into the line above it, which is purchased goods and services. So you have to kind of look at those 2 lines together, and you see the significant increase in that purchased goods and services. And most of that increase is actually labor-related. We also had pretty high absenteeism or sickness rates, especially in the second half of the year. And so we hired some temporary staff to fill in for the higher-than-expected sick rate. So you really have to look at those 2 together.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joel Spungin (Analysts)】\nLet me just make one quick follow-up just with regards to your CapEx guidance, your EUR 1.9 billion. Just keen to understand where the incremental spend will be focused, in particular, this year. And I think, a couple of years ago, you were saying that you would expect EUR 1.7 billion to have been the peak. And obviously, that's not the case. So keen to understand also a little bit more why that's changed.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nYes. I think, to some extent, we're victims of our own success in that we've now on a sustained basis been achieving very high growth rates in especially the Parcel business and also the EXPRESS business. And those are the 2 most capital-intensive businesses that we have. So we view it, actually, rather positively that we're able to find really good attractive investments to improve our position in those 2 businesses even more. Those are the key drivers of the increase, and they're simply the identification of additional opportunities that we have both in the EXPRESS network and ongoing increases in Parcel capacity and automation that we think are going to drive further great performance in the future.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Wenchang Ma (Analysts)】\nFirst of all, just want to confirm for the Leipzig Hub expansion CapEx, did I understood correctly from the slides that EUR 300 million is the amount that has already been invested, and there is another EUR 150 million coming for this project? And how long will this project complete, please? And then the next question is on EXPRESS revenue per shipment. So the -- almost the flattish year-on-year development for the TDI segment, that seems to be an improvement comparing to the previous quarters, especially when we consider the FX headwind. Could you maybe comment a little bit on the underlying trend? Do you indeed see an improvement in the yield environment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nYes. May I take the second question and start with that? And then Larry, you talk about the Leipzig, the CapEx there. So yes, we see improvement in yields in EXPRESS, which is quite encouraging. And I said already that the whole industry behaves very rational instead of irrational, and I think what you are saying is right, there is the trend in the right direction. I think it's too early to say that this is a sustainable trend because we never know. But overall, the yield has improved or, at least, stabilized instead of deteriorating over time. That's definitely the case.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nYes. So the Leipzig Hub investments are, as you said, the EUR 300 million are investments that we've already made historically and EUR 150 million is what we're spending on this expansion. The expansion will be completed in the course of 2015.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Wenchang Ma (Analysts)】\nSo if that's the case, then how should we think about the phasing of that EUR 150 million? Is that more front-end loaded into 2014?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nI think a big part of it will be in '14 with some -- with the remainder in '15.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Penelope Butcher (Analysts)】\nTwo questions from my side as most of my original questions have been asked already. The first, just to come back on the comment you made regarding -- I appreciate the guidance for the gross CapEx is out there for '14. But I think when you were talking about the cash flow, Larry, in the Q4, that you were talking about this sort of transitory CapEx that was going to kick into the cash flow for, I'm gathering, maybe the first quarter of this year in terms of outflows that were maybe a bit delayed. I mean, how should we think about the cash flow CapEx in 2014? Is the gross number of EUR 1.9 billion supposed to incorporate the timing effects as well, or will, actually, the outflows be higher than that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nNow the EUR 1.9 billion is the accounting amount of CapEx that we expect to book in 2014, and it's the gross amount, there's always an amount somewhere around EUR 200 million to EUR 250 million, maybe at a peak, EUR 300 million of assets that we sell every year. And of course, you have to net that for the whole cash impact. We would expect, as in most years, that a part, maybe a smaller part of the EUR 1.9 billion will be deferred into the following year. I think 2013 was somewhat exceptional insofar as we had a pretty big deferral or a bigger-than-usual deferral of spending, i.e. cash outflow compared to the accounting CapEx figure. Does that help? Does it answer your question?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Penelope Butcher (Analysts)】\nYes. I mean, I guess it was just to sort of provide a bit of context that, say, your EBIT guidance as a starting point is sort of flattish to going to be up EUR 200 million and when you deliver the EUR 1.6 billion of kind of free cash this year with a slight increase in your accounting CapEx guidance that we would take into account. I mean, should we suddenly assume a much bigger potential drop in the free cash generation because of CapEx timing, or at the end of the day, that should probably wash out and maybe there is a bit of deferral into '15?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nSo again, we think -- we try to quantify what we call the transitory effect for the amount of cash deferral that was cash positive in '13 that we expect to flow back out in '14 as between EUR 300 million to EUR 400 million, right? So if you take that off of the top of the 2013 cash flow generation and then you add your assumption about EBIT growth and then subtract the minor increase in CapEx spending, then you kind of get to where your forecast would be for free cash flow in '14.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Penelope Butcher (Analysts)】\nOkay. That is helpful. And my second question, coming back to supply chain. When we think about sort of modeling it now into 2014, assuming there doesn't need to be anymore European restructuring, maybe no other positive one-offs, how should we think about the sort of quarterly margin that -- is it something that could now reset to up a higher level instead of being hovering at sort of the low 2% until the Q4 with the benefit of the one-off? How should we think about that sort of contribution on a quarterly basis in '14?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nI think we will see the same development in the past. Due to the situation that you saw in 3- to 5-year contracts, you always have a significant dilution of the better new business through the old one. And therefore, you will not see such a rapid evolution of the margins as you have seen there in the EXPRESS business in the last year. So I think you should not be surprised. We will see a positive trend. That's our expectation for this year again. But it takes time, unfortunately, because if we sign a contract for a couple of years, you can't change too much and during the course of the contracts, and that's the reason why if we mark and if we make 2 percentage points on balance, that's quite significant statement, if you mix and match the old with the new business. And therefore, we should see continuation of that. And of course, now with the new person, I think we should give him as well some time, despite that he has been, of course, engaged very much in those, in the discussion of the next steps, anyway, before he will communicates more of what he want to do in addition to what we are doing at the moment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Joynson (Analysts)】\nJust one question remaining from my side, please. Just regarding cash payout to shareholders. Given that the free cash flow performance during 2013 was so strong at around EUR 700 million more than you'll need to cover the post-ordinary dividend, could you tell us whether any additional cash return to shareholders beyond the ordinary dividend was considered, for instance, through a special dividend or a share buyback? And in general, could you maybe provide some color on the circumstances that you would need to see for a special dividend or share buyback to be considered in the future?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nYes. Thanks, Robert. So 2013, we think of as an excellent year for cash flow performance. It was accentuated by the transitory effects that we talked about, so maybe the excess wasn't as great as it initially appears. We do expect, as we talked about on Penny's question, that 2014 is also going to be quite a good year, and we'll, at least, be able to cover the now higher dividend, and even taking into account those mentioned timing effects from 2013. So in 2015, I would say we would see as the time where we would generate then significant excess free cash flow and also have potentially higher credit ratings. So we don't want to forecast when and whether the rating agencies are going to upgrade us. But we think if we stay on the current trajectory, we certainly have chances for higher ratings. But I think, right now, it's just too early to decide in line with our finance policy how the potential excess cash flow will be deployed and whether it's to further pension funding or to shareholder distributions. And then if it's the latter, in which form? It's just probably too early, at this point, to make a forecast about that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nYes. And let me add one thing, which is not different from what Larry have just said, but to remind you, I said a couple of quarters ago that after we have fixed our problems, we have focused to earn the cost of capital, the next step is focus on cash flow. That was in the second half of 2012. And the impact of the organization is deliver very carefully, which is tremendous. So as I always said, let's make the money first before we talk about what we should do with the money. And I think what we have seen is good progress, that our executives are more incentives as well on cash flow has paid off, and that is good news. But we have to work hard again to continue to generate a significant free cash flow. And therefore, I would second what Larry just said. I think let's see that we continue to work hard on that, and then we will see what we want to do with the money. But I can reassure you, we have no major plans to make bold acquisitions whatsoever. We will remain to optimize our operations and grow at excellent speed organically. That's our goal and not to make any major acquisitions going forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robin Byde (Analysts)】\nI guess, as we're getting close to the end, I'll just ask one. On KfW, I think they still own about 21% of the company. Do you have any sense given the share price recovery that the federal government or KfW might be sellers?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nSo that is a secret for me as well. Unfortunately, that's a secret as well for me because if it would not be and I would be in a difficult -- what I think -- the current government is definitely a different one than the previous one where the liberals always said, \"Sell the shares down of state on enterprises.\" And that's the reason why the last tranche rate sold about between EUR 15 and EUR 16 just a while ago. We don't know if they really plan to sell down further, and we will learn that in due course as well. It's a political decision. You have seen that the German government is planning to have no budget deficit next year, so they would just do it out of political reasons. I think they still get a very good return on their investment from the dividend. It's also, for them, tax-free, I guess. So they are German shareholders. So we don't know, actually, Robin. We don't know, and we feel happy with them. I think they had not hindered us in any way to do right and tedious decisions for the company, and they have supported that very much as well. And therefore, we just have to wait what their political decision on that subject is. But with the liberals not in the government, I think the likelihood that they continue rapidly is smaller than it had been when the liberals were a part of the government, I would guess.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Ziegenbalg (Executives)】\nOkay. Well, thanks, Robin, for being so mindful of our time and being so crisp. So I think we've got one last caller that we could take care of.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andre Mulder (Analysts)】\nTwo questions, if I may. First one is on the DHL target for '15. At the previous Capital Markets Day, you said that the growth that you saw for the DHL operations would also apply to each of the 3 decisions there. Do you still have confidence that all of these 3 decisions will meet the targets on a separate basis? Second question is, in a previous occasion, so you said that EXPRESS made market share gains in all regions, so would that also be applicable for Q4?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nSo let me answer the second question. Larry will comment on more of the numbers. So we don't know yet because we have no market intelligence on the last quarter. So therefore, we can't just say if that's the case. We believe that our growth we have seen in the fourth quarter is partially driven by market share gain, looking into what our competitors have reported. But since we have not done any survey, that's more indirect evidence by seeing what their growth rate has been and ours. And ours has been another quarter above what our competitors have seen [ph]. So I would say, I think we have gained market share and not different from probably, for now, 2.5, 3 years in a row, but we have no really hard figures to support that except the volume growth of our competitors.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nSo on the 2015 guidance, we, again, today, have confirmed the guidance in all respects. Just pointing out that we've made an adjustment for the shift of some smaller domestic parcel businesses from the DHL side to the MAIL side, and we've decreased DHL to account for that and increased MAIL by exactly the same amount. So overall, the guidance is not changed nor are any of the underlying components.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Ziegenbalg (Executives)】\nOperator, are there any further callers out there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Ziegenbalg (Executives)】\nOkay. So at least we can stick to our little schedule very well. Thank you out there very much for taking the time. We're looking forward to seeing at least some of you over the next couple of days when we do our roadshowing activities. And of course, we're looking forward to seeing you on our Capital Markets Day. A detailed invite will go out in the nearer future, obviously. And before closing, I just want to hand over to Frank for some concluding remarks.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nYes. So to summarize the call, we are satisfied with the last year's numbers. We have met most of our guidances or some of them. We slightly outperformed on free cash flow. We outperformed them probably quite strongly. We explained why that is the case. We are satisfied with 2013. I think we have clear goals as well for 2014 and remain confident that we can make the guidance for next year. As I've said at the beginning, it still remains hard work because the economy doesn't have too much, and foreign exchange doesn't have either. So the goal is challenging. But as I've said, we are confident to make it happen. So -- and with that, I would like to thank you for joining us this afternoon and for all the nice questions and good questions you had. And with that, we will see you soon at the Capital Markets Day, I guess, to talk a little bit more about what our plans going forward will be.",

      "transcript_text1": "Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and warm welcome to the presentation of the Sika Results 2013. I'm happy to see you all here. I will give you the highlights of 2013, and after, Adrian Widmer, will present the details in -- the results in more detail, then I will come back with our Strategy 2018 and outlook for the ongoing business here. \r\nWe had a very exciting year 2013, I'm very happy with what our employees delivered in all our markets. We had, for the first time, sales of over CHF 5 billion, and also we had record numbers in all our key financial indicators from the operating profit to the net profit to the operating free cash flow. \r\nWe are very happy also to see our growth momentum, which picked up throughout the year. As you remember, we started very slow in the first quarter of the year, and then we have an amazing growth momentum in the following months and quarters. \r\nWe grew in all regions, even in Europe with some crisis market, we could grow. And of course, our growth engine, the emerging markets, in our case, did not lose any speed. We finished the year with over 17% growth in local currency, and despite all the currency devaluation in some of these markets even in Swiss francs, we were over 11% sales growth in Swiss francs in these emerging markets. \r\nSo we are very proud of our numbers, I think, what our people delivered around the globe for 2013. Maybe even more important than the numbers, I think, is the investments we did for the future of Sika. We opened 10 new factories in the growth markets around the world. This is a record number. We never opened 10 factories in 1 year. This is our commitment to our growth strategy. Also, our research and development departments around the globe worked with full force. We applied for 73 new patents and we introduced new products in all our target markets. \r\nLast but not least, we had 5 acquisitions completed in 2013. This was one of the most active years regarding acquisitions for Sika. And to put all this together for the future, we have defined our Strategy 2018, which we will talk about later. \r\nSome details, when you look at our profit and loss statements, we have a very nice through flow here from the growth in Swiss francs of plus 6.5%. And based on the increase in gross margins, which we could achieve, and our disciplined cost management,  the operating profit increased by 20.9% and the net profit by 23.8%. \r\nVery important for us also the free cash flow, here with the high net profit, we also achieved a lowering of our networking capital, which gives us a record result here in the operating free cash flow of CHF 432 million, which is a plus of 43%. \r\nI want to share some reports here with you regarding our regions. As I said, we are very happy we could grow in all our 4 regions, even in Europe, we had a very nice growth here, partially driven by the acquisitions, but also we had organic growth here in Europe, Middle East and Africa. Very happy to see that the crisis markets in Spain, Portugal and Greece, they have bottomed out, and we are confident that from now on, we will also see growth in these markets. We have may be new crisis markets like Italy, but overall, we had very stable volumes in our key markets of Switzerland, Germany, France, England, and also Scandinavia and Eastern Europe. \r\nWe have, in North America, we were maybe slightly disappointed with the recovery of the markets. We saw a big recovery in the residential building sector with the record number of new building permits of plus 25%. Also, we grew, accordingly, in this segment, but the infrastructure and the industrial building sector we're very slow and still negative in 2013. Nevertheless, we at least grew 2% under these circumstances. \r\nThen our 2 growth areas, Asia/Pacific and Latin America, which I think very convincing results here. Asia/Pacific, we had double-digit growth in all the emerging markets from China to all the markets in Southeast Asias, and we also had growth in the OECD markets of Japan, Korea, Australia and New Zealand. \r\nLatin America, some difficult markets, some, as you know, Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil is slowing down. Nevertheless, we have very convincing results here in all these markets. \r\nWhen you look at our emerging markets strategy, we are well on our way. We grew over 17%, even 11% in Swiss francs, and now, we make CHF 2 billion in the emerging markets, which makes 38% of our group sales. \r\nWe have, when you look at our net sales, I think, we are on a very good growth momentum here, when you'll see the growth of 2012 and 2013. We are quite proud that in these difficult times we can have such momentum. \r\nFrom the operating profit side, you'll see we have done, I think, our homework. 2012, we had to recover our margins, if you remember. End-of-the-year is a plus of CHF 86 million in operating profit, and this year, we continued with the growth strategy, improve the margins further and achieved even a plus of CHF 90 million in operating profit. \r\nWhen you look at our new factories, we are extremely proud that our people were able to open 10 new factories in 2013. For the first time, we went into Laos, we went into Iraq, Ukraine, we just opened the factory in June 2013, and in Angola, Africa, we also opened our first factory last year. \r\nWe have then in other emerging markets, we have already multiple factories, so we opened a third plant in Russia; the fourth plant already in Columbia; second, South Africa; the 11th plant in China; second plant in Hanoi, Vietnam; and the second plant in Romania. You see our business has a lot of potential, a lot of market potential and we are not only keen to have 1 factory in these markets, most markets need more factories than one to cover the full market potential. \r\nWe have then from the acquisitions side, we were very happy that last year we had many opportunities to welcome great companies to join Sika. So it was one of the most active years we could close Optiroc in Singapore, a producer of cementitious powder and a market leader in Singapore, also with a plant in South Malaysia. We acquired the second biggest acquisition of Sika ever, was the Building Adhesives Business of AkzoNobel. They are mainly active in Europe in the markets of Germany, France, Switzerland, Scandinavia and Eastern Europe. Radmix,  a specialty company for fibers for the concrete business in Australia. We have the opportunity to buy 2 membrane factories in India and Mexico, which are excellent fit for our waterproofing strategy in these markets. And we have one of the greatest companies in Britain, Everbuild, which this year, is going to make sales of around CHF 100 million, and a professional supplier of the craftsman sector of sealing, bonding and refurbishment products in the U.K. \r\nSo while you were asking last year the same time why we acquired so little in 2012, it's always a question of opportunities, so we were happy and lucky to really find the great companies who were willing to join us here in 2013. \r\nThat's my introduction of the highlights. And now I would like to hand over to Adrian to give us more details on the financials.\n\n---\n\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Also, a warm welcome from my side. I'm very happy to present to you now the full-year results 2013, which show improvements in all areas. I will now address those specifically. \r\nIf we look at our sales growth in 2013, it shows a very balanced picture. Organic growth of 5.9%, or in absolute terms, CHF 285 million, was complimented by an acquisition growth component of 3.5% or CHF 169 million. Negative currency translation effects amounted to minus CHF 141 million or a negative 2.9%, effectively reducing our constant currency growth of 9.4% to 6.5% in Swiss francs. \r\nIn looking at the quarterly growth, we can clearly see an accelerating growth momentum throughout the year. Q1 was even slightly negative. This was largely due to very harsh weather conditions in the first quarter in Europe and in North America, but also influenced by the public holiday pattern. So we effectively have to look at the first 2 quarters in combination, but even then at 4% growth, there was a clear acceleration throughout the year. Not only organically, but very specifically also from an acquisition point of view, where particularly in the fourth quarter, there was almost 10% contribution from acquisitions. \r\nIt was a very strong quarter, and also organically, which basically means that for this year, this quarter will be very tough to beat. \r\nIf we look at the overall growth this was really very broad-based. All regions contributed. We achieved, once again, a very strong organic growth in constant currencies in the Asia/Pacific and the Latin America region with 15.1% and 12.7%, respectively. \r\nThe largest region, EMEA contributed 8.5% growth, whereas North America contributed 2.3%. \r\nWhile we grew organically in all the regions, the acquisition effect and the foreign exchange impact differed considerably from region to region. \r\nRegion EMEA showed the biggest acquisition impact with 6.4%, whereas APAC and Latin America had quite a negative foreign exchange impact of minus 8% to minus 9%. Acquisition contribution here was relatively small in the case of Asia/Pacific, and the modest 3% in Latin America. \r\nIf we look at our share of the emerging markets, this increased to 38%, up from 37% last year. And the split between the construction area, construction chemicals and products for industrial applications roughly an 80-20 split. \r\nIf we move down on line and look at the margins, we were able to, again, improve our gross results down on material margins, after the big increase in 2012, we added another 20 basis points to the margin. This in spite of a certain dilution effect from acquisitions, a number of factors did contribute to that performance. It's on the one hand, disciplined pricing, new product introductions and mixed management and also some slight purchasing savings. \r\nIn looking at the cost development, we can see that nonmaterial cost clearly developed on the proportionally compared to sales growth. We have a growth of 4.1% while sales grew at 6.5%. \r\nIf we look at the individual components, personnel cost were actually slightly negative, this due to a number of factors. First of all, there was a positive translation effect due to the currency effects, the same as on the sales line here on the cost line works in a positive way. We also did selected structural adjustments in markets and where economic development and was -- not so good, was bad in the last couple of years. This is an ongoing process. And also, we had a one-time impact, a one-time positive impact due to the adjustment of the pension conversion rate in the Swiss pension fund, which amounted to a net CHF 16 million. \r\nIf we look at the other operating expenses and that depreciation, here, the development was slightly higher compared to sales growth. This is due to integration and acquisition costs, as well as costs related to the accelerated investment in the supply chain. \r\nAll-in-all, this contributed to the strong EBIT performance and the improvement of almost 20% to CHF 523.5 million. \r\nIf we look at the financial expenses, we had an increase of roughly 8%, lower interest expense were offset by lower interest income and higher hedging and foreign exchange valuation impacts. The tax rate increased from or decreased from 28.6% to 27.7%, essentially leading to a net profit increase of 23.8% to CHF 344.7 million in 2013. \r\nMoving to the balance sheet. I also want to highlight a few elements on the balance sheet. If we look at the cash position, we achieved cash at hand of more than CHF 1 billion. I will address this a little bit later on when I talk about the cash flow statement. \r\nCurrent assets only increased modestly. This is largely driven by the very disciplined networking capital management. The biggest impact which led to an extension of the balance sheet was in noncurrent assets, largely an increase of intangibles of about CHF 370 million due to the acquisition activity in 2013. This is both goodwill, as well as amortizable intangibles. \r\nIf we move to the other side of the balance sheet, you can see an increase in current liabilities. This is, on the one hand, driven by higher accounts payable, as well as a change in the maturity of our bonds of a net CHF 50 million. \r\nNoncurrent liabilities increased relatively little. This is in spite of an increase in net bond financing of CHF 100 million, but also affected by lower pension liabilities. If we look at the equity, this essentially is the net profit minus the dividends we paid in 2013, and leading to an extension of the balance sheet of CHF 451.8 million. In spite of this, we were able to increase our return on capital employed to 21%, up from 18.5% in 2012. \r\nTalking about net working capital. In 2013, we were again able to lower our net working capital to CHF 889 million at year end 2013. This is 17.3% as a percentage of sales. This was partially -- positively affected or impacted by foreign exchange translation, but even without this affect, as you can see at the bottom end of the chart, at constant exchange rates, we were able to continue the positive trend of net working capital reduction in the last few years. \r\nThis leads me to the cash flow statement. Cash flow from operating activities increased very strongly by about CHF 147 million. This again, is driven by increased profitability as well as the disciplined net working capital management. \r\nCash flow from investing activities, which works the other way also increased very strongly. This is largely-driven by our acquisition activities, acquisition spend was CHF 411 million, as well as a net capital expenditure of CHF 141 million. This leads to a free cash flow of CHF 19 million, which essentially means that we were able to finance all our investment and acquisition activities and from operating activities in 2013. \r\nIf we are adding the financing component here, which is a net increase in bond financing and left the dividends, we added another CHF 23.9 million to overall cash, and with the exchange difference of roughly CHF 9 million, we had an increase of cash, an increase in liquid funds of CHF 34 million in 2013. \r\nConcluding my remarks on the financial results, I would like to show you the 5-year overview of net profit development. Similarly to EBIT development, a strong increase by about 60% in the last 2 years. And even more so, if we look at operating free cash flow, more than doubling the amount in 2011 and also higher in absolute value compared to year 2009. This brings me to the dividend proposal. \r\nThe Board of Directors proposes another increase in dividend by CHF 6 per bearer share to CHF 57 per share up and from CHF 51 per share. And for the registered shares, an increase of CHF 1 to CHF 9.5. \r\nWith this, I conclude my remarks on the result and hand back to our CEO for the strategy and the outlook.\n\n---\n\nLadies and gentlemen, besides all the initiatives which you have seen in new factories, new products and market expansion, we took time in 2013 to develop and define our Strategy 2018. This was a -- is quite a process in Sika, we're not doing this only a top-down maybe like our people are doing this, we strongly do this from the bottom up, as Sika has a very decentralized management style. We also do the strategy bottom-up and top-down. So we have the strategy, I present to you, is not only the headquarters strategy, but you will find this strategy in all our countries and is based basically on all the country plans where we are active. \r\nFirst of all, we believe in Sika. We are active in very attractive industry and very attractive markets. When you look at the overall picture, as we define the markets in our 7 target markets from concrete, waterproofing to roofing, flooring, sealing, bonding, refurbishment and then our industry business. You see the numbers currently, we believe, these markets are CHF 60 billion big, compared to our sales of CHF 5.14 billion. This gives us a market share of may be between 8% to 9%, so there is plenty of room for us to grow. \r\nAnd there you see the development for 2018, we believe our markets will grow an average 3% each year for the next 5 years. \r\nThere are some megatrends behind this development in the markets which are very favorable for Sika, and I'm very happy to show that and share that with you. \r\nFirst of all, is the growing demand for Sika products based on urbanization and megacities. I think we hear this every day that the world population is growing at quite a rapid pace, not only in Switzerland, but also in all other markets around the globe. What is even more exciting for us is that this growth takes place not on the countryside but in the cities. So we see bigger cities, more cities and we see the so-called megacities. This is very exciting for us because the bigger the city, the more Sika products you need to use. Why? Because you have the high-rise buildings. The high-rise building needs a totally higher concrete quality compared to low-rise housing. So if you want to build high-rise buildings, you need very high specification on your concrete and we are of course, very happy to support this with our products. At the same time, all these megacities or the high-rise buildings they have flat roofs. Our roofing and waterproofing products, they are for flat roofs. We are not a tile manufacturer for the pitched roofs, we do our membranes and our liquid PU and acrylic products for flat roofs, and you can imagine that this city trend is a huge driver of our product demand for our products. \r\nAt the same time, you also built wherever you have space and land, you're not concerned so much with water in the ground like we were before, so you build this high-rise building, they go very deep in the ground, and they are also built in the areas where you wouldn't built before in the past, so you need plenty of good waterproofing to make these buildings happening. \r\nThen of course, all these buildings, the stand outs for safety, for fire standards, also for earthquake resistant, as you can read in the media is increasing year-by-year and you need solid Sika adhesives and bonding products to make this happening in the buildings. \r\nLast but not the least, these megacities have a totally different demand and higher demand for infrastructure. What does it mean? You need the subways, you need these special highways, elevated highways, you really have to invest totally different in the infrastructure to keep these cities running, and you can imagine all these infrastructure projects from subways to bridges to high-rise highways, they need factor 10x Sika products compared to regular building for infrastructure maybe on the countryside. \r\nSo we're very excited about the urbanization and the megacities, and believe we can play an important role here for the future of these cities. \r\nWhen we go to another leg of Sika, in the motor vehicle industry, you'll see the trend for lighter cars, for electrical cars, for safer cars, we have that in the newspaper every day. And one key trend behind this is that these cars are using new materials. You all read about the BMW i3. That's the first mass vehicle built completely out of carbon fiber. And this carbon fiber cannot be welded anymore like the traditional steel body of a car, it has to be bonded. And they're using large amounts of adhesives, as you can imagine to really bond all these different carbon fiber parts together. \r\nWe have different trends also for other materials, the modern car is not a steel car anymore, they use a combination of steel, of high-strength steel, of magnesium, of aluminum and all these different material mix cannot be welded anymore, has to be bonded. So we have a huge increase of bonding applications in the motor vehicle industry, and we are very confident that this is a very important megatrend for us in the future. \r\nWe have then -- the third megatrend, which is increasing the trend for Sika products is sustainability. Yes, all are aware of that. It's a huge task for everyone. So buildings in the future have to be better isolated, have to be better sealed, and this can be done, of course, with fantastic sealing solutions from Sika. Also, the durability and the life cycle concepts for this buildings, you need high quality to make this building last a very long time. You see the gentleman here enjoying the flat roof here in the megacity, and this green roof is only possible because we have a special Sika membrane system underneath, which allows to grow plants and grass on the roof. \r\nLast but not the least, also our products have a big challenge. We want to be, of course, we want to be the front-runner with green products. We don't want to harm any user with our products and we have big developments to have safe chemistry available for the consumer and the applicator. \r\nSo these are the 3 megatrends, which I want to present to you, which we believe is a strong driver of the future growth. It of course, it doesn't come overnight. The construction industry, the motor vehicle industry is conservative, they have a long planning period, so you will see a positive effect of 1%, 2% or 3% each year for our markets, but I think for a very, very long period of time. \r\nWhen you look at the competitive situation, you notice that our industry is still very fragmented. When you look at the construction chemical market, the market is CHF 50 billion big, maybe a little bit bigger, Sika is the largest competitor in this field, the market leader. And if I add the next 4 competitors total market share is only 26%. So here's also plenty of room for us to consolidate the market and to grow the market. \r\nWhen I look at our position, I think we are in excellent shape, excellent position with our target market concept, which we introduced 1 year ago on 7 target markets. We are focused with our core competencies of bonding, sealing, damping, reinforcing and protecting for this 7 target markets to make the right additives for the concrete, provide liquid and membrane solutions for waterproofing, the same for the roofing to have our epoxy polyurethane, floorings for factories but also for hospitals, for office buildings. We are one of the leading companies in sealing and bonding for construction and for the motor vehicle industry. And last but not least, we offer the right repair and refurbishment solutions in all our application fields. \r\nI think this is a good position to be in. Our footprint, I think, is very strong. We are the market leader already in construction chemicals. We are the leader in adhesives, maybe #2 or #3 biggest adhesive company in the world. Our focus on innovation has been our history for over 100 years. We have currently over 800 people working in the labs around the world on new products and new product introductions for our customers. And in 2013 alone they were writing 73 patents. \r\nIn the emerging markets we believe we are the first movers. You have seen the list of new factories in these markets in 2013 alone, and we believe, here, we can further push here and be the market leader clearly in this emerging markets. Our global footprint, we are close to the customer already now, we operate over 160 factories around the world. We are maybe one of the few companies who really have a global brands and, for sure, the strongest brand here globally in the industry. \r\nI think one of our key success factors is our company culture. We are very entrepreneurial-driven company. We give a lot of responsibility and empowerment to our people. Also, especially to our people in the countries. General Manager of the country doesn't wait till someone in Switzerland pushes a button, they make their own decisions and usually, they make the right decisions and they move much faster compared to centralized organizations. Last but not least, we have a solid financial position which gives us the freedom to act also in the future. \r\nSo we defined our Strategy 2018, we call it building trust, and we believe the Sika growth model, which we defined will ensure our long-term success and our profitable growth for the company in the future. We believe we have a excellent position in our 7 target markets. We can provide a full range of solutions to our customers for all these megaprojects around the globe. Innovation is the core of our company. This will continue. The acceleration of the emerging markets makes us very confident also for the future growth. And last but not least, we have our Sika spirit, our sets of principles and values, which makes up the entrepreneurial spirit of our company. \r\nWe have defined the Sika's values and principles for the first time in writing. I think you also have a handout for it because today is our official launch also of these statements of Sika. \r\nIf you look at our growth model, in 5 points, it's very is simple. This is what our 16,290 employees move everyday. We want to penetrate the market with our full range from roof to floor, we are doing new buildings, same as refurbishments. You have to imagine we do in markets like Switzerland, U.S., or Germany, maybe 80% of our sales is related to refurbishment, while the emerging markets, 95% is new build. So we have a very good balance from new build to refurbishment, makes us also, I think, very crisis resistant because we don't rely on 1 area only. \r\nOur global technology leadership is what really drives the company. Wherever you go, in our business they talk about new products and how to solve the customer problem. Accelerated buildup of emerging markets. We opened 6 new factories in 2012, another 10 factories last year and for this year, we target to open 8 new factories. Acquisitions, we're in a good position. I think we did about 50 acquisitions in the last 12 years. Last year, we were quite active, maybe one of the most, or the most active year in Sika's history. Here I think we have a good process and good principles to also create value through these acquisitions. And last but not least, this model only works because we have the people behind. We have people who see themselves as entrepreneurs, who are empowered by us, who get the responsibility to do the job. \r\nOur Targets through 2018. We, of course, we will continue our growth strategy. We believe we will achieve 6% to 8% growth annually until 2018. The share of the emerging markets will further increase to somewhere 42% to 45%. From the margins side we believe that the double-digit EBIT margin we achieved in 2013 is not a one-time event. We believe that we can achieve this now year-by-year. \r\nSame for the operating free cash flow, important also for us to do our own financing within the groups, also here we target to be above 6% of net sales for the future. And return on capital employed will stay above 20%, and also our A- rating is an important element to be able to be strong and self-sufficient on the finance side. \r\nThis is my explanation and introduction to the Strategy 2018. This strategy is already now implemented in Sika, it's based on all country plans and we are executing already with full force. \r\nNow I would like to come to the outlook 2014. We believe in line with the strategy we will see 6% to 8% growth for 2014. We will continue to build up the emerging markets. We have plans for 8 new factories this year, all of them in the emerging markets. \r\nFor Asia/Pacific, we see a continued good situation in China and in Southeast Asia, maybe with the exception of Thailand. We don't know if how the unrest develops but as we know, this political unrest can go away in Thailand quite fast, but also maybe can be a bigger problem. But overall, we are very confident. We're also confident that we will slightly grow in the OECD countries in Japan, Korea and the Pacific area, we believe with the new products, which we introduced in these markets that we will also grow in these mature markets. \r\nLatin America, I think we'll see a little bit more trouble in 2014 compared to 2013. We have the Venezuela case, we have the Argentina case, we don't know the slowdown in Brazil. I was in Brazil in January this year, I think in the third week, and the people said, normally we don't work very hard until the Carnival, which this year is very late in March, and then we have the Soccer Championship in June, July, and we have the general election in October this year. So we have also some uphill battles in Brazil this year. However, we are confident that overall, we would have a double-digit growth again in Latin America, even so the market might be a bit more bumpy compared to 2013. \r\nNorth America. I think it's time now, after we saw a very nice development of the residential building sector, that the industrial and the infrastructure segment will also show some signs of growth in 2014. So hopefully, we can achieve single-digit growth, around 5% to 6% in North America. This would be my expectations at this point in time. \r\nThen in EMEA, we had, I would say, a better-than-expected market environment in 2013, and we also believe that this very slow recovery will continue into this year, plus we have the growth regions of Africa and the Middle East, where we expect, of course, a bigger growth. \r\nOn the margin side, we believe we will have rather stable margins with all the little bumps ahead from the exchange rates and also taking all these new factories into operations. We believe that the margin will develop proportionately to the sales growth in 2014. \r\nGood. Then I think we are finished with the formal presentation, and we are very happy to answer questions.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nLadies and gentlemen, good morning, and warm welcome to the presentation of the Sika Results 2013. I'm happy to see you all here. I will give you the highlights of 2013, and after, Adrian Widmer, will present the details in -- the results in more detail, then I will come back with our Strategy 2018 and outlook for the ongoing business here. \r\nWe had a very exciting year 2013, I'm very happy with what our employees delivered in all our markets. We had, for the first time, sales of over CHF 5 billion, and also we had record numbers in all our key financial indicators from the operating profit to the net profit to the operating free cash flow. \r\nWe are very happy also to see our growth momentum, which picked up throughout the year. As you remember, we started very slow in the first quarter of the year, and then we have an amazing growth momentum in the following months and quarters. \r\nWe grew in all regions, even in Europe with some crisis market, we could grow. And of course, our growth engine, the emerging markets, in our case, did not lose any speed. We finished the year with over 17% growth in local currency, and despite all the currency devaluation in some of these markets even in Swiss francs, we were over 11% sales growth in Swiss francs in these emerging markets. \r\nSo we are very proud of our numbers, I think, what our people delivered around the globe for 2013. Maybe even more important than the numbers, I think, is the investments we did for the future of Sika. We opened 10 new factories in the growth markets around the world. This is a record number. We never opened 10 factories in 1 year. This is our commitment to our growth strategy. Also, our research and development departments around the globe worked with full force. We applied for 73 new patents and we introduced new products in all our target markets. \r\nLast but not least, we had 5 acquisitions completed in 2013. This was one of the most active years regarding acquisitions for Sika. And to put all this together for the future, we have defined our Strategy 2018, which we will talk about later. \r\nSome details, when you look at our profit and loss statements, we have a very nice through flow here from the growth in Swiss francs of plus 6.5%. And based on the increase in gross margins, which we could achieve, and our disciplined cost management,  the operating profit increased by 20.9% and the net profit by 23.8%. \r\nVery important for us also the free cash flow, here with the high net profit, we also achieved a lowering of our networking capital, which gives us a record result here in the operating free cash flow of CHF 432 million, which is a plus of 43%. \r\nI want to share some reports here with you regarding our regions. As I said, we are very happy we could grow in all our 4 regions, even in Europe, we had a very nice growth here, partially driven by the acquisitions, but also we had organic growth here in Europe, Middle East and Africa. Very happy to see that the crisis markets in Spain, Portugal and Greece, they have bottomed out, and we are confident that from now on, we will also see growth in these markets. We have may be new crisis markets like Italy, but overall, we had very stable volumes in our key markets of Switzerland, Germany, France, England, and also Scandinavia and Eastern Europe. \r\nWe have, in North America, we were maybe slightly disappointed with the recovery of the markets. We saw a big recovery in the residential building sector with the record number of new building permits of plus 25%. Also, we grew, accordingly, in this segment, but the infrastructure and the industrial building sector we're very slow and still negative in 2013. Nevertheless, we at least grew 2% under these circumstances. \r\nThen our 2 growth areas, Asia/Pacific and Latin America, which I think very convincing results here. Asia/Pacific, we had double-digit growth in all the emerging markets from China to all the markets in Southeast Asias, and we also had growth in the OECD markets of Japan, Korea, Australia and New Zealand. \r\nLatin America, some difficult markets, some, as you know, Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil is slowing down. Nevertheless, we have very convincing results here in all these markets. \r\nWhen you look at our emerging markets strategy, we are well on our way. We grew over 17%, even 11% in Swiss francs, and now, we make CHF 2 billion in the emerging markets, which makes 38% of our group sales. \r\nWe have, when you look at our net sales, I think, we are on a very good growth momentum here, when you'll see the growth of 2012 and 2013. We are quite proud that in these difficult times we can have such momentum. \r\nFrom the operating profit side, you'll see we have done, I think, our homework. 2012, we had to recover our margins, if you remember. End-of-the-year is a plus of CHF 86 million in operating profit, and this year, we continued with the growth strategy, improve the margins further and achieved even a plus of CHF 90 million in operating profit. \r\nWhen you look at our new factories, we are extremely proud that our people were able to open 10 new factories in 2013. For the first time, we went into Laos, we went into Iraq, Ukraine, we just opened the factory in June 2013, and in Angola, Africa, we also opened our first factory last year. \r\nWe have then in other emerging markets, we have already multiple factories, so we opened a third plant in Russia; the fourth plant already in Columbia; second, South Africa; the 11th plant in China; second plant in Hanoi, Vietnam; and the second plant in Romania. You see our business has a lot of potential, a lot of market potential and we are not only keen to have 1 factory in these markets, most markets need more factories than one to cover the full market potential. \r\nWe have then from the acquisitions side, we were very happy that last year we had many opportunities to welcome great companies to join Sika. So it was one of the most active years we could close Optiroc in Singapore, a producer of cementitious powder and a market leader in Singapore, also with a plant in South Malaysia. We acquired the second biggest acquisition of Sika ever, was the Building Adhesives Business of AkzoNobel. They are mainly active in Europe in the markets of Germany, France, Switzerland, Scandinavia and Eastern Europe. Radmix,  a specialty company for fibers for the concrete business in Australia. We have the opportunity to buy 2 membrane factories in India and Mexico, which are excellent fit for our waterproofing strategy in these markets. And we have one of the greatest companies in Britain, Everbuild, which this year, is going to make sales of around CHF 100 million, and a professional supplier of the craftsman sector of sealing, bonding and refurbishment products in the U.K. \r\nSo while you were asking last year the same time why we acquired so little in 2012, it's always a question of opportunities, so we were happy and lucky to really find the great companies who were willing to join us here in 2013. \r\nThat's my introduction of the highlights. And now I would like to hand over to Adrian to give us more details on the financials.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Adrian Widmer (Executives)】\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Also, a warm welcome from my side. I'm very happy to present to you now the full-year results 2013, which show improvements in all areas. I will now address those specifically. \r\nIf we look at our sales growth in 2013, it shows a very balanced picture. Organic growth of 5.9%, or in absolute terms, CHF 285 million, was complimented by an acquisition growth component of 3.5% or CHF 169 million. Negative currency translation effects amounted to minus CHF 141 million or a negative 2.9%, effectively reducing our constant currency growth of 9.4% to 6.5% in Swiss francs. \r\nIn looking at the quarterly growth, we can clearly see an accelerating growth momentum throughout the year. Q1 was even slightly negative. This was largely due to very harsh weather conditions in the first quarter in Europe and in North America, but also influenced by the public holiday pattern. So we effectively have to look at the first 2 quarters in combination, but even then at 4% growth, there was a clear acceleration throughout the year. Not only organically, but very specifically also from an acquisition point of view, where particularly in the fourth quarter, there was almost 10% contribution from acquisitions. \r\nIt was a very strong quarter, and also organically, which basically means that for this year, this quarter will be very tough to beat. \r\nIf we look at the overall growth this was really very broad-based. All regions contributed. We achieved, once again, a very strong organic growth in constant currencies in the Asia/Pacific and the Latin America region with 15.1% and 12.7%, respectively. \r\nThe largest region, EMEA contributed 8.5% growth, whereas North America contributed 2.3%. \r\nWhile we grew organically in all the regions, the acquisition effect and the foreign exchange impact differed considerably from region to region. \r\nRegion EMEA showed the biggest acquisition impact with 6.4%, whereas APAC and Latin America had quite a negative foreign exchange impact of minus 8% to minus 9%. Acquisition contribution here was relatively small in the case of Asia/Pacific, and the modest 3% in Latin America. \r\nIf we look at our share of the emerging markets, this increased to 38%, up from 37% last year. And the split between the construction area, construction chemicals and products for industrial applications roughly an 80-20 split. \r\nIf we move down on line and look at the margins, we were able to, again, improve our gross results down on material margins, after the big increase in 2012, we added another 20 basis points to the margin. This in spite of a certain dilution effect from acquisitions, a number of factors did contribute to that performance. It's on the one hand, disciplined pricing, new product introductions and mixed management and also some slight purchasing savings. \r\nIn looking at the cost development, we can see that nonmaterial cost clearly developed on the proportionally compared to sales growth. We have a growth of 4.1% while sales grew at 6.5%. \r\nIf we look at the individual components, personnel cost were actually slightly negative, this due to a number of factors. First of all, there was a positive translation effect due to the currency effects, the same as on the sales line here on the cost line works in a positive way. We also did selected structural adjustments in markets and where economic development and was -- not so good, was bad in the last couple of years. This is an ongoing process. And also, we had a one-time impact, a one-time positive impact due to the adjustment of the pension conversion rate in the Swiss pension fund, which amounted to a net CHF 16 million. \r\nIf we look at the other operating expenses and that depreciation, here, the development was slightly higher compared to sales growth. This is due to integration and acquisition costs, as well as costs related to the accelerated investment in the supply chain. \r\nAll-in-all, this contributed to the strong EBIT performance and the improvement of almost 20% to CHF 523.5 million. \r\nIf we look at the financial expenses, we had an increase of roughly 8%, lower interest expense were offset by lower interest income and higher hedging and foreign exchange valuation impacts. The tax rate increased from or decreased from 28.6% to 27.7%, essentially leading to a net profit increase of 23.8% to CHF 344.7 million in 2013. \r\nMoving to the balance sheet. I also want to highlight a few elements on the balance sheet. If we look at the cash position, we achieved cash at hand of more than CHF 1 billion. I will address this a little bit later on when I talk about the cash flow statement. \r\nCurrent assets only increased modestly. This is largely driven by the very disciplined networking capital management. The biggest impact which led to an extension of the balance sheet was in noncurrent assets, largely an increase of intangibles of about CHF 370 million due to the acquisition activity in 2013. This is both goodwill, as well as amortizable intangibles. \r\nIf we move to the other side of the balance sheet, you can see an increase in current liabilities. This is, on the one hand, driven by higher accounts payable, as well as a change in the maturity of our bonds of a net CHF 50 million. \r\nNoncurrent liabilities increased relatively little. This is in spite of an increase in net bond financing of CHF 100 million, but also affected by lower pension liabilities. If we look at the equity, this essentially is the net profit minus the dividends we paid in 2013, and leading to an extension of the balance sheet of CHF 451.8 million. In spite of this, we were able to increase our return on capital employed to 21%, up from 18.5% in 2012. \r\nTalking about net working capital. In 2013, we were again able to lower our net working capital to CHF 889 million at year end 2013. This is 17.3% as a percentage of sales. This was partially -- positively affected or impacted by foreign exchange translation, but even without this affect, as you can see at the bottom end of the chart, at constant exchange rates, we were able to continue the positive trend of net working capital reduction in the last few years. \r\nThis leads me to the cash flow statement. Cash flow from operating activities increased very strongly by about CHF 147 million. This again, is driven by increased profitability as well as the disciplined net working capital management. \r\nCash flow from investing activities, which works the other way also increased very strongly. This is largely-driven by our acquisition activities, acquisition spend was CHF 411 million, as well as a net capital expenditure of CHF 141 million. This leads to a free cash flow of CHF 19 million, which essentially means that we were able to finance all our investment and acquisition activities and from operating activities in 2013. \r\nIf we are adding the financing component here, which is a net increase in bond financing and left the dividends, we added another CHF 23.9 million to overall cash, and with the exchange difference of roughly CHF 9 million, we had an increase of cash, an increase in liquid funds of CHF 34 million in 2013. \r\nConcluding my remarks on the financial results, I would like to show you the 5-year overview of net profit development. Similarly to EBIT development, a strong increase by about 60% in the last 2 years. And even more so, if we look at operating free cash flow, more than doubling the amount in 2011 and also higher in absolute value compared to year 2009. This brings me to the dividend proposal. \r\nThe Board of Directors proposes another increase in dividend by CHF 6 per bearer share to CHF 57 per share up and from CHF 51 per share. And for the registered shares, an increase of CHF 1 to CHF 9.5. \r\nWith this, I conclude my remarks on the result and hand back to our CEO for the strategy and the outlook.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nLadies and gentlemen, besides all the initiatives which you have seen in new factories, new products and market expansion, we took time in 2013 to develop and define our Strategy 2018. This was a -- is quite a process in Sika, we're not doing this only a top-down maybe like our people are doing this, we strongly do this from the bottom up, as Sika has a very decentralized management style. We also do the strategy bottom-up and top-down. So we have the strategy, I present to you, is not only the headquarters strategy, but you will find this strategy in all our countries and is based basically on all the country plans where we are active. \r\nFirst of all, we believe in Sika. We are active in very attractive industry and very attractive markets. When you look at the overall picture, as we define the markets in our 7 target markets from concrete, waterproofing to roofing, flooring, sealing, bonding, refurbishment and then our industry business. You see the numbers currently, we believe, these markets are CHF 60 billion big, compared to our sales of CHF 5.14 billion. This gives us a market share of may be between 8% to 9%, so there is plenty of room for us to grow. \r\nAnd there you see the development for 2018, we believe our markets will grow an average 3% each year for the next 5 years. \r\nThere are some megatrends behind this development in the markets which are very favorable for Sika, and I'm very happy to show that and share that with you. \r\nFirst of all, is the growing demand for Sika products based on urbanization and megacities. I think we hear this every day that the world population is growing at quite a rapid pace, not only in Switzerland, but also in all other markets around the globe. What is even more exciting for us is that this growth takes place not on the countryside but in the cities. So we see bigger cities, more cities and we see the so-called megacities. This is very exciting for us because the bigger the city, the more Sika products you need to use. Why? Because you have the high-rise buildings. The high-rise building needs a totally higher concrete quality compared to low-rise housing. So if you want to build high-rise buildings, you need very high specification on your concrete and we are of course, very happy to support this with our products. At the same time, all these megacities or the high-rise buildings they have flat roofs. Our roofing and waterproofing products, they are for flat roofs. We are not a tile manufacturer for the pitched roofs, we do our membranes and our liquid PU and acrylic products for flat roofs, and you can imagine that this city trend is a huge driver of our product demand for our products. \r\nAt the same time, you also built wherever you have space and land, you're not concerned so much with water in the ground like we were before, so you build this high-rise building, they go very deep in the ground, and they are also built in the areas where you wouldn't built before in the past, so you need plenty of good waterproofing to make these buildings happening. \r\nThen of course, all these buildings, the stand outs for safety, for fire standards, also for earthquake resistant, as you can read in the media is increasing year-by-year and you need solid Sika adhesives and bonding products to make this happening in the buildings. \r\nLast but not the least, these megacities have a totally different demand and higher demand for infrastructure. What does it mean? You need the subways, you need these special highways, elevated highways, you really have to invest totally different in the infrastructure to keep these cities running, and you can imagine all these infrastructure projects from subways to bridges to high-rise highways, they need factor 10x Sika products compared to regular building for infrastructure maybe on the countryside. \r\nSo we're very excited about the urbanization and the megacities, and believe we can play an important role here for the future of these cities. \r\nWhen we go to another leg of Sika, in the motor vehicle industry, you'll see the trend for lighter cars, for electrical cars, for safer cars, we have that in the newspaper every day. And one key trend behind this is that these cars are using new materials. You all read about the BMW i3. That's the first mass vehicle built completely out of carbon fiber. And this carbon fiber cannot be welded anymore like the traditional steel body of a car, it has to be bonded. And they're using large amounts of adhesives, as you can imagine to really bond all these different carbon fiber parts together. \r\nWe have different trends also for other materials, the modern car is not a steel car anymore, they use a combination of steel, of high-strength steel, of magnesium, of aluminum and all these different material mix cannot be welded anymore, has to be bonded. So we have a huge increase of bonding applications in the motor vehicle industry, and we are very confident that this is a very important megatrend for us in the future. \r\nWe have then -- the third megatrend, which is increasing the trend for Sika products is sustainability. Yes, all are aware of that. It's a huge task for everyone. So buildings in the future have to be better isolated, have to be better sealed, and this can be done, of course, with fantastic sealing solutions from Sika. Also, the durability and the life cycle concepts for this buildings, you need high quality to make this building last a very long time. You see the gentleman here enjoying the flat roof here in the megacity, and this green roof is only possible because we have a special Sika membrane system underneath, which allows to grow plants and grass on the roof. \r\nLast but not the least, also our products have a big challenge. We want to be, of course, we want to be the front-runner with green products. We don't want to harm any user with our products and we have big developments to have safe chemistry available for the consumer and the applicator. \r\nSo these are the 3 megatrends, which I want to present to you, which we believe is a strong driver of the future growth. It of course, it doesn't come overnight. The construction industry, the motor vehicle industry is conservative, they have a long planning period, so you will see a positive effect of 1%, 2% or 3% each year for our markets, but I think for a very, very long period of time. \r\nWhen you look at the competitive situation, you notice that our industry is still very fragmented. When you look at the construction chemical market, the market is CHF 50 billion big, maybe a little bit bigger, Sika is the largest competitor in this field, the market leader. And if I add the next 4 competitors total market share is only 26%. So here's also plenty of room for us to consolidate the market and to grow the market. \r\nWhen I look at our position, I think we are in excellent shape, excellent position with our target market concept, which we introduced 1 year ago on 7 target markets. We are focused with our core competencies of bonding, sealing, damping, reinforcing and protecting for this 7 target markets to make the right additives for the concrete, provide liquid and membrane solutions for waterproofing, the same for the roofing to have our epoxy polyurethane, floorings for factories but also for hospitals, for office buildings. We are one of the leading companies in sealing and bonding for construction and for the motor vehicle industry. And last but not least, we offer the right repair and refurbishment solutions in all our application fields. \r\nI think this is a good position to be in. Our footprint, I think, is very strong. We are the market leader already in construction chemicals. We are the leader in adhesives, maybe #2 or #3 biggest adhesive company in the world. Our focus on innovation has been our history for over 100 years. We have currently over 800 people working in the labs around the world on new products and new product introductions for our customers. And in 2013 alone they were writing 73 patents. \r\nIn the emerging markets we believe we are the first movers. You have seen the list of new factories in these markets in 2013 alone, and we believe, here, we can further push here and be the market leader clearly in this emerging markets. Our global footprint, we are close to the customer already now, we operate over 160 factories around the world. We are maybe one of the few companies who really have a global brands and, for sure, the strongest brand here globally in the industry. \r\nI think one of our key success factors is our company culture. We are very entrepreneurial-driven company. We give a lot of responsibility and empowerment to our people. Also, especially to our people in the countries. General Manager of the country doesn't wait till someone in Switzerland pushes a button, they make their own decisions and usually, they make the right decisions and they move much faster compared to centralized organizations. Last but not least, we have a solid financial position which gives us the freedom to act also in the future. \r\nSo we defined our Strategy 2018, we call it building trust, and we believe the Sika growth model, which we defined will ensure our long-term success and our profitable growth for the company in the future. We believe we have a excellent position in our 7 target markets. We can provide a full range of solutions to our customers for all these megaprojects around the globe. Innovation is the core of our company. This will continue. The acceleration of the emerging markets makes us very confident also for the future growth. And last but not least, we have our Sika spirit, our sets of principles and values, which makes up the entrepreneurial spirit of our company. \r\nWe have defined the Sika's values and principles for the first time in writing. I think you also have a handout for it because today is our official launch also of these statements of Sika. \r\nIf you look at our growth model, in 5 points, it's very is simple. This is what our 16,290 employees move everyday. We want to penetrate the market with our full range from roof to floor, we are doing new buildings, same as refurbishments. You have to imagine we do in markets like Switzerland, U.S., or Germany, maybe 80% of our sales is related to refurbishment, while the emerging markets, 95% is new build. So we have a very good balance from new build to refurbishment, makes us also, I think, very crisis resistant because we don't rely on 1 area only. \r\nOur global technology leadership is what really drives the company. Wherever you go, in our business they talk about new products and how to solve the customer problem. Accelerated buildup of emerging markets. We opened 6 new factories in 2012, another 10 factories last year and for this year, we target to open 8 new factories. Acquisitions, we're in a good position. I think we did about 50 acquisitions in the last 12 years. Last year, we were quite active, maybe one of the most, or the most active year in Sika's history. Here I think we have a good process and good principles to also create value through these acquisitions. And last but not least, this model only works because we have the people behind. We have people who see themselves as entrepreneurs, who are empowered by us, who get the responsibility to do the job. \r\nOur Targets through 2018. We, of course, we will continue our growth strategy. We believe we will achieve 6% to 8% growth annually until 2018. The share of the emerging markets will further increase to somewhere 42% to 45%. From the margins side we believe that the double-digit EBIT margin we achieved in 2013 is not a one-time event. We believe that we can achieve this now year-by-year. \r\nSame for the operating free cash flow, important also for us to do our own financing within the groups, also here we target to be above 6% of net sales for the future. And return on capital employed will stay above 20%, and also our A- rating is an important element to be able to be strong and self-sufficient on the finance side. \r\nThis is my explanation and introduction to the Strategy 2018. This strategy is already now implemented in Sika, it's based on all country plans and we are executing already with full force. \r\nNow I would like to come to the outlook 2014. We believe in line with the strategy we will see 6% to 8% growth for 2014. We will continue to build up the emerging markets. We have plans for 8 new factories this year, all of them in the emerging markets. \r\nFor Asia/Pacific, we see a continued good situation in China and in Southeast Asia, maybe with the exception of Thailand. We don't know if how the unrest develops but as we know, this political unrest can go away in Thailand quite fast, but also maybe can be a bigger problem. But overall, we are very confident. We're also confident that we will slightly grow in the OECD countries in Japan, Korea and the Pacific area, we believe with the new products, which we introduced in these markets that we will also grow in these mature markets. \r\nLatin America, I think we'll see a little bit more trouble in 2014 compared to 2013. We have the Venezuela case, we have the Argentina case, we don't know the slowdown in Brazil. I was in Brazil in January this year, I think in the third week, and the people said, normally we don't work very hard until the Carnival, which this year is very late in March, and then we have the Soccer Championship in June, July, and we have the general election in October this year. So we have also some uphill battles in Brazil this year. However, we are confident that overall, we would have a double-digit growth again in Latin America, even so the market might be a bit more bumpy compared to 2013. \r\nNorth America. I think it's time now, after we saw a very nice development of the residential building sector, that the industrial and the infrastructure segment will also show some signs of growth in 2014. So hopefully, we can achieve single-digit growth, around 5% to 6% in North America. This would be my expectations at this point in time. \r\nThen in EMEA, we had, I would say, a better-than-expected market environment in 2013, and we also believe that this very slow recovery will continue into this year, plus we have the growth regions of Africa and the Middle East, where we expect, of course, a bigger growth. \r\nOn the margin side, we believe we will have rather stable margins with all the little bumps ahead from the exchange rates and also taking all these new factories into operations. We believe that the margin will develop proportionately to the sales growth in 2014. \r\nGood. Then I think we are finished with the formal presentation, and we are very happy to answer questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "Michael Roost from Bank am Bellevue. I just have 3 questions, if I may. First one on your guidance for 2014. The 6% to 8% corridor, is that -- that includes acquisitions, I assume? Then just a question on that because if my assumptions are right, you probably have roughly 5% to 6% positive acquisition effect assuming everything remains as is currently. And then on top of that, if I then work out the currency impact, which, okay, that should be not quite as heavy as what we saw in 2013, but it'll still be there. It still implies at least, even if you hit the top end, which is 8%, it still implies a slowdown of your organic growth. Is that -- how should I read that? Is that a little bit conservative, or -- that's my question there. And then on the second question. On your net working capital, particularly if I look at the breakdown, a lot of that seem to be focused on payables. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color on that? And then my last question is again on the personnel expenses, which reduced. Now you mentioned the positive impact of CHF 16 million on the pension side. Is there anything else that we need to be aware of because even excluding that from the overall number, it seems quite low.\n\n---\n\nAll right. I think Adrian can take the last 2 questions. Maybe I like to answer the growth question. I think for the acquisitions, we don't see EBIT being 5% to 6% maybe. I think it will be a little lower, the contribution for this year. And the only thing I like you to consider is that we have an amazing second half 2013, especially the last quarter was influenced by the mild winter weather. So if you look at 2014 ahead, I think we will not just maybe be able to match the fourth quarter sales of 2013. So we have this exceptional situation where we were overshooting due to the very mild weather. Okay. Nevertheless, having said this, we are very positive. I think we will see a strong first half of the year. However, with all the little bumps ahead in the markets, I think we want to be rather conservative with the sales outlook for the year. It's such an early occasion.\n\n---\n\nNow if I can answer that question on the networking capital. I think we have actually improved the working capital in all areas; it's inventory, receivables and payables. You also have to take into consideration that the absolute number is added by what we acquired. So there is actually an improvement in all the areas, and we are working on all the elements. This is not only story about payables.\n\n---\n\nYou see that as sustainable, the increase in payables?\n\n---\n\nWe see that as sustainable, yes.\n\n---\n\nAnd then the personnel?\n\n---\n\nOn the personnel cost side, as I indicated, there is a number of factors, which actually influenced the net decrease. And all the translation, I mean, you have to add if you compare it to the 9% growth, so this was roughly 2.5% or close to 3% as an impact. And then and we did some structural adjustments in some markets in Southern Europe, in other markets, which we already started in 2012. So all-in-all that was a very disciplined cost management. And in terms of additional people, the increase was in the emerging markets and rather a decrease in mature markets, of course, at higher salaries.\n\n---\n\nIn 2013, several emerging markets have seen a slowdown in growth. How did you manage it to grow so fast in almost all of these countries?\n\n---\n\nFirst of all, I think when the crisis talks started in August with the exchange rates and so on, I think it's always very much driven from the financial industry and not from the really economy, that's my personal observation on this. And second, we have -- we built these companies up -- countries up very solid and with local people. So who understand these markets very well, and who live in these markets. So we have a very stable and solid situation, maybe compared to other businesses who go in or out with -- I don't know with expats or other people. So -- and the facts are supporting what I say, we didn't see a slowdown in our growth for the year end. Also starting off the year, we don't see a slowdown in the emerging markets. We have some hiccups in some markets. You have seen we opened a new factory in the Ukraine last year, so that's a slowing down at the moment, of course. But it's also run by local people, so -- and we have a long-term commitment and maybe we have a slowdown now until the situation clears. But we will continue to be present in this market.\n\n---\n\nIt's Remo Rosenau from Neue Helvetische Bank. Looking a bit more forward on 2018 strategy, if you go to Slide 28, you show that the overall market is around CHF 60 billion. You have about 8% to 9% market share, you say that you have plenty of space to grow. However, if you go back -- if you do a market segmentation, and you go back about 15 years, you were at that time, almost exclusively active in the upper part of the market, in the high quality end of the market. Part of the success of Sika over the last 15 years was that you moved a bit down into the rather into the volume markets, generating strong growth, which initially, at least, had a negative impact on the margins. But you generated still much higher returns, because sales grew over-proportionally. Is now the growth Strategy 2018 based on a similar concept that you in the quality pyramid, you go rather with down into the volume markets more, even more, or do you believe that the quality segment will grow because of urbanization or is it a combination of both? And at the end of the day, what will be the impact on the margin?\n\n---\n\nThat's a very good observation you have. I think traditionally, 10 years or 20 years ago, you always have the market positioning in the pyramid, right,  with a rather small premium segment and some mid segment of the very big business segment. If I look at our markets, I think the markets more look like a snowman with a very big belly. And the mid-segment of the market is in most markets as big as the lower segment. So I think for our strategy and you have seen our margins, how we can deliver, it's not so decisive to be somewhere in the top premium segment. You have to make solutions for the volume segments of the market. And we talked about these megacities. To build such a megacity, we want to be part in every building. We don't want to have some high engineering idea, the roof can only be like this. If the customer wants a liquid applied roof, we have to range for the liquid applied roof. If he wants to have a Sarnafil roof, we are happy to provide a Sarnafil roof. If she wants to have a green roof, which is the top of the pyramid, we're more than happy to provide the green roof. But I think what we learned in recent years is that we cannot only be successful in the volume segments of the market, we also have good margins in this segment.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Another one, the last one. You talked about the decentralized management style of Sika.  Now one of the challenges in such a concept is how can you find out which parts you can still centralize, because there are lots of cost savings in there. So how do you find out what you can sensibly centralize in such a sensibly decentralized model because that is where you can take out costs also.\n\n---\n\nThat's the excitement of my daily job. Always find out what you give locally, and I would not say centralized, I would say what parts of the business you can globalize and you can share. And this is, first of all, a new product. We're trying to make products, which works, of course, in one country, but then the idea is we roll this product out in the region and maybe globally depending on the market situations. So our constant battle is exactly what you say, local responsibility and at the same time, we have to define global competitive advantages and processes. These are new product developments, this is our Sika brand, this is the know-how to build 10 factories in 1 year, so many areas. And it's a constant, how do we say this, argument in our company, of course, what shall be done locally, what shall be done centrally, what is a global best demonstrated practice and I like this very much, and this will continue. There's not one solution to it, there's ongoing battle and if we do 80% right, we are going to be very successful.\n\n---\n\nChristian Arnold Bank Vontobel. I have 2 questions on the one side, and for the outlook 2014, you are guiding 6% to 8% growth, also organic growth included there. But at the same time, you expect margins to remain on the level of 2013, which are high, but remained there. You also commented that it also probably has a reason in the acquisitions and the new factory, which are probably we'll have a negative impact. Nevertheless, that implies no operating leverage so to say, at least as a result. And they wonder if there are some other negative points here you see, so from the raw material side, do you expect negative impact from the raw materials side? Do you expect negative impact from product mix, more concrete product versus industrial products, I should say, so maybe if you can comment on that. And then the second question would be on the long-term on your Strategy 2018, where you somewhat lowered your growth target from 8% to 10% in the past to 6% to 8% going forward, which, of course, probably is also has to be seen in combination with the absolute size of Sika. Sika today is different from Sika from some years ago. Nevertheless, I wonder if you see some other impacts there, if it's more difficult for you to do acquisitions if your own market is going slower than the past, if you can comment on that.\n\n---\n\nI think for the margins, we see a stable situation on the raw material pricing. It can change every day. If the Ukraine comes into war, you already had a small impact on of the crude oil price. But nevertheless, we expect a stable situation of raw materials. For the margins, let's say, we are a bit conservative at this point because the new factories, which came into operation last year, which come into operation this year, they will not be able to make a big contribution to the bottom line in 2014. The acquisitions, I think they are well ahead of plan in the integration also here we have 1, 2 issues, which will burden the margin a bit. So I think it's a very solid comment at this point to say we are very confident to achieve the same EBIT margin as in 2013. Regarding the outlook of the strategy, I think I thought you are going to push us with the old 8% to 10%, which I think was defined back in 2005 or 2006, and then if you'll see the cost of time since in the past 8 or 9 years, that was really a target, which could not -- hardly be achieved in every year. So we took a serious review, and we believe 6% to 8% is still quite a statement, and a good growth strategy for us going forward.\n\n---\n\nJust a follow-up for 2014. In terms of pricing, what do you expect for your pricing? Can you increase your prices?\n\n---\n\nThis is --  we have long-term partnerships with our customers usually when we make a building, it's a 2 to 4-year project, and usually, the people we deal with at the building are also in the car industry, will, we work lifelong with these partners. So at Sika, we don't believe in very drastic and very rapid increases in sales price because we have partnerships with our customers. So for 2014, I think it's a solid position. We done our homework in 2012, and going into 2013, we are, I think, on a good level at the moment. But, of course, we it's -- as we have so many articles in every country, there's always -- pricing is an ongoing issue in the company, of course.\n\n---\n\nBernd Pomrehn from MainFirst. Sorry if I again come back to 2018 targets. In the last 10 years, you achieved an average of local currency growth of above 9%. Last year, you achieved local currency growth of above 9%. What now really has become -- made you more becoming more cautious on the 2018 targets? Is it the organic growth component? Or do you see less acquisitions going forward?\n\n---\n\nI think -- when you see the this growth rate, we have, of course, we had quite some significant acquisitions in there, like Sarnafil at the end of the 2005 and also other acquisitions. We believe in the long run, we want to focus very much on organic growth and innovation. This should be around 2/3 of growth, roughly, and about 1/3 will come from acquisitions. And then again, we can argue a lot about 9% or 6% to 8%. I think we made a very good and positive statement with 6% to 8%, and as the road is a bit bumpy ahead, I think it would be not wise to make any other statements.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And maybe one add-on question. Is it possible to quantify the integration or restructuring cost, either -- or maybe both for last year and for this year?\n\n---\n\nOf course, it's possible, but at Sika, we don't really believe in making all these adjusted EBIT numbers and everything. We believe our company has to look for the short-term, but even more for the long term. So if you see all our investments last year, the acquisition is clear. They didn't contribute to the result in 2013. Nevertheless, we had a strong result and we don't want to come in a situation like I see with that in many cases where we make adjusted EBIT. And so I think our shareholders expect a long-term strategy and solid return numbers each year without making up any story.\n\n---\n\nPhilip Ray from [indiscernible]. Where will you open new plants in 2014? And you have opened one for example, in Angola on last November. And which potential do you see on the longer term in Africa?\n\n---\n\nAll right. We are very excited about Africa. We finalized in 2013, together with our strategy, we defined Africa strategy where at the moment, we have 8 factories in Africa and we have now a plan to increase this number significantly over the next 2 to 3 years. So at the moment, we are present in North Africa, we are in Morrocco, we are in Tunis, Algeria, Egypt, we have 2 plants in South Africa, one in Kenya and one in Angola. And, as you know, there are so many attractive markets in Africa, and we want to grow there now aggressively. We see Africa a little bit like the -- I don't know, the new Southeast Asia or something so, so we want to be present and accelerate our growth.\n\n---\n\nMartin Hüsler, Zurcher Kantonalbank. I have 2 questions. First one, to Latin America. You showed a good growth, but when I calculate correctly, margin came down there. Can you give us some reasons there? Is there still a transaction impact so that you have higher sales growth than local costs? And if this is the case, what is about the difference between share of local cost and share of local sales. And your question turns to your new guidance or targets. I was just wondering why you changed from an EBITDA target to an EBIT target?\n\n---\n\nAll right. I'll take the second one and then Adrian takes the first question.\n\n---\n\nI'll go with the first one.\n\n---\n\nNo, I'll take the first one, you take the second one. I think the EBITDA is very clear. We believe that the in a very low capital intense industry. As you see even we make 10 factories, our investments is a bit over CHF 150 million so this is very exciting for us and very exciting for our growth strategy. That's why we believe we should rather focus on the bottom results and not make some EBITDA, which doesn't make a big difference in our case.\n\n---\n\nYour question on Latin America. I think first statement, we have very, very solid margins in Latin America still. I mean, they have come down a bit. This is clear. And there was indeed some impact, let's say currency related due to the fact that a lot of the raw materials in Latin America are either purchased in dollars or in other currency and some other impacts on the currency side, which gave a bit of a dent on the margin. So on the raw materials side, there is quite a share of, let's say, foreign-denominated cost, and on the operating expenses, most of it is local. So it's not a huge impact, but this year combined with some of the hotspots that were mentioned before, Venezuela and Argentina, that just had an impact on the overall efficiency.\n\n---\n\nDominic Meyer, Bank Vontobel. I have actually 2 questions. The first one is again with regard to growth. An important factor or driver for you is this structural growth, for example, new application, changes from welding to bonding. Can you maybe give some indication what the contribution is of structural growth in the past than going forward? And then second question, could you also give some guidance on CapEx, split up in maintenance and expansion CapEx?\n\n---\n\nAll right. I think structural growth is not so easy to always differentiate because every product which we develop is normally a better product if enhanced performance for the customer. So then you don't know is it now a structural growth because the adhesive to bond the car or the adhesive to make the new high-strength concrete is a structural growth or not. So it's quite difficult for me to answer the question. But I think, as a pointed out, we have plenty of room for the structural growth because of these 3 megatrends, which I presented, we need to have better solutions in the future. So -- but difficult to answer the structural growth question because I think most of our new products are related to enhanced performance.\n\n---\n\nJust if you give a range, is it 1/3, is it 1/5 or...\n\n---\n\nVery hard to say. I would really say you can go a bit with the market what I said. Maybe these megatrends they lead to 2% to 3% growth each year, so maybe 50-50 or something, or maybe around this organic growth rate. The second question was with the investments. I think we've made a lot of improvement in Sika in the past 2 years to standardize our investment process and to make -- to specify the equipment used in a better way, so we lower the necessary investment very significantly. This is why, I think we have quite a reasonable investment number for 2013, and I believe it will maintain in that -- on that level.\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible] overall that is split up in maintenance and...\n\n---\n\nAll right -- so we go from 6 factories in '12 to 10 in '13, to maybe 8 factories in '14, and then a lot depends, of course, on the market dynamics. So '15, I cannot tell. '15, I still expect we're going to have 6 to 8 new factories in the emerging markets. So we, of course, try to focus on new investments rather than maintenance. But it will keep around similar like we showed now the past 2 years, I would think.\n\n---\n\nAnders Borgen. [ph] I would like to ask a question on the supply sides, so the new supplies. Can you make some comments what the situation currently is there in terms of know how much they try to increase the prices, how much capacity is around and how much you and your sites still can optimize the purchasing situation, be it centralized or more reasonable or packaged or which supplier just to get a feeling a bit how this will develop going into 2014?\n\n---\n\nWe are --  they always try to increase the price. The question is, are they able to? We are quite confident that 2014, we will see a flat development. We have a certain factors pushing it. I think the load capacity in the chemical, raw materials industry is not very good at this point. So even with higher oil prices, the ability to increase prices is, I think, limited for them. On the other hand, what we drive very much in Sika is that we do global sourcing of raw materials, something we didn't do really 10 years ago. But now come with all our push into China, into Korea, Japan, also into Latin America, we, of course, source more and more raw materials locally, which gives us a bit of leverage against big suppliers.\n\n---\n\nAnd maybe second question on the gross margin side. Can you give us a feeling what the pricing in 2013 or what -- at least if you don't want to comment on pricing, at least with the mix price effect, which was a positive, I must say, understood was in 2013 on gross margin?\n\n---\n\nWe had a slightly positive pricing effect in 2013. So the actions which we took in 2012 to bring the margins back up, they also went through into 2013.\n\n---\n\nPatrick Appenzeller, Helvea Baader Bank. I have questions related to gross and margins again, but these are -- this time, rather on a short-term view. You mentioned the tough comparison you might phase in the second half, but on the other hand, you will phase very favorable comparison in the first. I mean, we have now an extremely mild winter against a very cold winter last seen in Europe, which still is a most important for you and U.S. might be similar, but overall, must be quite a significant impact, especially on the first quarter, we also will have Easter ship[ph], the shift in the eastern, which will impact Q1 and Q2. And on the margin side, you had on the fourth quarter, the 13% EBIT margin, which is the highest ever achieved in the fourth quarter, which is seasonally low, and this time seemed to have almost no season impact. So from this 13%, it's hard to believe that you will let's say at least to be stable in the first half-year with certain percent, so I would assume that in the first half-year here, it's quite a bit of positive momentum don't forget the flooding in the second half, which also will provide a likely positive comparison.\n\n---\n\nI fully agree with you. I think we're going to see a solid first half. I think we will see even a very good growth in the first quarter with everything you said and with the good weather conditions. We have a good momentum in the first quarter, of course. However, as you mentioned, the fourth quarter 2013 was very exceptional, and if you ask me today if I can be flat in the fourth quarter, I will sign today for the same sales volumes. So you see, we have to make all growth in 2014. We need to make them in the first 3 quarters, fourth quarter will, I don't think we will able to grow.\n\n---\n\nIs there any indication so far in the year you can give us for feeling about this impact of the weather in the first quarters, in the first 2 months? Is there any flavor you can give us here?\n\n---\n\nIt's a very warm out there. So you see building activities everywhere and you see me also with a smile on the face. So I think we -- again, we're going to have a very good start of the year. But please don't overestimate this if we talk again in April and I don't know the results yet, but if we have a very positive sales, don't overestimate them. We will have more difficulties in the second half.\n\n---\n\nMark [indiscernible]. A very simple question. You still like have many companies, especially in the Arabia and China and emerging markets as such where you don't own 100% is it a target to grow up to 100% to really fully consolidate them or what is your strategy in that context? And what impact could that have on the top line growth?\n\n---\n\nI think traditionally, we are someone who wants to own the company. You see this except for the Middle East where we have a joint venture partner for many, many years. Normally, we own the company in China if it is only 1 or 2 companies at least there have the majority share. And in Japan, we have a 50-50 joint venture for the automotive industry, so we only do joint ventures, I think, in very exceptional cases. We believe with our growth model in Sika, especially with our company culture, it's better to own the company 100%.\n\n---\n\nAnd then maybe second question concerning the innovation. You mentioned the 73 patents that you won last year. How does that compare with the past? And do you plan -- is that going to be the decisive competitive advantage in a still very fragmented markets where smaller companies do not have the power to really come up with the same innovation grade?\n\n---\n\nI believe so. I think the patent is really something we started on a professional level, maybe just 10 or 12 years ago. And the 73 patents, I think, is about the same level as the year before. There was a big increase in patents, of course, over the last 10 years. We believe it's going to be a very strong competitive advantage in the future. Today in the chemical industry, half of the patents are written in China. And despite many discussions about patent protection in China, they are the ones writing the patents. So to protect your company's future, I think in our industry, you have to have patents in the future.\n\n---\n\nIf I may, just last question concerning the market structure in 2018 or maybe some years down the road. You mentioned the top 5 players have a quarter of the market. How is that going to look like then and how many smaller competitors will have to disappear due to the lack of economics of scale and other factors?\n\n---\n\nI don't want to comment on the other competitors. I don't know what they are going to do. I think we're going to move along.  We're going to be the strongest company in 2018. I would expect maybe we're going to have a Chinese company entering this top 5 circle. It's possible. We don't see that at the moment, but it's possible that in 5 years, we have a strong emerging competitor from China.\n\n---\n\nAnd in there is no pressure from like backwards integration or forward integration of some of your content providers, i.e. chemical companies that try to move into the Sika direction?\n\n---\n\nI think you are a better judge of this, you'll see that some the chemical raw material suppliers are doing attempts or trying to go into the front end of the market. I think you do the analysis. They are not that strong at this point. I don't think they're going to be a threat to us in the future.\n\n---\n\nI'm asking about 2018 goals. In the past, Sika has been very well keeping up volumes during recession, relatively speaking. But the margin has been every time, very hard hit. And if I look out to 2018, I see -- I would wonder if there isn't a recession. So if there is one, then to have 10% margin, you have to move up to '13 in order to come back to '10. Is that about the picture that you're envisioning that your '15, or '16, '17 you can go up with margins? And then 1 year, you'll have a recession, you just fall down on the 10%, but not below or what does that mean that 10%?\n\n---\n\nIt's -- obviously it's a tough promise to say we're going to make 10% EBIT margin. I'm not so negative on the recession. I think if you enter into recession normally, especially your input cost will be largely decreasing. So I think we have a very good counterbalance in recessions for gross margin. And so I don't think we go to '13 was the EBIT margin. I think we are very stable in that range of 10%, and also if the markets are not so good.\n\n---\n\nBut you have almost lost on the EBIT margin 2% to 3% during a recession.\n\n---\n\nBut maybe for other reasons. I wasn't the CEO back then. So I have a hard time to comment, really. I think we have a very stable situation even, when you look at the recessions, even in the toughest year, 2009, we only lost, I think, a 9% sales or something because we have such a solid model from new build to refurbishment and in all markets active globally. So I think we have actually a very good protection against prices.\n\n---\n\nBut some of that effect we will see you get, you go a bit higher and then you fall back in the recession. No?\n\n---\n\nI don't -- I couldn't see that in my presentation if we go higher. I have to check with Adrian later what he is with planning, but I know -- honestly, I think we made quite a commitment to say we do double-digit in EBIT margins, to be honest. This is, I think, only the second time we've done that, 2007 and 2013. And we are confident we can keep up this new level. So don't push me into the sky now.\n\n---\n\nMartin Hüsler, Zurcher Kantonalbank, I have also a question on the expansion CapEx. In 2013 you also used your balance sheet for the expansion, so net debt and gearing going slightly up. What's the levels you will defend so you can maintain your A- rating with the rating agencies?\n\n---\n\nThere is -- I mean, there's certainly some more room if needed. But as you have seen, I mean, we had a very strong cash flow. And so this will be sufficient also in future to fund our CapEx.\n\n---\n\nOkay. But this year, we actually saw free cash flow after dividends negative, so you would propose for the next 2 years, this could also be possible?\n\n---\n\nI mean, there is some time effect as well. There would be a bond repayment in June next year, and we will always decide then on a case-by-case basis, whether additional financing is needed depending on the acquisition pipeline and other elements.\n\n---\n\nAll right. thank you very much. We have no more questions. And thank you, so much for coming, and I think we can continue the discussions outside with some drinks and snacks here. Thank you very much.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Michael Roost (Analysts)】\nMichael Roost from Bank am Bellevue. I just have 3 questions, if I may. First one on your guidance for 2014. The 6% to 8% corridor, is that -- that includes acquisitions, I assume? Then just a question on that because if my assumptions are right, you probably have roughly 5% to 6% positive acquisition effect assuming everything remains as is currently. And then on top of that, if I then work out the currency impact, which, okay, that should be not quite as heavy as what we saw in 2013, but it'll still be there. It still implies at least, even if you hit the top end, which is 8%, it still implies a slowdown of your organic growth. Is that -- how should I read that? Is that a little bit conservative, or -- that's my question there. And then on the second question. On your net working capital, particularly if I look at the breakdown, a lot of that seem to be focused on payables. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color on that? And then my last question is again on the personnel expenses, which reduced. Now you mentioned the positive impact of CHF 16 million on the pension side. Is there anything else that we need to be aware of because even excluding that from the overall number, it seems quite low.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nAll right. I think Adrian can take the last 2 questions. Maybe I like to answer the growth question. I think for the acquisitions, we don't see EBIT being 5% to 6% maybe. I think it will be a little lower, the contribution for this year. And the only thing I like you to consider is that we have an amazing second half 2013, especially the last quarter was influenced by the mild winter weather. So if you look at 2014 ahead, I think we will not just maybe be able to match the fourth quarter sales of 2013. So we have this exceptional situation where we were overshooting due to the very mild weather. Okay. Nevertheless, having said this, we are very positive. I think we will see a strong first half of the year. However, with all the little bumps ahead in the markets, I think we want to be rather conservative with the sales outlook for the year. It's such an early occasion.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adrian Widmer (Executives)】\nNow if I can answer that question on the networking capital. I think we have actually improved the working capital in all areas; it's inventory, receivables and payables. You also have to take into consideration that the absolute number is added by what we acquired. So there is actually an improvement in all the areas, and we are working on all the elements. This is not only story about payables.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Roost (Analysts)】\nYou see that as sustainable, the increase in payables?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adrian Widmer (Executives)】\nWe see that as sustainable, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Roost (Analysts)】\nAnd then the personnel?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nOn the personnel cost side, as I indicated, there is a number of factors, which actually influenced the net decrease. And all the translation, I mean, you have to add if you compare it to the 9% growth, so this was roughly 2.5% or close to 3% as an impact. And then and we did some structural adjustments in some markets in Southern Europe, in other markets, which we already started in 2012. So all-in-all that was a very disciplined cost management. And in terms of additional people, the increase was in the emerging markets and rather a decrease in mature markets, of course, at higher salaries.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nIn 2013, several emerging markets have seen a slowdown in growth. How did you manage it to grow so fast in almost all of these countries?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nFirst of all, I think when the crisis talks started in August with the exchange rates and so on, I think it's always very much driven from the financial industry and not from the really economy, that's my personal observation on this. And second, we have -- we built these companies up -- countries up very solid and with local people. So who understand these markets very well, and who live in these markets. So we have a very stable and solid situation, maybe compared to other businesses who go in or out with -- I don't know with expats or other people. So -- and the facts are supporting what I say, we didn't see a slowdown in our growth for the year end. Also starting off the year, we don't see a slowdown in the emerging markets. We have some hiccups in some markets. You have seen we opened a new factory in the Ukraine last year, so that's a slowing down at the moment, of course. But it's also run by local people, so -- and we have a long-term commitment and maybe we have a slowdown now until the situation clears. But we will continue to be present in this market.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Remo Rosenau (Analysts)】\nIt's Remo Rosenau from Neue Helvetische Bank. Looking a bit more forward on 2018 strategy, if you go to Slide 28, you show that the overall market is around CHF 60 billion. You have about 8% to 9% market share, you say that you have plenty of space to grow. However, if you go back -- if you do a market segmentation, and you go back about 15 years, you were at that time, almost exclusively active in the upper part of the market, in the high quality end of the market. Part of the success of Sika over the last 15 years was that you moved a bit down into the rather into the volume markets, generating strong growth, which initially, at least, had a negative impact on the margins. But you generated still much higher returns, because sales grew over-proportionally. Is now the growth Strategy 2018 based on a similar concept that you in the quality pyramid, you go rather with down into the volume markets more, even more, or do you believe that the quality segment will grow because of urbanization or is it a combination of both? And at the end of the day, what will be the impact on the margin?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nThat's a very good observation you have. I think traditionally, 10 years or 20 years ago, you always have the market positioning in the pyramid, right,  with a rather small premium segment and some mid segment of the very big business segment. If I look at our markets, I think the markets more look like a snowman with a very big belly. And the mid-segment of the market is in most markets as big as the lower segment. So I think for our strategy and you have seen our margins, how we can deliver, it's not so decisive to be somewhere in the top premium segment. You have to make solutions for the volume segments of the market. And we talked about these megacities. To build such a megacity, we want to be part in every building. We don't want to have some high engineering idea, the roof can only be like this. If the customer wants a liquid applied roof, we have to range for the liquid applied roof. If he wants to have a Sarnafil roof, we are happy to provide a Sarnafil roof. If she wants to have a green roof, which is the top of the pyramid, we're more than happy to provide the green roof. But I think what we learned in recent years is that we cannot only be successful in the volume segments of the market, we also have good margins in this segment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Remo Rosenau (Analysts)】\nOkay. Another one, the last one. You talked about the decentralized management style of Sika.  Now one of the challenges in such a concept is how can you find out which parts you can still centralize, because there are lots of cost savings in there. So how do you find out what you can sensibly centralize in such a sensibly decentralized model because that is where you can take out costs also.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nThat's the excitement of my daily job. Always find out what you give locally, and I would not say centralized, I would say what parts of the business you can globalize and you can share. And this is, first of all, a new product. We're trying to make products, which works, of course, in one country, but then the idea is we roll this product out in the region and maybe globally depending on the market situations. So our constant battle is exactly what you say, local responsibility and at the same time, we have to define global competitive advantages and processes. These are new product developments, this is our Sika brand, this is the know-how to build 10 factories in 1 year, so many areas. And it's a constant, how do we say this, argument in our company, of course, what shall be done locally, what shall be done centrally, what is a global best demonstrated practice and I like this very much, and this will continue. There's not one solution to it, there's ongoing battle and if we do 80% right, we are going to be very successful.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christian Arnold (Analysts)】\nChristian Arnold Bank Vontobel. I have 2 questions on the one side, and for the outlook 2014, you are guiding 6% to 8% growth, also organic growth included there. But at the same time, you expect margins to remain on the level of 2013, which are high, but remained there. You also commented that it also probably has a reason in the acquisitions and the new factory, which are probably we'll have a negative impact. Nevertheless, that implies no operating leverage so to say, at least as a result. And they wonder if there are some other negative points here you see, so from the raw material side, do you expect negative impact from the raw materials side? Do you expect negative impact from product mix, more concrete product versus industrial products, I should say, so maybe if you can comment on that. And then the second question would be on the long-term on your Strategy 2018, where you somewhat lowered your growth target from 8% to 10% in the past to 6% to 8% going forward, which, of course, probably is also has to be seen in combination with the absolute size of Sika. Sika today is different from Sika from some years ago. Nevertheless, I wonder if you see some other impacts there, if it's more difficult for you to do acquisitions if your own market is going slower than the past, if you can comment on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nI think for the margins, we see a stable situation on the raw material pricing. It can change every day. If the Ukraine comes into war, you already had a small impact on of the crude oil price. But nevertheless, we expect a stable situation of raw materials. For the margins, let's say, we are a bit conservative at this point because the new factories, which came into operation last year, which come into operation this year, they will not be able to make a big contribution to the bottom line in 2014. The acquisitions, I think they are well ahead of plan in the integration also here we have 1, 2 issues, which will burden the margin a bit. So I think it's a very solid comment at this point to say we are very confident to achieve the same EBIT margin as in 2013. Regarding the outlook of the strategy, I think I thought you are going to push us with the old 8% to 10%, which I think was defined back in 2005 or 2006, and then if you'll see the cost of time since in the past 8 or 9 years, that was really a target, which could not -- hardly be achieved in every year. So we took a serious review, and we believe 6% to 8% is still quite a statement, and a good growth strategy for us going forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christian Arnold (Analysts)】\nJust a follow-up for 2014. In terms of pricing, what do you expect for your pricing? Can you increase your prices?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nThis is --  we have long-term partnerships with our customers usually when we make a building, it's a 2 to 4-year project, and usually, the people we deal with at the building are also in the car industry, will, we work lifelong with these partners. So at Sika, we don't believe in very drastic and very rapid increases in sales price because we have partnerships with our customers. So for 2014, I think it's a solid position. We done our homework in 2012, and going into 2013, we are, I think, on a good level at the moment. But, of course, we it's -- as we have so many articles in every country, there's always -- pricing is an ongoing issue in the company, of course.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nBernd Pomrehn from MainFirst. Sorry if I again come back to 2018 targets. In the last 10 years, you achieved an average of local currency growth of above 9%. Last year, you achieved local currency growth of above 9%. What now really has become -- made you more becoming more cautious on the 2018 targets? Is it the organic growth component? Or do you see less acquisitions going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nI think -- when you see the this growth rate, we have, of course, we had quite some significant acquisitions in there, like Sarnafil at the end of the 2005 and also other acquisitions. We believe in the long run, we want to focus very much on organic growth and innovation. This should be around 2/3 of growth, roughly, and about 1/3 will come from acquisitions. And then again, we can argue a lot about 9% or 6% to 8%. I think we made a very good and positive statement with 6% to 8%, and as the road is a bit bumpy ahead, I think it would be not wise to make any other statements.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bernd Pomrehn (Analysts)】\nOkay. And maybe one add-on question. Is it possible to quantify the integration or restructuring cost, either -- or maybe both for last year and for this year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nOf course, it's possible, but at Sika, we don't really believe in making all these adjusted EBIT numbers and everything. We believe our company has to look for the short-term, but even more for the long term. So if you see all our investments last year, the acquisition is clear. They didn't contribute to the result in 2013. Nevertheless, we had a strong result and we don't want to come in a situation like I see with that in many cases where we make adjusted EBIT. And so I think our shareholders expect a long-term strategy and solid return numbers each year without making up any story.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nPhilip Ray from [indiscernible]. Where will you open new plants in 2014? And you have opened one for example, in Angola on last November. And which potential do you see on the longer term in Africa?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nAll right. We are very excited about Africa. We finalized in 2013, together with our strategy, we defined Africa strategy where at the moment, we have 8 factories in Africa and we have now a plan to increase this number significantly over the next 2 to 3 years. So at the moment, we are present in North Africa, we are in Morrocco, we are in Tunis, Algeria, Egypt, we have 2 plants in South Africa, one in Kenya and one in Angola. And, as you know, there are so many attractive markets in Africa, and we want to grow there now aggressively. We see Africa a little bit like the -- I don't know, the new Southeast Asia or something so, so we want to be present and accelerate our growth.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Martin Huesler (Analysts)】\nMartin Hüsler, Zurcher Kantonalbank. I have 2 questions. First one, to Latin America. You showed a good growth, but when I calculate correctly, margin came down there. Can you give us some reasons there? Is there still a transaction impact so that you have higher sales growth than local costs? And if this is the case, what is about the difference between share of local cost and share of local sales. And your question turns to your new guidance or targets. I was just wondering why you changed from an EBITDA target to an EBIT target?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nAll right. I'll take the second one and then Adrian takes the first question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adrian Widmer (Executives)】\nI'll go with the first one.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nNo, I'll take the first one, you take the second one. I think the EBITDA is very clear. We believe that the in a very low capital intense industry. As you see even we make 10 factories, our investments is a bit over CHF 150 million so this is very exciting for us and very exciting for our growth strategy. That's why we believe we should rather focus on the bottom results and not make some EBITDA, which doesn't make a big difference in our case.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adrian Widmer (Executives)】\nYour question on Latin America. I think first statement, we have very, very solid margins in Latin America still. I mean, they have come down a bit. This is clear. And there was indeed some impact, let's say currency related due to the fact that a lot of the raw materials in Latin America are either purchased in dollars or in other currency and some other impacts on the currency side, which gave a bit of a dent on the margin. So on the raw materials side, there is quite a share of, let's say, foreign-denominated cost, and on the operating expenses, most of it is local. So it's not a huge impact, but this year combined with some of the hotspots that were mentioned before, Venezuela and Argentina, that just had an impact on the overall efficiency.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Dominik Meyer (Analysts)】\nDominic Meyer, Bank Vontobel. I have actually 2 questions. The first one is again with regard to growth. An important factor or driver for you is this structural growth, for example, new application, changes from welding to bonding. Can you maybe give some indication what the contribution is of structural growth in the past than going forward? And then second question, could you also give some guidance on CapEx, split up in maintenance and expansion CapEx?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nAll right. I think structural growth is not so easy to always differentiate because every product which we develop is normally a better product if enhanced performance for the customer. So then you don't know is it now a structural growth because the adhesive to bond the car or the adhesive to make the new high-strength concrete is a structural growth or not. So it's quite difficult for me to answer the question. But I think, as a pointed out, we have plenty of room for the structural growth because of these 3 megatrends, which I presented, we need to have better solutions in the future. So -- but difficult to answer the structural growth question because I think most of our new products are related to enhanced performance.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Dominik Meyer (Analysts)】\nJust if you give a range, is it 1/3, is it 1/5 or...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nVery hard to say. I would really say you can go a bit with the market what I said. Maybe these megatrends they lead to 2% to 3% growth each year, so maybe 50-50 or something, or maybe around this organic growth rate. The second question was with the investments. I think we've made a lot of improvement in Sika in the past 2 years to standardize our investment process and to make -- to specify the equipment used in a better way, so we lower the necessary investment very significantly. This is why, I think we have quite a reasonable investment number for 2013, and I believe it will maintain in that -- on that level.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Dominik Meyer (Analysts)】\n[indiscernible] overall that is split up in maintenance and...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nAll right -- so we go from 6 factories in '12 to 10 in '13, to maybe 8 factories in '14, and then a lot depends, of course, on the market dynamics. So '15, I cannot tell. '15, I still expect we're going to have 6 to 8 new factories in the emerging markets. So we, of course, try to focus on new investments rather than maintenance. But it will keep around similar like we showed now the past 2 years, I would think.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nAnders Borgen. [ph] I would like to ask a question on the supply sides, so the new supplies. Can you make some comments what the situation currently is there in terms of know how much they try to increase the prices, how much capacity is around and how much you and your sites still can optimize the purchasing situation, be it centralized or more reasonable or packaged or which supplier just to get a feeling a bit how this will develop going into 2014?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nWe are --  they always try to increase the price. The question is, are they able to? We are quite confident that 2014, we will see a flat development. We have a certain factors pushing it. I think the load capacity in the chemical, raw materials industry is not very good at this point. So even with higher oil prices, the ability to increase prices is, I think, limited for them. On the other hand, what we drive very much in Sika is that we do global sourcing of raw materials, something we didn't do really 10 years ago. But now come with all our push into China, into Korea, Japan, also into Latin America, we, of course, source more and more raw materials locally, which gives us a bit of leverage against big suppliers.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nAnd maybe second question on the gross margin side. Can you give us a feeling what the pricing in 2013 or what -- at least if you don't want to comment on pricing, at least with the mix price effect, which was a positive, I must say, understood was in 2013 on gross margin?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nWe had a slightly positive pricing effect in 2013. So the actions which we took in 2012 to bring the margins back up, they also went through into 2013.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Patrick Appenzeller (Analysts)】\nPatrick Appenzeller, Helvea Baader Bank. I have questions related to gross and margins again, but these are -- this time, rather on a short-term view. You mentioned the tough comparison you might phase in the second half, but on the other hand, you will phase very favorable comparison in the first. I mean, we have now an extremely mild winter against a very cold winter last seen in Europe, which still is a most important for you and U.S. might be similar, but overall, must be quite a significant impact, especially on the first quarter, we also will have Easter ship[ph], the shift in the eastern, which will impact Q1 and Q2. And on the margin side, you had on the fourth quarter, the 13% EBIT margin, which is the highest ever achieved in the fourth quarter, which is seasonally low, and this time seemed to have almost no season impact. So from this 13%, it's hard to believe that you will let's say at least to be stable in the first half-year with certain percent, so I would assume that in the first half-year here, it's quite a bit of positive momentum don't forget the flooding in the second half, which also will provide a likely positive comparison.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nI fully agree with you. I think we're going to see a solid first half. I think we will see even a very good growth in the first quarter with everything you said and with the good weather conditions. We have a good momentum in the first quarter, of course. However, as you mentioned, the fourth quarter 2013 was very exceptional, and if you ask me today if I can be flat in the fourth quarter, I will sign today for the same sales volumes. So you see, we have to make all growth in 2014. We need to make them in the first 3 quarters, fourth quarter will, I don't think we will able to grow.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Patrick Appenzeller (Analysts)】\nIs there any indication so far in the year you can give us for feeling about this impact of the weather in the first quarters, in the first 2 months? Is there any flavor you can give us here?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nIt's a very warm out there. So you see building activities everywhere and you see me also with a smile on the face. So I think we -- again, we're going to have a very good start of the year. But please don't overestimate this if we talk again in April and I don't know the results yet, but if we have a very positive sales, don't overestimate them. We will have more difficulties in the second half.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nMark [indiscernible]. A very simple question. You still like have many companies, especially in the Arabia and China and emerging markets as such where you don't own 100% is it a target to grow up to 100% to really fully consolidate them or what is your strategy in that context? And what impact could that have on the top line growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nI think traditionally, we are someone who wants to own the company. You see this except for the Middle East where we have a joint venture partner for many, many years. Normally, we own the company in China if it is only 1 or 2 companies at least there have the majority share. And in Japan, we have a 50-50 joint venture for the automotive industry, so we only do joint ventures, I think, in very exceptional cases. We believe with our growth model in Sika, especially with our company culture, it's better to own the company 100%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nAnd then maybe second question concerning the innovation. You mentioned the 73 patents that you won last year. How does that compare with the past? And do you plan -- is that going to be the decisive competitive advantage in a still very fragmented markets where smaller companies do not have the power to really come up with the same innovation grade?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nI believe so. I think the patent is really something we started on a professional level, maybe just 10 or 12 years ago. And the 73 patents, I think, is about the same level as the year before. There was a big increase in patents, of course, over the last 10 years. We believe it's going to be a very strong competitive advantage in the future. Today in the chemical industry, half of the patents are written in China. And despite many discussions about patent protection in China, they are the ones writing the patents. So to protect your company's future, I think in our industry, you have to have patents in the future.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nIf I may, just last question concerning the market structure in 2018 or maybe some years down the road. You mentioned the top 5 players have a quarter of the market. How is that going to look like then and how many smaller competitors will have to disappear due to the lack of economics of scale and other factors?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nI don't want to comment on the other competitors. I don't know what they are going to do. I think we're going to move along.  We're going to be the strongest company in 2018. I would expect maybe we're going to have a Chinese company entering this top 5 circle. It's possible. We don't see that at the moment, but it's possible that in 5 years, we have a strong emerging competitor from China.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nAnd in there is no pressure from like backwards integration or forward integration of some of your content providers, i.e. chemical companies that try to move into the Sika direction?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nI think you are a better judge of this, you'll see that some the chemical raw material suppliers are doing attempts or trying to go into the front end of the market. I think you do the analysis. They are not that strong at this point. I don't think they're going to be a threat to us in the future.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nI'm asking about 2018 goals. In the past, Sika has been very well keeping up volumes during recession, relatively speaking. But the margin has been every time, very hard hit. And if I look out to 2018, I see -- I would wonder if there isn't a recession. So if there is one, then to have 10% margin, you have to move up to '13 in order to come back to '10. Is that about the picture that you're envisioning that your '15, or '16, '17 you can go up with margins? And then 1 year, you'll have a recession, you just fall down on the 10%, but not below or what does that mean that 10%?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nIt's -- obviously it's a tough promise to say we're going to make 10% EBIT margin. I'm not so negative on the recession. I think if you enter into recession normally, especially your input cost will be largely decreasing. So I think we have a very good counterbalance in recessions for gross margin. And so I don't think we go to '13 was the EBIT margin. I think we are very stable in that range of 10%, and also if the markets are not so good.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nBut you have almost lost on the EBIT margin 2% to 3% during a recession.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nBut maybe for other reasons. I wasn't the CEO back then. So I have a hard time to comment, really. I think we have a very stable situation even, when you look at the recessions, even in the toughest year, 2009, we only lost, I think, a 9% sales or something because we have such a solid model from new build to refurbishment and in all markets active globally. So I think we have actually a very good protection against prices.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nBut some of that effect we will see you get, you go a bit higher and then you fall back in the recession. No?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nI don't -- I couldn't see that in my presentation if we go higher. I have to check with Adrian later what he is with planning, but I know -- honestly, I think we made quite a commitment to say we do double-digit in EBIT margins, to be honest. This is, I think, only the second time we've done that, 2007 and 2013. And we are confident we can keep up this new level. So don't push me into the sky now.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Martin Huesler (Analysts)】\nMartin Hüsler, Zurcher Kantonalbank, I have also a question on the expansion CapEx. In 2013 you also used your balance sheet for the expansion, so net debt and gearing going slightly up. What's the levels you will defend so you can maintain your A- rating with the rating agencies?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nThere is -- I mean, there's certainly some more room if needed. But as you have seen, I mean, we had a very strong cash flow. And so this will be sufficient also in future to fund our CapEx.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Martin Huesler (Analysts)】\nOkay. But this year, we actually saw free cash flow after dividends negative, so you would propose for the next 2 years, this could also be possible?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adrian Widmer (Executives)】\nI mean, there is some time effect as well. There would be a bond repayment in June next year, and we will always decide then on a case-by-case basis, whether additional financing is needed depending on the acquisition pipeline and other elements.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jan Jenisch (Executives)】\nAll right. thank you very much. We have no more questions. And thank you, so much for coming, and I think we can continue the discussions outside with some drinks and snacks here. Thank you very much.",

As you know, we had already published our preliminary results on January 16. What we have here for you today is then the full set of data and lots of interesting details about the year 2013. \r\nWe will start our meeting today with a message from our CEO, Stefan Heidenreich, and I'm happy that he is here today because he had to undergo complex knee surgery not too long ago, still is not mobile and will need some more time for recovery. So I'm really glad you're here, and you're going to talk about the progress that Beiersdorf has made in the year 2013 based on the Blue Agenda. We'll come to that in a second.\r\nOur CFO, Ulrich Schmidt, is going to speak about the financial details of the year 2013. And then at the end of the meeting, as always, we're going to have a question-and-answer here with you. \r\nSo I suggest we start now and I hand over to Stefan Heidenreich.\n\n---\n\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Beiersdorf's full year financial analyst meeting. Thank you for your interest in our company's performance in financial year 2013. Together with my colleague, Ulrich Schmidt, I will now give you an update on the group's financial performance in 2013, as well as an overview on the operational and strategic development of Beiersdorf. \r\nLadies and gentlemen, 2013 was an important and successful year for Beiersdorf. The group made gains in market share, increased sales and improved its earnings. Beiersdorf is back on a sustainable growth track.\r\nIn 2012, we developed and started with our Blue Agenda. In 2013, we further deeply implemented the Blue Agenda within the organization. The results so far, our brands are back, we are gaining market shares in our core categories, we are significantly expanding our presence in the emerging markets and we are strengthening our position in Europe. In short, we are pleased with the 2013 results. We are seeing a continuous, sustainable upward trend for Beiersdorf.\r\nTurning to the financials. We increased organic group sales by 7.2%. In nominal terms, the growth rate was at the level of 1.7%, as a result primarily of the strong euro. \r\nNet sales for the year were EUR 6.141 billion, even excluding special factors improved by 10.7% from EUR 735 million to EUR 814 million, representing an EBIT margin, excluding special factors, of 13.2% compared to last year's 12.2%. \r\nProfit after tax, excluding special factors, rose from EUR 480 million to EUR 537 million. The executive and supervisory boards will propose to the shareholders' meeting a dividend of EUR 0.70 per share.\r\nTo the Consumer segment. In 2013, the Consumer business segment recorded organic sales growth of 7.0%. In nominal terms, sales rose by 1.1% from EUR 5.048 billion to EUR 5.103 billion. Each of the group's core brands contributed to this positive development, with NIVEA delivering 7.5% growth; Eucerin, 11.5%; and La Prairie, 7.5%. \r\nEBIT, excluding special factors, saw an increase of 5.2% to EUR 638 million, representing an improvement in the EBIT margin, again excluding special factors, from 12.0% to 12.5%.\r\nTurning now to the regions. In Europe, the business recorded an organic sales growth of 0.9%. In Western Europe, for the first time since 2008, we were able to deliver sales growth. In our home country of Germany, we saw a very pleasing performance. We also saw significant sales in the United Kingdom and Spain. And in Southern Europe, there were initial signs of recovery. In Eastern Europe, sales remained more or less at last year's level, with a slight decline of minus 0.4%. The Americas region was able to deliver strong organic sales growth of 9.0%. North America saw growth of 4.6%, and Latin America, 11.4%, with especially strong growth in Brazil. Most of the other Latin American markets also delivered good rates.\r\nWe also recorded strong sales growth in Africa/Asia/Australia region. Organic sales increased by 19%. All of the markets in the region achieved significant growth uplift, in particular, China, India and Japan.\r\nTo tesa. For the reporting period, the tesa business segment increased organic sales by 8.5%. Nominal sales rose by 4.7%, from EUR 992 million in the previous year to EUR 1.038 billion. \r\nEBIT, excluding special factors, moved up from EUR 129 million to EUR 176 million, an increase of 36.3%, representing an improved EBIT margin of 16.9% compared to last year's 13.0%. \r\nAll regions were successful, with especially strong growth rates in the U.S. and Asia. Key growth areas were the electronics and automotive industries. This strong performance once again demonstrates the sustainability and strength of tesa's innovation powers.\r\nLadies and gentlemen, these positive developments result from the strategic decisions made in 2012, laid down in our Blue Agenda and systematically implemented in 2013. All the business activities, priorities, focus on strengthening our brands, first and foremost, NIVEA; second, increasing our innovation power; and third, systematically expanding our presence in the emerging markets while strengthening our position in Europe.\r\nTo brands. Beiersdorf has a portfolio of outstanding and globally successful brands. Above all, we are recharging the iconic NIVEA brand. Our disciplined and focused brand strategy has enabled us to sharpen the brand profile and, thereby, win market shares. \r\nOur new brand logo and new packaging designs for NIVEA significantly increased brand recognition among NIVEA consumers. This has been demonstrated by several representative consumer panels. Recently and importantly, NIVEA was again voted the most popular brand among Germans. \r\nInnovation. The new products we have launched on the market are resonating well with our consumers. New products such as body, In-Shower; face, Cellular Anti-Age; and deo, Stress Protect generated significant market momentum in 2013 in all launch markets. For example, NIVEA In-Shower was one of the best sellers in the body category, already in the first year. We also saw growth in the face category, mainly driven by the launch of NIVEA Cellular Anti-Age. \r\nTo markets. As part of the company's strategic development, we have sharpened our focus on the emerging markets without losing sight of our traditional markets. In 2013, we successfully expanded our position in the emerging markets and improved our structures. These regions now account for more -- and this is for the first time, than 50% of the Consumer business segment total sales, to be precise, 52%. The construction of new factories and regional development labs in China, Mexico and India are important steps towards better identifying the specific regional consumer needs and integrating these into our expanding product portfolio. To be a little bit even more concrete, our new development center in the Chinese city of Wuhan is already operational. Our new Mexican plant, a big plant, and regional lab will be completed in summer 2014. And in India, we're planning a new production facility with more than 300 employees. That is expected to be completed by 2015.\r\nTo the outlook. Ladies and gentlemen, let me close my presentation by giving some guidance on 2014. In 2014, we will systematically continue our profitable growth path on the basis of our Blue Agenda. We will also benefit from a slight recovery in the global economy, which we are expecting in the industrialized nations. By contrast, we expect the developing and emerging countries to see weaker performance than in the previous years. \r\nFor 2014, we forecast for the Consumer business segment sales growth in the excess of 4% to 6%. The operating EBIT margin should be slightly above this year's level. As regards tesa, we expect sales to slightly outperform the market, which is forecasted to grow by 2% to 3%. Tesa's EBIT margin from operations is expected to be slightly below the prior year's level. Based on the forecast for the 2 business segments, we expect the group sales to grow by 4% to 6%. The consolidated EBIT margin from operations should slightly exceed the prior-year figure. \r\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention.\n\n---\n\nGood afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'm happy to present some more financials. So, first of all, give us a lot of credit. So let's have a look to the facts and figures. \r\nHere, we see the development of the group. If you have a look towards the like-for-like, sales of 7.2%, you'll see that we have a devaluation effect of 5.5%. It's coming out of 3 factors. First of all, you'll be aware that we have the strong euro, so that rest of the world translate into this euro, that's the first effect. Secondly, we have strong devaluation of a number of emerging market currencies, especially with the Indian rupee and South African rand. We have seen it also in Brazilian real. And thirdly, we had a substantial effect from Venezuela because we were applying actual exchange rates last year. And that's a very conservative approach that took some sales in nominal terms.\r\nIf you look to the EBIT and profit after tax, you have a difference between reported and those excluded special factors. What have been the special factors? First of all, last year, we had EUR 37 million coming from restructuring of China and coming also out of impairment calculation in Turkey. We have increased our share to 100%. This year, we had a rather normal -- this year 2013, we had a rather normal year, without a lot of extraordinary factors, so that we have EUR 43 million better result in extraordinary.\r\nIf we look to the different regions, you have seen part of that slide already, so we had a very balanced situation in Europe. We're growing our market share slightly. We had a mix situation in Americas, first of all, the single-digit growth in North America, above the market and strongly above the market in Latin America. Now we have been affected by the devaluations of the currencies in Latin America. Like I was mentioning, if we have excluded Venezuela, we would have seen more than 15% of growth in Latin America. \r\nWe have very strong growth in Africa, Near East, Asia. The countries have been extremely well in terms of growth had been India, Middle East and South Africa. We have done good growth in Japan and in China.\r\nWe are especially satisfied seeing that the gross margin are stable. First of all, we need to make you aware that we still depend on our production network in Europe, which means that we invoice in euro to part of the regions. That compensated that. Secondly, it's also compensating the stronger growth of emerging markets that normally have lower gross margins than Europe. And thirdly, we have also had an effect from the Venezuela reporting, where we had reported high gross margins in the past using official exchange rates and now had applied market rates.\r\nWe come to the share of sales and EBIT. Emerging markets now, as you see, is contributing 31% of the EBIT and has a steady development. Together with our strong growth, we are gaining more #1 and #2 positions. We are also increasing our market share and, therefore, we are generating natural profitability in those markets and that's a trend that we are seeing also for the next years.\r\nSo in tesa, we have a number of special applications. We called it projects, and also our calls that we've had over the year. That's an example. We can see in electronics, we had a number of applications in tesa that was in smartphones, tablets, MP3 players or PDA and the number of applications in these machineries. If you're interested in that, I have taken a folder that will show you that in a deal like that, you have up to 12 applications for tesa, and that's a substantial business. Now it's difficult to forecast what business will be over this year, next year, because normally, the lifespan of tools like that is rather 12 months -- 6 months, 12 months. So it depends on the tenders that are going, to which extent you can qualify for a tender.  \r\nWhat we have seen is a steep increase in our investments. The biggest project we are having is a big Mexico plant. We'll have production in that plant in first quarter, start of this year. We'll also bring over more and more production volumes from North America to that plant. We'll close down the old plant in Mexico City in the first half of next year. \r\nSecondly, we have a new headquarter for tesa that will open in 2015. It's also having a place for maybe 1,000 tesa people who used to be in that area of the town.\r\nThe guidance, you've seen already. Mentioning this, I'd like to make you aware that, again, like we've done in Venezuela, we'll do a very conservative approach this year for Argentina and we'll apply actual exchange rates for Argentina when calculating like-for-like, and that will, of course, have an effect like we have had an effect applying those rates already in 2013. Now we'll have that effect for 2014 as well. \r\nThat's the end of my presentation.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Jens Geissler (Executives)】\nGood afternoon, and welcome to Beiersdorf's Analyst Meeting. It's our pleasure to have you all here in our headquarters in Hamburg today. As you know, we had already published our preliminary results on January 16. What we have here for you today is then the full set of data and lots of interesting details about the year 2013. \r\nWe will start our meeting today with a message from our CEO, Stefan Heidenreich, and I'm happy that he is here today because he had to undergo complex knee surgery not too long ago, still is not mobile and will need some more time for recovery. So I'm really glad you're here, and you're going to talk about the progress that Beiersdorf has made in the year 2013 based on the Blue Agenda. We'll come to that in a second.\r\nOur CFO, Ulrich Schmidt, is going to speak about the financial details of the year 2013. And then at the end of the meeting, as always, we're going to have a question-and-answer here with you. \r\nSo I suggest we start now and I hand over to Stefan Heidenreich.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Stefan Heidenreich (Executives)】\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Beiersdorf's full year financial analyst meeting. Thank you for your interest in our company's performance in financial year 2013. Together with my colleague, Ulrich Schmidt, I will now give you an update on the group's financial performance in 2013, as well as an overview on the operational and strategic development of Beiersdorf. \r\nLadies and gentlemen, 2013 was an important and successful year for Beiersdorf. The group made gains in market share, increased sales and improved its earnings. Beiersdorf is back on a sustainable growth track.\r\nIn 2012, we developed and started with our Blue Agenda. In 2013, we further deeply implemented the Blue Agenda within the organization. The results so far, our brands are back, we are gaining market shares in our core categories, we are significantly expanding our presence in the emerging markets and we are strengthening our position in Europe. In short, we are pleased with the 2013 results. We are seeing a continuous, sustainable upward trend for Beiersdorf.\r\nTurning to the financials. We increased organic group sales by 7.2%. In nominal terms, the growth rate was at the level of 1.7%, as a result primarily of the strong euro. \r\nNet sales for the year were EUR 6.141 billion, even excluding special factors improved by 10.7% from EUR 735 million to EUR 814 million, representing an EBIT margin, excluding special factors, of 13.2% compared to last year's 12.2%. \r\nProfit after tax, excluding special factors, rose from EUR 480 million to EUR 537 million. The executive and supervisory boards will propose to the shareholders' meeting a dividend of EUR 0.70 per share.\r\nTo the Consumer segment. In 2013, the Consumer business segment recorded organic sales growth of 7.0%. In nominal terms, sales rose by 1.1% from EUR 5.048 billion to EUR 5.103 billion. Each of the group's core brands contributed to this positive development, with NIVEA delivering 7.5% growth; Eucerin, 11.5%; and La Prairie, 7.5%. \r\nEBIT, excluding special factors, saw an increase of 5.2% to EUR 638 million, representing an improvement in the EBIT margin, again excluding special factors, from 12.0% to 12.5%.\r\nTurning now to the regions. In Europe, the business recorded an organic sales growth of 0.9%. In Western Europe, for the first time since 2008, we were able to deliver sales growth.

Mentioning this, I'd like to make you aware that, again, like we've done in Venezuela, we'll do a very conservative approach this year for Argentina and we'll apply actual exchange rates for Argentina when calculating like-for-like, and that will, of course, have an effect like we have had an effect applying those rates already in 2013. Now we'll have that effect for 2014 as well. \r\nThat's the end of my presentation.",
      "transcript_text3": "Okay. So these were the strategy update and the review of our full year numbers. Well, it looks like the microphones are ready, so please go ahead if you have any questions. Yes.\n\n---\n\nA couple of questions, please. First of all, we've seen the margin development in Consumer. Can you talk a little bit, as well, about the trends in Western Europe and North America? On the subject of North America, you have said in the past, Mr. Heidenreich, that you wanted to fix the other problems first and then think about North America. Have you started thinking about North America yet? And can you maybe remind us how big Venezuela and Argentina are of your Latin American sales?\n\n---\n\nLet's start with Western Europe. And as such, I mean, I think we are very, very pleased in Western Europe. It was next to the west to the emerging market where we saw growth early on, Western Europe is now quite nicely growing. When you all, I guess, get the Nielsen numbers from quarter 4 and the Nielsen numbers in January, and if I recall from the numbers, there's no one growing except 1 company, which is Beiersdorf, in our field. And we're not growing 1% or 2%, we're growing close to 10%. So we are very pleased in Europe. Things are turning around there. And margin-wise, it's always the same. Once you grow in this business, you also make nice margins. So the margin development in Europe is still strong despite all the factors of pricing, of trade, of what can we count on. But it's overall in a very good development. We always had margin, but we've also gone back to growth. I think North America is a similar one and, it's such that we are finding our way better to growth. Again, I will, because I'm not talking normally for numbers, when you look at the Nielsen numbers, which came out for Jan, Feb for North America, I mean, our competitions are heavily decreasing and the only one growing big time is Beiersdorf. Have we found a way in North America? No, not a big way. But we have found a very nice way, I think, that we can grow in the singles. And we also, for the first time, are making nice margins. We already made nice margins in 2013, and that trend will continue. So it's not the big solution, but I think we changed the strategy dramatically. I will not tell more, but it's a different strategy than the year before and that seems to work so far. We also changed management and all the rest of it, but North America, I think, is at least in its size of what it is on a good trend.\n\n---\n\nYes, regarding Latin America, we have a very unstable situation in Venezuela at the moment and so also open how the government will decide how to handle foreign exchange and imports. So it's rather weak, to give a forecast there. Argentina, we are having just seen a 20% devaluation. We would see some further devaluation over the year. Still, we think this one is a healthy one because Argentina had been over-evaluated in the past. It made imports very expensive for the economy. So we think this one is a good one. In total, the 2 countries are standing for about 15% of our sales for Latin America.\n\n---\n\nSo you could also argue, Eva, why we did this. I think, again, we are very conservative when it comes to our approach to the business and I think also there, our company's well ahead of other companies. We took everything ahead of Venezuela, which, as you know, was quite substantial in our books, but that's gone. And now we also took -- take ahead of the crowd, the Argentina bid. If it doesn't come, even better. If it comes, we are prepared. But I mean, we are very clear with these growth rates. We also have the luxury to take certain things now.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So we jump to Harold, please.\n\n---\n\nThree questions, please. First of all, on supply chain and R&D. I mean, so you've got a big plant opening in the summer in Mexico. You've expanded your R&D in China. EUR 30 million in India is quite a substantial number. I mean, how crucial to your just gross margin developments are all these investments going forward? Is it kind of catch-up to what it should have been or is it kind of forward thinking? Second question is on tesa. I mean, it's -- I don't know what words to use to describe its performance, excellent, good, brilliant, whatever. But if the tesa team came to you, Stefan, and said, \"Right, actually, we'd like to spend EUR 0.5 billion buying another business because we're quite good at managing adhesives,\" what would your response be, given your kind of wider group, longer-term ambitions? And the second -- and the third and final point is, products are the lifeblood of the business. We saw some -- some interesting launches in 2013. You keep telling us 2015 is the better year. So does nothing happen in '14? The only reason I say that is because clearly, there aren't any slides or names of new products or initiatives for us to see.\n\n---\n\nI'll let Ulrich do the second. Let's start with the easier one. I'm not showing you anything, and I will not talk about it even to the moment it is on the market. We have -- I think when you look at our categories, the 6 key categories, I think we have shown, and market share has proved, our innovations have really hit the market big time. And there's so much leeway still in the innovation that we have, in the first half year, we have some innovations, but I would call them in the first half year, very important innovation in key fields of my categories where I said we need to get a little better. For example, we launched 2 important lines with -- already, I shouldn't say this, but we launched 2 important lines, 1 on sensitive skin for face and 1 on sensitive skin for men. And both of them very important lines with nice inside [indiscernible] concept, why is it so important? Because for NIVEA, that's the core of the business, sensitive skin. We deliberately put in some categories, the big hits, into the second half. Why? Because we simply have so much growth and leeway on the innovations from 2013 that we still have to focus on bringing In-Shower home, Cellular home and Stress Protect to the full extent. So other than that, you will not hear from me, but I have more luxury problems than I have problems of which innovations I see for this and that, so the pipeline is still full. The -- now I'll let you first go on tesa, and then I answer Harold's first question, because that was an interesting question.\n\n---\n\nSo I'll give you an answer to the EUR 500 million. So it's a good question, but it's not easy to answer. First of all, we think tesa had done a very solid way in the last 20 years after doing heavy restructuring in the '90s, sort of rebuilding one step up to the other, had done a number of pruning in the commodity business, now upgrading and upgrading. So in principle, I would agree that in the moment, it could not be a bad time to commit an investment like that. So in principle, yes. How do I see the tesa management? Tesa management is very cautious. So when they see EUR 500 million compared to the EUR 1 billion, so it's very sizable. So they might hesitate. But I would think, if they came, then they would have thought a lot about it and they would think they can do it and then I would also think they can do it.\n\n---\n\nTo the first question, why did I say a little bit ironic? This is such an important category. I think that is another cornerstone of our Blue Agenda, and it's much further than a couple of plans and developments. I completely believe that we should go more regional and even more decentralization. My competitive friends are all claiming centralization on the core of it, and I think that's good. We go the other way around. Why? Because there is no such thing as one skin care, just does not exist. If I want to successfully conquer India, I have to have a plant, I have to have an R&D there, I need to have my marketing, I need to have my sales, I need the full nine yards to compete fully. I cannot do that with a plant in Hamburg, I cannot do that with an R&D lab from Hamburg. Sounds relatively simple, yet we were, for years and years, in a very centralized mode. I go the other way around. The second part of your question is a question which I will answer like that. If you just take a plant, a lab and all the rest of it to it and compare that cost-wise to the product sourcing out of a European center, even if you take the goodies of Texas or globalize in it, you would not make a huge margin gain. You would not. Some markets are different, India, for example. But in general, probably not. But I'm not building these plants for products which I have in Europe. I'm building these plants -- for example, like in India, we're coming with fully new assortments which we have never done before, assortments which really not talking to the A class of consumers, which talking to the B and C class. You have to see that mostly what you see in the financial analyst conferences, you see the -- also what you see on the shelf are products for the A class. You're not talking to the B class and we are not talking to the C class. If we go to Brazil, we go China or India. Products for EUR 0.10, products for EUR 0.05, products for EUR 0.04 or EUR 0.06 or EUR 0.075 needs different skill set, need different insights, and that's what we're after. Now that's a long quest, of course, but that's the only way to win in these markets. I think that if NIVEA stays where it is, it will become a super-premium brand in a lot of markets. So we have to go down, like in Europe, we're not considered premium, whereas in most of the emerging markets or a lot, we are considered super premium, super expensive. So that's the way we're going, so I will drive that company much more regional, much more decentralized and, yes, that's very different to my friends. But that is where we see the chance and where we also see the chances in winning with the consumers. So it's a very important question, yes?\n\n---\n\nGael from MainFirst. Two questions for me, from my side. The first one, when you talk about decentralizing the super chain and the whole organization and understanding that from historical background, you tended to export a lot out of Western Europe to these countries. Can you give us an idea in terms, for instance, of your volume or your revenues, how much of that is actually sourced from Western Europe into the emerging markets? My second question would be on tesa. Is there any reason why there, they seem to be a bit cautious on the guidance on EBIT margin and slightly below what they achieved for 2013? And my last question, which is also related to the decentralization of the organization, there was a significant spike in terms of your CapEx in '13. What is your expectation for '14?\n\n---\n\nSo starting with the export volume from Western Europe to emerging markets. So out of emerging markets, cost of goods sold perhaps have 20% to 30% coming from Western Europe. That's based on -- oh, actually the assortment is especially coming from special products, face care products. We used to have plants in Latin America, in Mexico, Brazil and in Chile for the deodorant product, personal care products and basic skincare products. We have today already plants in China, in Thailand for the local products. But as was mentioned already, the formulas are very similar to what we have in Western Europe. Regarding tesa, we have had special effects in tesa in the year 2012. We had the closedown of 1 company that used to produce labels. It was a low-margin business in Switzerland. We closed it down, had an extraordinary loss of EUR 12 million. Last year, we had to close down a plant in Singapore also, a pvc low-margin business. But because of the valuable land, we had an extraordinary profit of EUR 18 million. So if you look to the profit of tesa, there's a swing of EUR 30 million, if you compare 2012 to '13. Now when we normalize the tesa profitability, profitability is rather 16% that we have had last year operationally and that would we expected also this year.\n\n---\n\nOn the last question, if the decentralization gains traction and we're playing with a lot of formats to make that successful because there's not 1 format. Mexico is a huge plant, a monster, which will not only serve Latin America, it will also serve North America. So that's a big one, probably one of the biggest we ever built outside -- definitely, the biggest we ever built outside of Europe. India, as I said, is a very different plant. It's basically there for really making the EUR 0.05 or EUR 0.10 products and has a huge expansion space if it is successful. It's a very different technology I'm looking for. And in China, we're also building. Now if these models prove, then depending on what the market needs -- and I have a lot of ideas where I need people, where I need teams, then we will further roll out, which inevitably then means more CapEx, more spending and, probably more important, investments. And that always becomes a question of growth and margin, it hasn't been asked but maybe I'd do that in front of everyone, I go on growth. Our #1 currency is market shares. As long as we gain market shares as we do today, we will further put that off. Margins will come. You see the margins, margin 1, it's a 63% margin, don't worry. But as long as I see that innovation in markets, which I can hit home -- and don't forget in the emerging markets, we are still relatively small in some markets, we will invest. If the teams prove that and it's successful, we will do that. So that's -- and that will still go on for years. So it's not like it will change next year or so on. We have a very clear understanding of where we want to go and we see still a lot of potential on NIVEA, Eucerin and also La Prairie. So we will hit home.\n\n---\n\nSo we go to Celine, please.\n\n---\n\nThree questions. The first one is on zone AAA, can we maybe go a bit deeper in terms of the performance on Japan, China and Thailand. I understand Japan has been very strong. If you can mention what's the outlook there and how you see that continuing? Equally for China, there seem to have been a step-up in performance now for a few years in an environment that -- where we see lower growth in the Tier 1, Tier 2 cities, how we should be looking at China? And then I asked about Thailand because I think you have quite a sizable business there, given what's happening in that market. My second question is, just to remind you, at some point you mentioned that you see an opportunity for margin in Western Europe, but there is some pressure from the retail end as well as price pressure. If you can elaborate a bit more on that. And then lastly, to some of the, I mean, the question some of which you have alluded just now, but would it be fair, balancing margin and top line to that, we see the margin potential still coming from Western Europe but probably if I look at zone AAA, where you still should put your margin benefit from China becoming breakeven this year, beyond that, your focus will be probably reinvestment and, therefore, should we see Europe, North America as the margin driver and maybe emerging market being flat margin, if that makes sense?\n\n---\n\nYes. So let's start with Japan. We have had very successful launches and brand support over the last years. We have strong gain in market share in Japan, comes together with the development of the market. You know that the government had been very pushy and had very inflationary supply of money, so that was helping the market in Japan. Finally, we launched shower products in Japan. All 3 factors together generated, clearly, double-digit growth in Japan. The same was true for China, that we had double-digit growth in the NIVEA business, as well as hair care business. We have reported already about launches of last year, while we have been successful and was meeting our expectation. Thailand was also doing good double-digit growth. So overall, Asia is in good shape. We had -- regarding the price situation in Europe, yes, there is a concentration of trade. On the other hand, that's not a recent development. That used to be the case in the last 10, 20 years. There is no trade company that's dominating or is very strongly growing. You have normally local heroes that dominate their local market and they try to play power games. We're used to that, on the other hand, we have a very strong market share and very strong brand. And I think that's a precondition for resisting. So we have had not big changes last year compared to what we had. What was helping was innovation. If you have good innovation, normally, you don't have too much fight with the trade. The question regarding the margin development in Asia, Africa and China overall, and in total, you've seen that we have double-digit EBIT ratios. Meanwhile, in all of that area, China still has negative result last -- this year, 2014, we are forecasted to be breakeven. We would then develop over the next years, together with the market share, also in China. We think that, especially in those markets where we have a very healthy market share, we also have a fair chance to grow profitability closer to Europe, while we want to keep our profitability that we have in Europe actually.\n\n---\n\nAnd we had a nice slide there, I think it's Page 18, where you can see that we're growing our EBIT disproportionately in emerging markets. That actually illustrates the progress we are making right now.\n\n---\n\nSo another question from Pinar.\n\n---\n\nThis is Pinar from Merrill Lynch. So my first question is, your top 3 brands: NIVEA, Eucerin and La Prairie, they're all growing organically above 7.5%, which means some of your other brands are dragging the overall growth down. So do you think these other brands can catch up with the rest of the group? Or if they don't, would you consider divesting them? And then my second question is regarding your cash policy. So on one hand, I see a conservative cash policy. You didn't raise your dividends. On the other hand, your working capital levels have deteriorated as a percentage of sales. So I guess the question is twofold. Why didn't your dividends grow when your earnings were growing and you had a good cash balance? And now what is your focus on -- whether you have a strong focus on improving working capital levels or will it come later?\n\n---\n\nAgain, we are growing sequentially -- I mean, I probably should answer we are not selling anything, not in my reign. There's nothing to say. We're here to develop business and I think when you look at NIVEA, with 7.5% and you -- particularly, don't look at the 7.5%, look at the last quarters where we see, I think, very, very nice development. Eucerin is double-digit again, also not in an easy market. The pharmacy market is, for a lot of reasons, also not an easy market today. And even La Prairie, when you saw the latest from the Lauders and the rest of the world, even this selective market is now coming down and we're still growing above the crowd. These 3 brands are pretty good in shape. La Prairie and Eucerin are also, at the moment, coming with, I think, big innovations, both of them. La Prairie has shown it already nicely, affordable, and I think it's big. It's big what we're bringing in La Prairie and let's see how the market reacts towards that. What do we do with the rest of the brands? We work on them, so we're not going to let them die. Probably, we cannot survive everyone. I mean, one of our brands which we -- when you go back to the presentation you, for the first time, see a new brand on there which we never showed before. It's our plaster business, which we also now put focus again. It's a wonderful business, actually, our heritage, if you look at 130 years ago, plaster was the course of business. And with Hansaplast, Curitas and Elastoplast, we have a lot of nice business and a very, very sizable business, close to EUR 300 million net sales and healthy margins. So we're starting to work on that, and we have a couple of other brands which we now have put special teams on it, our new blood into there. And I hope that some of them start showing traction over the years to come. In terms of the cash and the dividend, I'm always asked, why is it so and so on? I can only tell you, I love it. It stays in the company. I think that is the biggest trust we have from our majority shareholder that he believes in the business and the things we do. Eventually, it's clear that we have to use it, that's clear. But for the time being, we follow our path, and I always said we are not ruling out M&A. But other than other companies, I mean, we're not putting it on the big wall. M&A comes at a certain point when the time is ready, then we probably ought to something. But not now. We still have to focus and have to gain so much on organic and have to grow so much the potential of the thing. So we follow that route diligently. And as Harold said, I mean, you could be in areas like tesa, could be areas like plaster, can be anything. The good news is we have so much cash available and we love it. It's better than debt, and that will continue. And we're not going to be forced to put money outside the company. We are keeping it in the company for the right time.\n\n---\n\nYes. Regarding the working capital. We have put a target in 2005 saying we think reasonable -- 12% of sales is a reasonable KPI for working capital. In this year, we are expanding the business to emerging markets, means that we are building plants over there but still a long way to go to supply markets. So we have structural disadvantage. Together with the plants, we'll see better ratios over the next years, but it's not a target that's high on our agenda. Cash in the moment is not very expensive, so we are not taking too much focus on that. I'm rather satisfied with the 12%.\n\n---\n\nSo we go to Andreas, Commerzbank, please.\n\n---\n\nTwo questions from my side. I understand that at present, growth is top priority, top line growth. You say you want to decentralize the business. You want to reach certain market positions or size. So my question would be, what is the prerequisite that in the future you may say, now we focus on margins again? What's the prerequisite for that? Number one. And question number two, an easy one. In Q4, growth in Western Europe was pretty strong. Maybe you can shed some light on that. Was that market share gains? I think so. Was it also a better market? Maybe you can speak about the market environment in Western Europe in the fourth quarter?\n\n---\n\nI mean, let's start with either question. The second one, I mean, you can all read the numbers. The Western Europe market is more or less flat in all our categories. That's what Nielsen reported. And we believe there will be a slight improvement this year, slight. Again, I mean, for me, the most important is, are we gaining market shares? I think nearly everywhere in Europe, we have gained tremendous free market shares driven by innovations, driven by better executions, driven by a lot of things. So I think we're doing good and -- but there's still a lot to make better. So we're not 100% there, but we're getting better and better. I think it's also good to see that market-by-market, if you look a little bit into the European shares, you can really see the track we took for a set market and we took the next market, we took the next market, we took the next market. And it's very interesting to see, we call it regional market to regional market, we have 5, 6 regions in Europe, step-by-step, everyone gets more or less better and better. To the first question, I could be ironic on that question, maybe never answer in my reign. Maybe I'll just go on. Why? Because I cannot answer one important question and the question is you tell me the potential of my current franchise. Is it EUR 6 billion? Is it EUR 7 billion? Is it EUR 8 billion? Is it EUR 9 billion? Is it EUR 10 billion? I believe it's closer to EUR 10 billion than it is to EUR 5 billion. If that is the case and the best investment for any entrepreneur or owner is to invest behind its own business, because this is what we know, this is what we can do. And I think we have tracks in the recent history that we started to do or to be someone who we are not to be. That's why I'm also always cautious on M&A. It's easy to say M&A, but you pay for M&A a big price. And also, and I don't want to sound lecturing here, is if you run teams, let's say, a football team, there's hardly a team can play offense and can't play defense. And Ulrich was really right what he said, if you want my guys to focus on working capital, they'll focus on working capital. If you want them to focus on efficiency, they'll focus on efficiency. You pay -- for everything you do, you pay a price. Margin improvement is the easiest bit on my business, the easiest bit. We're 63% margin 1. If I need to improve by 1% or 2% in a year, I can do that, big deal. The point is more, what is right for the business. And I think that as long as we go forward, we go for growth, with a slight improvement step-by-step in the markets. That's how we see things. That's a strategy and a call. But you cannot have it all, you cannot on the one hand say, \"I want growth and I want margin.\" Hardly, when you also follow history, very difficult to play the teams on both. The more we get together, the more over time I think we win at last at both better and better. But at that time, at that moment, it's growth, growth, growth. And my guys feel like winners. I have wonderful people. They are winning in the market. They have a motivation, unbelievable. That's what I need at the moment in tough markets like Europe, or tough markets in emerging markets. Whether they make a percent more on cost or not, it's not a big deal at the moment, it's growth. And it always comes back from the potential. That's how we see things. That's the core. Now you can disagree or not agree to the core, but that's a core we are going for. And I said as I think since I'm here and also together with my team, Ulrich and Ralph Gusko, and also with the majority shareholder, we're going for the potential of the company, loud and clear. And that's not going to change as long as we have the potential. But it's a call, it's a choice.\n\n---\n\nI think Iain also had a question.\n\n---\n\nIt's Iain Simpson of Barclays. Firstly, a sort of general question, I guess, which is we've clearly seen a massive step-up in execution in sort of a fairly profound cultural change over the last few years. How far along the journey of sort of changing personnel and getting people to performing at the top of their game do you feel Beiersdorf is now? I mean, how much is there left in the tank. You said that the management in America were recently changed. Are there any sort of particular problem areas you hope to see improve over coming quarters or do you feel that it's now the right people and it's all about the execution? And then just secondly, looking at your guidance, clearly, macro visibility at the moment is a little bit uncertain. It's not particularly clear what's happening with some of the emerging markets. So do you feel that you sort of built some safety room in there and that you could perhaps do a little bit better than that if things calm down? And then just lastly, looking at FX, you're talking about how you're sort of changing for how you deal with that in Argentina and Venezuela. Are you able to give us any sort of impact of current rates, what sort of impact we should expect in 2014?\n\n---\n\nPerhaps giving some comments regarding this year. You're right, seeing there's certain uncertainty in the world. It's not only Ukraine. It's also partly Latin America. We discussed Argentina, Venezuela already. We -- also, we are coping with the devaluation in a number of countries, so second half of last year was already the case. So we were able to defend our situation. On the other hand, there are a number of challenges. Then you can see Stefan's knee is still not functioning. So it's limited what we can do in management, with traveling and making an impression in the countries and things like that. And I'm not getting too much about it. I think there is uncertainty. We used to be conservative with our outlook. I've said that like-for-like calculations are slightly different this year. That might affect 0.5%, 0.1% of growth for Latin America in the overall effect. And we'll give a new guidance over the year. What we think is that cosmetic market like-for-like might well grow this year, 3%. Now if we end up with 5%, it's not too bad. Of course, our ambition is higher.\n\n---\n\nI think in terms of people, I think the general statement is that I'm, over the last 2 years, amazed what our people are able to do. I'm very proud with the teams. We have made a lot of changes but predominantly, internal changes. So we have given great chances to move up the ladder, and that has proven, as you see from the results, astonishingly well. That we're already the fastest growing company in our field is an attribute to -- contribute to the teams. Beiersdorf, as a rule, is as any company -- again, it's a choice, we are very strong in some functions and we're building these. I think we are pretty good in marketing nowadays. Still can grow here and there. We are becoming better and better in R&D, which is very important. And then there are definitely some functions where we can do better. So that's the room for more excellence, which probably over the years, was never trained that well. And here and there, we are putting more forces and also new forces to the ground to be better there. So there's still a lot of potential to get better. If you look at Bayern Munich, all it took them 4 or 5 years to dominate Europe. So we're just in the second year. I mean, German Bundesliga, my friend. Well, we see, I hope nobody's from Spain here. Someone from Spain here? No. So I think that they dominate at the moment and that's what we want to do in growth also, that we are known for bringing the innovations to the market, keeping our brands and here and there, like in every football team, you have to make year-by-year -- but it's more slight changes and adapting to really put some positions better in place. But overall, I'm very happy with the people and overall, I think we have some great talent and people here, which has to be further grown. My biggest headache is more to your question on the resource question per se. See if when I build India or we build Mexico or we build China, my problem is more that I have too little resources, too few resources to fuel my growth ambitions. So there, we have to work on, that's why we also have, as you know, a new HR chief since some months. I think a great addition to the team. But we need more talents to fuel the growth. That's clear.\n\n---\n\nOkay. No more questions? Then I would say -- Harold has a final one. Final, final?\n\n---\n\nA, B and C. No knee-jerk reaction on people, but are you basically suggesting that you need more people from the outside and the inside to deliver the growth ambitions which you have, is that what you basically said?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think really, predominantly, it only can happen from the inside because this is also, I think, the bench we probably -- if you look at that, it's probably -- that's a funny thing that probably some insight, in Beiersdorf, we have a strong first bench now. The next bench hardly exists. And then below that, we have great talents again. So we missed one if you want, how do you say, [German] one generation, right? And that layer we have to fill. We have taken a lot of strings up. The question is -- the thing is more when you look at -- I give Southeast Asia. I mean, we are growing significantly in Vietnam. That demands full team, which we built. But that means that resources you have to pool. We have, by far, a market year in Myanmar, yet I have no people there. Still, it's a market, though underestimated, of EUR 50 million, EUR 60 million which is now waking up. And so and so and so and so and so. And our people need to be trained in our culture, which is the branding culture, which is the marketing culture, which is the commercial, but also the financial discipline culture, and that takes time. So that's what we have to work on. But I'm confident. I mean, we are now obviously this company with success -- and that's a nice thing with the success. The more successful you are, the more you attract great talent. And I think we are -- we are on the roof. Our younger ranks look pretty healthy and pretty good for what is coming up. And here and there, we have -- also have to take people from outside to fill the big gaps we have. So it's a mixture of everything at the moment. But that will be one of the most important questions, getting the deeper questions solved over the years to come, with growth we expect there.\n\n---\n\nAnd then 2 sort of small ones. On tesa, Ulrich, you said -- you discussed about the life cycle of products, that it's hard to guide. What are you trying to say is that the -- what tesa supplies have got quite short life cycles so, therefore, it's hard to predict in the near-term? Is that what you're trying to say?\n\n---\n\nYes, okay. This is in electronics, in the industry?\n\n---\n\nJust electronics, yes.\n\n---\n\nNot in general.\n\n---\n\nAnd how much is electronics, again, of tesa?\n\n---\n\nMight be 20%.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then finally on Western Europe, you said your panels in December and, of course, early this year look healthy and I think you mentioned the word growth, 10%. So should one interpret that your start to the year is healthy?\n\n---\n\nLike you always ask, much better than my knee. But you see me smiling. We started good. I'm very happy, very happy and especially happy because Jan, Feb last year, we also run against quite some big comps. So you could argue, are they keeping the growth rate? But from the numbers -- and I'm not telling you anything, from the numbers you've seen so far, it looks pretty good. So there is a lot of work ahead of us and we also have to see what eventually our friends from competition are going to do. So it's a year where -- also to your question, the year is a very interesting and also hard to predict year, right? If I look just at us, I think we have a great year. If I, however, listen to other parties, et cetera, et cetera, there are some gray clouds on the horizon. When it really affects us in this or that way, hard to predict. I've never run through this with these brands. I would argue so that our portfolio is pretty robust against these downturns. Why? Because would someone really stop buying NIVEA? Don't think so. Eucerin, which is more medical skin, if you're a loyal user, hardly still. And what we see with La Prairie, you don't bring any La Prairie user changing. And whether it's EUR 50 more or EUR 50 less, I don't think that makes a huge difference. So I see our portfolio and also the quest for good cosmetics, for healthy skin, for something I think it really is some of the best industry I ever worked in and pretty robust for things to come, whether that holds major storms, probably not. But it is one of the -- if you ask me, one of the industry end markets to be in at that time, really is.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Nice final question, and I think that now this concludes our Q&A session. Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\nGood.",
      "transcript_text4": "【回答: Jens Geissler (Executives)】\nOkay. So these were the strategy update and the review of our full year numbers. Well, it looks like the microphones are ready, so please go ahead if you have any questions. Yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eva Quiroga (Analysts)】\nA couple of questions, please. First of all, we've seen the margin development in Consumer. Can you talk a little bit, as well, about the trends in Western Europe and North America? On the subject of North America, you have said in the past, Mr. Heidenreich, that you wanted to fix the other problems first and then think about North America. Have you started thinking about North America yet? And can you maybe remind us how big Venezuela and Argentina are of your Latin American sales?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stefan Heidenreich (Executives)】\nLet's start with Western Europe. And as such, I mean, I think we are very, very pleased in Western Europe. It was next to the west to the emerging market where we saw growth early on, Western Europe is now quite nicely growing. When you all, I guess, get the Nielsen numbers from quarter 4 and the Nielsen numbers in January, and if I recall from the numbers, there's no one growing except 1 company, which is Beiersdorf, in our field. And we're not growing 1% or 2%, we're growing close to 10%. So we are very pleased in Europe. Things are turning around there. And margin-wise, it's always the same. Once you grow in this business, you also make nice margins. So the margin development in Europe is still strong despite all the factors of pricing, of trade, of what can we count on. But it's overall in a very good development. We always had margin, but we've also gone back to growth. I think North America is a similar one and, it's such that we are finding our way better to growth. Again, I will, because I'm not talking normally for numbers, when you look at the Nielsen numbers, which came out for Jan, Feb for North America, I mean, our competitions are heavily decreasing and the only one growing big time is Beiersdorf. Have we found a way in North America? No, not a big way. But we have found a very nice way, I think, that we can grow in the singles. And we also, for the first time, are making nice margins. We already made nice margins in 2013, and that trend will continue. So it's not the big solution, but I think we changed the strategy dramatically. I will not tell more, but it's a different strategy than the year before and that seems to work so far. We also changed management and all the rest of it, but North America, I think, is at least in its size of what it is on a good trend.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Schmidt (Executives)】\nYes, regarding Latin America, we have a very unstable situation in Venezuela at the moment and so also open how the government will decide how to handle foreign exchange and imports. So it's rather weak, to give a forecast there. Argentina, we are having just seen a 20% devaluation. We would see some further devaluation over the year. Still, we think this one is a healthy one because Argentina had been over-evaluated in the past. It made imports very expensive for the economy. So we think this one is a good one. In total, the 2 countries are standing for about 15% of our sales for Latin America.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stefan Heidenreich (Executives)】\nSo you could also argue, Eva, why we did this. I think, again, we are very conservative when it comes to our approach to the business and I think also there, our company's well ahead of other companies. We took everything ahead of Venezuela, which, as you know, was quite substantial in our books, but that's gone. And now we also took -- take ahead of the crowd, the Argentina bid. If it doesn't come, even better. If it comes, we are prepared. But I mean, we are very clear with these growth rates. We also have the luxury to take certain things now.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jens Geissler (Executives)】\nOkay. So we jump to Harold, please.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Harold Thompson (Analysts)】\nThree questions, please. First of all, on supply chain and R&D. I mean, so you've got a big plant opening in the summer in Mexico. You've expanded your R&D in China. EUR 30 million in India is quite a substantial number. I mean, how crucial to your just gross margin developments are all these investments going forward? Is it kind of catch-up to what it should have been or is it kind of forward thinking? Second question is on tesa. I mean, it's -- I don't know what words to use to describe its performance, excellent, good, brilliant, whatever. But if the tesa team came to you, Stefan, and said, \"Right, actually, we'd like to spend EUR 0.5 billion buying another business because we're quite good at managing adhesives,\" what would your response be, given your kind of wider group, longer-term ambitions? And the second -- and the third and final point is, products are the lifeblood of the business. We saw some -- some interesting launches in 2013. You keep telling us 2015 is the better year. So does nothing happen in '14? The only reason I say that is because clearly, there aren't any slides or names of new products or initiatives for us to see.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stefan Heidenreich (Executives)】\nI'll let Ulrich do the second. Let's start with the easier one. I'm not showing you anything, and I will not talk about it even to the moment it is on the market. We have -- I think when you look at our categories, the 6 key categories, I think we have shown, and market share has proved, our innovations have really hit the market big time. And there's so much leeway still in the innovation that we have, in the first half year, we have some innovations, but I would call them in the first half year, very important innovation in key fields of my categories where I said we need to get a little better. For example, we launched 2 important lines with -- already, I shouldn't say this, but we launched 2 important lines, 1 on sensitive skin for face and 1 on sensitive skin for men. And both of them very important lines with nice inside [indiscernible] concept, why is it so important? Because for NIVEA, that's the core of the business, sensitive skin. We deliberately put in some categories, the big hits, into the second half. Why? Because we simply have so much growth and leeway on the innovations from 2013 that we still have to focus on bringing In-Shower home, Cellular home and Stress Protect to the full extent. So other than that, you will not hear from me, but I have more luxury problems than I have problems of which innovations I see for this and that, so the pipeline is still full. The -- now I'll let you first go on tesa, and then I answer Harold's first question, because that was an interesting question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Schmidt (Executives)】\nSo I'll give you an answer to the EUR 500 million. So it's a good question, but it's not easy to answer. First of all, we think tesa had done a very solid way in the last 20 years after doing heavy restructuring in the '90s, sort of rebuilding one step up to the other, had done a number of pruning in the commodity business, now upgrading and upgrading. So in principle, I would agree that in the moment, it could not be a bad time to commit an investment like that. So in principle, yes. How do I see the tesa management? Tesa management is very cautious. So when they see EUR 500 million compared to the EUR 1 billion, so it's very sizable. So they might hesitate. But I would think, if they came, then they would have thought a lot about it and they would think they can do it and then I would also think they can do it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stefan Heidenreich (Executives)】\nTo the first question, why did I say a little bit ironic? This is such an important category. I think that is another cornerstone of our Blue Agenda, and it's much further than a couple of plans and developments. I completely believe that we should go more regional and even more decentralization. My competitive friends are all claiming centralization on the core of it, and I think that's good. We go the other way around. Why? Because there is no such thing as one skin care, just does not exist. If I want to successfully conquer India, I have to have a plant, I have to have an R&D there, I need to have my marketing, I need to have my sales, I need the full nine yards to compete fully. I cannot do that with a plant in Hamburg, I cannot do that with an R&D lab from Hamburg. Sounds relatively simple, yet we were, for years and years, in a very centralized mode. I go the other way around. The second part of your question is a question which I will answer like that. If you just take a plant, a lab and all the rest of it to it and compare that cost-wise to the product sourcing out of a European center, even if you take the goodies of Texas or globalize in it, you would not make a huge margin gain. You would not. Some markets are different, India, for example. But in general, probably not. But I'm not building these plants for products which I have in Europe. I'm building these plants -- for example, like in India, we're coming with fully new assortments which we have never done before, assortments which really not talking to the A class of consumers, which talking to the B and C class. You have to see that mostly what you see in the financial analyst conferences, you see the -- also what you see on the shelf are products for the A class. You're not talking to the B class and we are not talking to the C class. If we go to Brazil, we go China or India. Products for EUR 0.10, products for EUR 0.05, products for EUR 0.04 or EUR 0.06 or EUR 0.075 needs different skill set, need different insights, and that's what we're after. Now that's a long quest, of course, but that's the only way to win in these markets. I think that if NIVEA stays where it is, it will become a super-premium brand in a lot of markets. So we have to go down, like in Europe, we're not considered premium, whereas in most of the emerging markets or a lot, we are considered super premium, super expensive. So that's the way we're going, so I will drive that company much more regional, much more decentralized and, yes, that's very different to my friends. But that is where we see the chance and where we also see the chances in winning with the consumers. So it's a very important question, yes?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gael Colcombet (Analysts)】\nGael from MainFirst. Two questions for me, from my side. The first one, when you talk about decentralizing the super chain and the whole organization and understanding that from historical background, you tended to export a lot out of Western Europe to these countries. Can you give us an idea in terms, for instance, of your volume or your revenues, how much of that is actually sourced from Western Europe into the emerging markets? My second question would be on tesa. Is there any reason why there, they seem to be a bit cautious on the guidance on EBIT margin and slightly below what they achieved for 2013? And my last question, which is also related to the decentralization of the organization, there was a significant spike in terms of your CapEx in '13. What is your expectation for '14?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Schmidt (Executives)】\nSo starting with the export volume from Western Europe to emerging markets. So out of emerging markets, cost of goods sold perhaps have 20% to 30% coming from Western Europe. That's based on -- oh, actually the assortment is especially coming from special products, face care products. We used to have plants in Latin America, in Mexico, Brazil and in Chile for the deodorant product, personal care products and basic skincare products. We have today already plants in China, in Thailand for the local products. But as was mentioned already, the formulas are very similar to what we have in Western Europe. Regarding tesa, we have had special effects in tesa in the year 2012. We had the closedown of 1 company that used to produce labels. It was a low-margin business in Switzerland. We closed it down, had an extraordinary loss of EUR 12 million. Last year, we had to close down a plant in Singapore also, a pvc low-margin business. But because of the valuable land, we had an extraordinary profit of EUR 18 million. So if you look to the profit of tesa, there's a swing of EUR 30 million, if you compare 2012 to '13. Now when we normalize the tesa profitability, profitability is rather 16% that we have had last year operationally and that would we expected also this year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stefan Heidenreich (Executives)】\nOn the last question, if the decentralization gains traction and we're playing with a lot of formats to make that successful because there's not 1 format. Mexico is a huge plant, a monster, which will not only serve Latin America, it will also serve North America. So that's a big one, probably one of the biggest we ever built outside -- definitely, the biggest we ever built outside of Europe. India, as I said, is a very different plant. It's basically there for really making the EUR 0.05 or EUR 0.10 products and has a huge expansion space if it is successful. It's a very different technology I'm looking for. And in China, we're also building. Now if these models prove, then depending on what the market needs -- and I have a lot of ideas where I need people, where I need teams, then we will further roll out, which inevitably then means more CapEx, more spending and, probably more important, investments. And that always becomes a question of growth and margin, it hasn't been asked but maybe I'd do that in front of everyone, I go on growth. Our #1 currency is market shares. As long as we gain market shares as we do today, we will further put that off. Margins will come. You see the margins, margin 1, it's a 63% margin, don't worry. But as long as I see that innovation in markets, which I can hit home -- and don't forget in the emerging markets, we are still relatively small in some markets, we will invest. If the teams prove that and it's successful, we will do that. So that's -- and that will still go on for years. So it's not like it will change next year or so on. We have a very clear understanding of where we want to go and we see still a lot of potential on NIVEA, Eucerin and also La Prairie. So we will hit home.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jens Geissler (Executives)】\nSo we go to Celine, please.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Celine Pannuti (Analysts)】\nThree questions. The first one is on zone AAA, can we maybe go a bit deeper in terms of the performance on Japan, China and Thailand. I understand Japan has been very strong. If you can mention what's the outlook there and how you see that continuing? Equally for China, there seem to have been a step-up in performance now for a few years in an environment that -- where we see lower growth in the Tier 1, Tier 2 cities, how we should be looking at China? And then I asked about Thailand because I think you have quite a sizable business there, given what's happening in that market. My second question is, just to remind you, at some point you mentioned that you see an opportunity for margin in Western Europe, but there is some pressure from the retail end as well as price pressure. If you can elaborate a bit more on that. And then lastly, to some of the, I mean, the question some of which you have alluded just now, but would it be fair, balancing margin and top line to that, we see the margin potential still coming from Western Europe but probably if I look at zone AAA, where you still should put your margin benefit from China becoming breakeven this year, beyond that, your focus will be probably reinvestment and, therefore, should we see Europe, North America as the margin driver and maybe emerging market being flat margin, if that makes sense?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Schmidt (Executives)】\nYes. So let's start with Japan. We have had very successful launches and brand support over the last years. We have strong gain in market share in Japan, comes together with the development of the market. You know that the government had been very pushy and had very inflationary supply of money, so that was helping the market in Japan. Finally, we launched shower products in Japan. All 3 factors together generated, clearly, double-digit growth in Japan. The same was true for China, that we had double-digit growth in the NIVEA business, as well as hair care business. We have reported already about launches of last year, while we have been successful and was meeting our expectation. Thailand was also doing good double-digit growth. So overall, Asia is in good shape. We had -- regarding the price situation in Europe, yes, there is a concentration of trade. On the other hand, that's not a recent development. That used to be the case in the last 10, 20 years. There is no trade company that's dominating or is very strongly growing. You have normally local heroes that dominate their local market and they try to play power games. We're used to that, on the other hand, we have a very strong market share and very strong brand. And I think that's a precondition for resisting. So we have had not big changes last year compared to what we had. What was helping was innovation. If you have good innovation, normally, you don't have too much fight with the trade. The question regarding the margin development in Asia, Africa and China overall, and in total, you've seen that we have double-digit EBIT ratios. Meanwhile, in all of that area, China still has negative result last -- this year, 2014, we are forecasted to be breakeven. We would then develop over the next years, together with the market share, also in China. We think that, especially in those markets where we have a very healthy market share, we also have a fair chance to grow profitability closer to Europe, while we want to keep our profitability that we have in Europe actually.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stefan Heidenreich (Executives)】\nAnd we had a nice slide there, I think it's Page 18, where you can see that we're growing our EBIT disproportionately in emerging markets. That actually illustrates the progress we are making right now.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jens Geissler (Executives)】\nSo another question from Pinar.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Pinar Ergun (Analysts)】\nThis is Pinar from Merrill Lynch. So my first question is, your top 3 brands: NIVEA, Eucerin and La Prairie, they're all growing organically above 7.5%, which means some of your other brands are dragging the overall growth down. So do you think these other brands can catch up with the rest of the group? Or if they don't, would you consider divesting them? And then my second question is regarding your cash policy. So on one hand, I see a conservative cash policy. You didn't raise your dividends. On the other hand, your working capital levels have deteriorated as a percentage of sales. So I guess the question is twofold. Why didn't your dividends grow when your earnings were growing and you had a good cash balance? And now what is your focus on -- whether you have a strong focus on improving working capital levels or will it come later?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stefan Heidenreich (Executives)】\nAgain, we are growing sequentially -- I mean, I probably should answer we are not selling anything, not in my reign. There's nothing to say. We're here to develop business and I think when you look at NIVEA, with 7.5% and you -- particularly, don't look at the 7.5%, look at the last quarters where we see, I think, very, very nice development. Eucerin is double-digit again, also not in an easy market. The pharmacy market is, for a lot of reasons, also not an easy market today. And even La Prairie, when you saw the latest from the Lauders and the rest of the world, even this selective market is now coming down and we're still growing above the crowd. These 3 brands are pretty good in shape. La Prairie and Eucerin are also, at the moment, coming with, I think, big innovations, both of them. La Prairie has shown it already nicely, affordable, and I think it's big. It's big what we're bringing in La Prairie and let's see how the market reacts towards that. What do we do with the rest of the brands? We work on them, so we're not going to let them die. Probably, we cannot survive everyone. I mean, one of our brands which we -- when you go back to the presentation you, for the first time, see a new brand on there which we never showed before. It's our plaster business, which we also now put focus again. It's a wonderful business, actually, our heritage, if you look at 130 years ago, plaster was the course of business. And with Hansaplast, Curitas and Elastoplast, we have a lot of nice business and a very, very sizable business, close to EUR 300 million net sales and healthy margins. So we're starting to work on that, and we have a couple of other brands which we now have put special teams on it, our new blood into there. And I hope that some of them start showing traction over the years to come. In terms of the cash and the dividend, I'm always asked, why is it so and so on? I can only tell you, I love it. It stays in the company. I think that is the biggest trust we have from our majority shareholder that he believes in the business and the things we do. Eventually, it's clear that we have to use it, that's clear. But for the time being, we follow our path, and I always said we are not ruling out M&A. But other than other companies, I mean, we're not putting it on the big wall. M&A comes at a certain point when the time is ready, then we probably ought to something. But not now. We still have to focus and have to gain so much on organic and have to grow so much the potential of the thing. So we follow that route diligently. And as Harold said, I mean, you could be in areas like tesa, could be areas like plaster, can be anything. The good news is we have so much cash available and we love it. It's better than debt, and that will continue. And we're not going to be forced to put money outside the company. We are keeping it in the company for the right time.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Schmidt (Executives)】\nYes. Regarding the working capital. We have put a target in 2005 saying we think reasonable -- 12% of sales is a reasonable KPI for working capital. In this year, we are expanding the business to emerging markets, means that we are building plants over there but still a long way to go to supply markets. So we have structural disadvantage. Together with the plants, we'll see better ratios over the next years, but it's not a target that's high on our agenda. Cash in the moment is not very expensive, so we are not taking too much focus on that. I'm rather satisfied with the 12%.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jens Geissler (Executives)】\nSo we go to Andreas, Commerzbank, please.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andreas Riemann (Analysts)】\nTwo questions from my side. I understand that at present, growth is top priority, top line growth. You say you want to decentralize the business. You want to reach certain market positions or size. So my question would be, what is the prerequisite that in the future you may say, now we focus on margins again? What's the prerequisite for that? Number one. And question number two, an easy one. In Q4, growth in Western Europe was pretty strong. Maybe you can shed some light on that. Was that market share gains? I think so. Was it also a better market? Maybe you can speak about the market environment in Western Europe in the fourth quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stefan Heidenreich (Executives)】\nI mean, let's start with either question. The second one, I mean, you can all read the numbers. The Western Europe market is more or less flat in all our categories. That's what Nielsen reported. And we believe there will be a slight improvement this year, slight. Again, I mean, for me, the most important is, are we gaining market shares? I think nearly everywhere in Europe, we have gained tremendous free market shares driven by innovations, driven by better executions, driven by a lot of things. So I think we're doing good and -- but there's still a lot to make better. So we're not 100% there, but we're getting better and better. I think it's also good to see that market-by-market, if you look a little bit into the European shares, you can really see the track we took for a set market and we took the next market, we took the next market, we took the next market. And it's very interesting to see, we call it regional market to regional market, we have 5, 6 regions in Europe, step-by-step, everyone gets more or less better and better. To the first question, I could be ironic on that question, maybe never answer in my reign. Maybe I'll just go on. Why? Because I cannot answer one important question and the question is you tell me the potential of my current franchise. Is it EUR 6 billion? Is it EUR 7 billion? Is it EUR 8 billion? Is it EUR 9 billion? Is it EUR 10 billion? I believe it's closer to EUR 10 billion than it is to EUR 5 billion. If that is the case and the best investment for any entrepreneur or owner is to invest behind its own business, because this is what we know, this is what we can do. And I think we have tracks in the recent history that we started to do or to be someone who we are not to be. That's why I'm also always cautious on M&A. It's easy to say M&A, but you pay for M&A a big price. And also, and I don't want to sound lecturing here, is if you run teams, let's say, a football team, there's hardly a team can play offense and can't play defense. And Ulrich was really right what he said, if you want my guys to focus on working capital, they'll focus on working capital. If you want them to focus on efficiency, they'll focus on efficiency. You pay -- for everything you do, you pay a price. Margin improvement is the easiest bit on my business, the easiest bit. We're 63% margin 1. If I need to improve by 1% or 2% in a year, I can do that, big deal. The point is more, what is right for the business. And I think that as long as we go forward, we go for growth, with a slight improvement step-by-step in the markets. That's how we see things. That's a strategy and a call. But you cannot have it all, you cannot on the one hand say, \"I want growth and I want margin.\" Hardly, when you also follow history, very difficult to play the teams on both. The more we get together, the more over time I think we win at last at both better and better. But at that time, at that moment, it's growth, growth, growth. And my guys feel like winners. I have wonderful people. They are winning in the market. They have a motivation, unbelievable. That's what I need at the moment in tough markets like Europe, or tough markets in emerging markets. Whether they make a percent more on cost or not, it's not a big deal at the moment, it's growth. And it always comes back from the potential. That's how we see things. That's the core. Now you can disagree or not agree to the core, but that's a core we are going for. And I said as I think since I'm here and also together with my team, Ulrich and Ralph Gusko, and also with the majority shareholder, we're going for the potential of the company, loud and clear. And that's not going to change as long as we have the potential. But it's a call, it's a choice.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jens Geissler (Executives)】\nI think Iain also had a question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Iain Simpson (Analysts)】\nIt's Iain Simpson of Barclays. Firstly, a sort of general question, I guess, which is we've clearly seen a massive step-up in execution in sort of a fairly profound cultural change over the last few years. How far along the journey of sort of changing personnel and getting people to performing at the top of their game do you feel Beiersdorf is now? I mean, how much is there left in the tank. You said that the management in America were recently changed. Are there any sort of particular problem areas you hope to see improve over coming quarters or do you feel that it's now the right people and it's all about the execution? And then just secondly, looking at your guidance, clearly, macro visibility at the moment is a little bit uncertain. It's not particularly clear what's happening with some of the emerging markets. So do you feel that you sort of built some safety room in there and that you could perhaps do a little bit better than that if things calm down? And then just lastly, looking at FX, you're talking about how you're sort of changing for how you deal with that in Argentina and Venezuela. Are you able to give us any sort of impact of current rates, what sort of impact we should expect in 2014?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Schmidt (Executives)】\nPerhaps giving some comments regarding this year. You're right, seeing there's certain uncertainty in the world. It's not only Ukraine. It's also partly Latin America. We discussed Argentina, Venezuela already. We -- also, we are coping with the devaluation in a number of countries, so second half of last year was already the case. So we were able to defend our situation. On the other hand, there are a number of challenges. Then you can see Stefan's knee is still not functioning. So it's limited what we can do in management, with traveling and making an impression in the countries and things like that. And I'm not getting too much about it. I think there is uncertainty. We used to be conservative with our outlook. I've said that like-for-like calculations are slightly different this year. That might affect 0.5%, 0.1% of growth for Latin America in the overall effect. And we'll give a new guidance over the year. What we think is that cosmetic market like-for-like might well grow this year, 3%. Now if we end up with 5%, it's not too bad. Of course, our ambition is higher.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stefan Heidenreich (Executives)】\nI think in terms of people, I think the general statement is that I'm, over the last 2 years, amazed what our people are able to do. I'm very proud with the teams. We have made a lot of changes but predominantly, internal changes. So we have given great chances to move up the ladder, and that has proven, as you see from the results, astonishingly well. That we're already the fastest growing company in our field is an attribute to -- contribute to the teams. Beiersdorf, as a rule, is as any company -- again, it's a choice, we are very strong in some functions and we're building these. I think we are pretty good in marketing nowadays. Still can grow here and there. We are becoming better and better in R&D, which is very important. And then there are definitely some functions where we can do better. So that's the room for more excellence, which probably over the years, was never trained that well. And here and there, we are putting more forces and also new forces to the ground to be better there. So there's still a lot of potential to get better. If you look at Bayern Munich, all it took them 4 or 5 years to dominate Europe. So we're just in the second year. I mean, German Bundesliga, my friend. Well, we see, I hope nobody's from Spain here. Someone from Spain here? No. So I think that they dominate at the moment and that's what we want to do in growth also, that we are known for bringing the innovations to the market, keeping our brands and here and there, like in every football team, you have to make year-by-year -- but it's more slight changes and adapting to really put some positions better in place. But overall, I'm very happy with the people and overall, I think we have some great talent and people here, which has to be further grown. My biggest headache is more to your question on the resource question per se. See if when I build India or we build Mexico or we build China, my problem is more that I have too little resources, too few resources to fuel my growth ambitions. So there, we have to work on, that's why we also have, as you know, a new HR chief since some months. I think a great addition to the team. But we need more talents to fuel the growth. That's clear.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jens Geissler (Executives)】\nOkay. No more questions? Then I would say -- Harold has a final one. Final, final?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Harold Thompson (Analysts)】\nA, B and C. No knee-jerk reaction on people, but are you basically suggesting that you need more people from the outside and the inside to deliver the growth ambitions which you have, is that what you basically said?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stefan Heidenreich (Executives)】\nWell, I think really, predominantly, it only can happen from the inside because this is also, I think, the bench we probably -- if you look at that, it's probably -- that's a funny thing that probably some insight, in Beiersdorf, we have a strong first bench now. The next bench hardly exists. And then below that, we have great talents again. So we missed one if you want, how do you say, [German] one generation, right? And that layer we have to fill. We have taken a lot of strings up. The question is -- the thing is more when you look at -- I give Southeast Asia. I mean, we are growing significantly in Vietnam. That demands full team, which we built. But that means that resources you have to pool. We have, by far, a market year in Myanmar, yet I have no people there. Still, it's a market, though underestimated, of EUR 50 million, EUR 60 million which is now waking up. And so and so and so and so and so. And our people need to be trained in our culture, which is the branding culture, which is the marketing culture, which is the commercial, but also the financial discipline culture, and that takes time. So that's what we have to work on. But I'm confident. I mean, we are now obviously this company with success -- and that's a nice thing with the success. The more successful you are, the more you attract great talent. And I think we are -- we are on the roof. Our younger ranks look pretty healthy and pretty good for what is coming up. And here and there, we have -- also have to take people from outside to fill the big gaps we have. So it's a mixture of everything at the moment. But that will be one of the most important questions, getting the deeper questions solved over the years to come, with growth we expect there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Harold Thompson (Analysts)】\nAnd then 2 sort of small ones. On tesa, Ulrich, you said -- you discussed about the life cycle of products, that it's hard to guide. What are you trying to say is that the -- what tesa supplies have got quite short life cycles so, therefore, it's hard to predict in the near-term? Is that what you're trying to say?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Schmidt (Executives)】\nYes, okay. This is in electronics, in the industry?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Harold Thompson (Analysts)】\nJust electronics, yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Schmidt (Executives)】\nNot in general.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Harold Thompson (Analysts)】\nAnd how much is electronics, again, of tesa?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Schmidt (Executives)】\nMight be 20%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Harold Thompson (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then finally on Western Europe, you said your panels in December and, of course, early this year look healthy and I think you mentioned the word growth, 10%. So should one interpret that your start to the year is healthy?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stefan Heidenreich (Executives)】\nLike you always ask, much better than my knee. But you see me smiling. We started good. I'm very happy, very happy and especially happy because Jan, Feb last year, we also run against quite some big comps. So you could argue, are they keeping the growth rate? But from the numbers -- and I'm not telling you anything, from the numbers you've seen so far, it looks pretty good. So there is a lot of work ahead of us and we also have to see what eventually our friends from competition are going to do. So it's a year where -- also to your question, the year is a very interesting and also hard to predict year, right? If I look just at us, I think we have a great year. If I, however, listen to other parties, et cetera, et cetera, there are some gray clouds on the horizon. When it really affects us in this or that way, hard to predict. I've never run through this with these brands. I would argue so that our portfolio is pretty robust against these downturns. Why? Because would someone really stop buying NIVEA? Don't think so. Eucerin, which is more medical skin, if you're a loyal user, hardly still. And what we see with La Prairie, you don't bring any La Prairie user changing. And whether it's EUR 50 more or EUR 50 less, I don't think that makes a huge difference. So I see our portfolio and also the quest for good cosmetics, for healthy skin, for something I think it really is some of the best industry I ever worked in and pretty robust for things to come, whether that holds major storms, probably not. But it is one of the -- if you ask me, one of the industry end markets to be in at that time, really is.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jens Geissler (Executives)】\nOkay. Nice final question, and I think that now this concludes our Q&A session. Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stefan Heidenreich (Executives)】\nGood.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you. Welcome to this telephone conference on the occasion of H&M's first quarter results 2014. I have our CFO, Jyrki Tervonen, here with me, and we'll be happy to answer questions after the presentation. You'll find the presentation slides to this telephone conference on hm.com. \r\nPlease look at the slide, First Quarter 2014. H&M group sales were good in the first quarter and we kept on taking market share. Sales, including VAT, amounted to SEK 37.5 billion, an increase of 13% in a market still affected by challenging macroeconomic conditions in many countries. In local currencies, the increase was 12%. Gross profit increased 13% to SEK 17.6 billion, corresponding to a gross margin of 54.9% compared to 55.2% a year ago. Markdowns in relation to sales increased marginally compared to Q1 2013. \r\nThe overall market situation for external factors, such as cotton prices, the U.S. dollar and cost inflation, was more or less neutral for sourcing to Q1 compared to last year. Looking at the sourcing period through the second quarter 2014, the market situation for the external factors remained more or less neutral to slightly negative. Cost inflation increased towards the end of the sourcing period. \r\nCost control in the H&M group remains very good. In the first quarter costs in comparable stores decreased slightly compared to the same quarter last year, both in absolute terms and as a share of sales. \r\nSG&A increased by 13% to SEK 14.2 billion in the first quarter. The increase is entirely related to our expansion and substantial long-term investments in IT and online as well as the broadening of the product range and the establishment of the new fashion brand, & Other Stories. \r\nAmong other things, the increased investments made it possible to open H&M's online store in France already on the 13th of March. Our long-term investments are very important as they are aimed at further strengthening our market position and securing future expansion. These long-term investments will continue, and in 2014, costs will be at a higher level than in 2013. During 2014, these costs may be divided unequally between the quarters. As Q1 is H&M's smallest quarter, the cost increase has a higher percentage impact on profits in Q1 than in the other quarters of the year. \r\nOperating profit increased by 9% to SEK 3.4 billion. Excluding the long-term investments, the profit increase would have been 14%. Operating margin was 10.6% compared to 11%. \r\nProfit after financial items increased by 8% to SEK 3.5 billion. After a tax rate of 24%, net profit increased to SEK 2.6 billion, equaling earnings per share of SEK 1.60, up from SEK 1.49. \r\nAnd now for some other key figures, please turn to the slide, Key Data. Stock-in-trade as of the 28th of February amounted to SEK 15.9 billion, an increase of 15% in SEK and 14% in local currencies. The increase is mainly explained by the expansion in stores and online. The level and composition of the stock-in-trade are considered good. \r\nCash flow from current operations was SEK 2.7 billion compared to SEK 3.8 billion a year ago. The main explanation is higher tax payments in the quarter. \r\nInvestments in terms of CapEx totaled SEK 1.6 billion. And for the full year, we expect CapEx of between SEK 9 billion and SEK 9.5 billion at today's exchange rates. \r\nThe financial position of the group remained strong. Liquid funds amounted to SEK 18.2 billion. And return on equity was 37.2% rolling 12 months compared to 36.3%. \r\nAnd now, some words on H&M's expansion. Please turn to the slide, Expansion. The global expansion of the H&M Group continues. In the first quarter, we opened a net of 60 new stores. And at the end of the quarter, the total number of stores was 3,192 in 53 countries, all brands included. For 2014, we plan to open around 375 stores -- new stores net within our expansion target of increasing the number of stores by 10% to 15% per year. China and the U.S. are again expected to be the largest expansion markets. Later today, for example, the first -- the very first H&M store in Hawaii will open. It's a flagship store in the best location in Waikiki, Honolulu. We see room for continued expansion in other existing markets and in new markets. In 2014, we will open more H&M flagship stores than last year. Planned locations include, for example, East Nanjing Road in Shanghai and Weinstrasse in Munich. In New York, where we opened a spectacular H&M store in Times Square recently, 2 more flagship stores are planned to open this year on Fifth Avenue and Herald Square. \r\nNext week, on the 5th of April, Australia will become a new market for H&M with the opening of a flagship store in Melbourne. It will be a 3-level store in the historical General Post Office building, which is a real landmark in Melbourne. \r\nIn the second half of the year, the Philippines and India will also become new H&M markets with openings planned in Manila and Delhi. \r\nNext year, expansion will continue in the Southern Hemisphere. We will open the first H&M store in Lima in Peru and the first store in South Africa. \r\nExpansion continues also for the newer brands of the group like COS, & Other Stories, Monki, Weekday and Cheap Monday, as well as H&M Home. COS has over 90 stores in more than 20 markets and a very good performance. Last year, COS opened around 20 new stores and at least as many are planned for this year. New markets for COS this year will be Australia, the U.S. with stores both in New York and Los Angeles, and South Korea, as well as Switzerland, which opened in February. \r\n& Other Stories develops very well with 8 stores to date and at least the same number will be added in 2014. & Other Stories will also open in new markets: the U.S., Belgium and the Netherlands. Both COS and Stories will launch online sales in the U.S. in 2014, and Austria and Ireland will become new online markets for Stories. \r\nWe also extended our sports range, H&M Sport. Please turn to the next slide. We have a strong offering, and we are constantly working to further develop and broaden our product range. One example is the updated H&M Sport range, which has been very well received by customers. The new H&M Sport is available in selected stores in 18 markets and online. Continued rollout to more stores and countries is planned, as well as further broadening of the sports range. \r\nOur brands reach more and more customers, and we are expanding H&M's online presence to more markets globally. Please turn to the slide, H&M Online. Following the successful start of H&M's online store in the U.S. last year, we launched Shop Online in France this March. Initial reception by our customers has been very good, and the global rollout continues. Next in line will be Spain and Italy, early autumn, and we also plan to open H&M online in China at the end of 2014. \r\nAnd now, before we start the Q&A session, just a few comments to summarize. If we look at current trading, sales increased 12% in local currencies from 1st to 25th March compared to the same period last year. And looking ahead, we still have respect for the macroeconomic situation that remains challenging in many markets. But we are optimistic about the future for the H&M group with many great collections, a strong market position and great potential for continued expansion. We keep investing long term to strengthen the position of the group even further. \r\nAnd with that, we are now happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions]",

      "transcript_text3": "I had -- I was wondering, on the comparable store development for SG&A, which was down this year in absolute terms and I believe it was down last year again so it's been very, very controlled there. How do you look at that going forwards assuming positive like-for-like growth on the sales line? How should we look at that development?\n\n---\n\nThat's correct, they were slightly down in comparable stores in Q1 and also I think last year as well. In the long term, of course, it's hard to always come down in comparable stores. Of course, we are working to trying to find efficiencies in the store operations, but of course, in the long run with the underlying cost inflation, et cetera, so we of course need positive like-for-like development.\n\n---\n\nAnd are there any particular initiatives you're taking there to have that impressive development at the moment?\n\n---\n\nThere are a lot of initiatives in the stores. And of course, as we have said previously, we are looking to better tools for planning our sales and staffing the hours in a more correct way that we don't make, so to say, easy mistakes trying to find the calendar effect, et cetera. So we are working and trying to find new tools to help the stores to plan better. And also in different areas for electricity consumption, we are looking in how to be more efficient in the consumption because the prices are increasing in many countries. So there are, of course, a lot of different initiatives that we are constantly working on in our daily operations.\n\n---\n\nSo question on the OpEx impact, please. I mean, it obviously looks like it was around SEK 170 million in Q1 in terms of the impact from the long-term growth investments. I mean, I just wondered whether we should expect the full year impact to be around 4x that? Or will the impact reduce in the coming quarters in terms of an absolute amount, as well as a percentage of sales.\n\n---\n\nYes, as we said, in connection with Q4, the long-term investments during 2014 will be on a higher level than 2013 and our best estimate for the full year is that it will be in the range of SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million on a yearly level. But always to remember that can differ from quarter-to-quarter and also the impact, of course, is higher in a small quarter like Q1 compared maybe to Q2 or Q4. But that's our best estimate. And as you know, all bigger projects, there are so many dependencies so it can vary, but best estimate on a yearly level is SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And just one more, please. On the China online launch, why is that taking place after the launches in Spain and Italy? What additional steps need to be taken to start online in the China market?\n\n---\n\nFor every online launch, there's a lot of adaptions to each country. And obviously, since we now have France up and running and some other countries within EU, it's much easier to launch in Spain and Italy, which are in the EU. China is, of course, very different in very many aspects and therefore more complex.\n\n---\n\nThis is Vick Mohan in for Omar. So wondering if you could you talk a bit about the competitive landscape globally and if you see new competition affecting your business in any region.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think, in general, fashion apparel is perhaps one of the most competitive industries in the world to start with, and I think competition is always, by default, getting stronger and stronger because everyone wants to improve. But at the same time, of course, there are new competitors coming aboard and developing well and there are others who have problems so -- and it varies, of course, from market to market. So that's the reason why -- I mean, since there is -- it's so tough competition, we can never relax and sit still. It's always about improving things. Constant improvement is one of the most important values in H&M.\n\n---\n\nAnd secondly, do you see, kind of the promotionality that affected your gross margins a bit, do you see that continuing this year or subsiding and leveling off a bit?\n\n---\n\nIt's very difficult to say because it varies from market to market, but I mean, we are present today in more than -- in 53 countries, and of course, we have to adjust to the prevailing marketing conditions everywhere. And if you start with the U.S., I mean, it has been extremely intensive last year with promotions and markdown activities and of course we have to respond to that.\n\n---\n\nAgainst the SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million longer-term investment expected for this year, would you expect a similar sort of envelope for next year? Or should that level of investment start to fade as of 2015?\n\n---\n\nWhat we can say about 2015, the long-term investments will still be on a high level, but exactly the amount, that we have to come back to in connection maybe in the full year report. But these investments, they are not only here and now, they will continue and also going more and more to omni-channel. We have to also update our technology in the stores, et cetera, et cetera. So our estimate is that they will remain on a high level in 2015 as well. But we have to remember that a lot of those initiatives that we have taken or taking now, they will also start to generate revenues and some of them already have, but not maybe in full scale. So of course, in the long term, these investments are aimed to generate revenues and bottom line. So we see them as very important.\n\n---\n\nAll right. And secondly, could you just develop slightly your commentary vis-à-vis a pickup in sourcing cost inflation as of the end of second quarter. What sort of areas are you seeing? Where are you seeing that inflation coming through?\n\n---\n\nWell, actually, we think this is positive because it's something we've been actively pushing for, especially in countries like Bangladesh and Cambodia, for sustainability reasons and we see that increased salaries there leads to better stability and more sustainable situation, of course, so that's actually very positive.\n\n---\n\nAnd I also think -- yes, sorry. And I also think this is becoming more and more important for our customers. I think if you don't do these important investments, I think that will be a mistake. I think everybody of us, me and most probably all of us, are going into that direction, understand the necessity of thinking sustainable in all areas in life. So I think that's also very, very important aspect to have in mind.\n\n---\n\nI see. So the inflation is coming through from the wage inflation, right?\n\n---\n\nPrimarily, yes.\n\n---\n\nYes. And I'm sorry, just to confirm then because the dollar is at sort of $1.38 or whatever to the euro right now, so you're not seeing that as a benefit to offset some of this wage inflation or...\n\n---\n\nIt's definitely in the short term a positive, absolutely. But the total picture of all these external factors are becoming more negative. But that is not the same as saying that the margins will go down because that's a totally different thing as we've said many, many times before. It's of course up to us how we handle it and how we work with them and of course how we position ourselves and work with the customer offering.\n\n---\n\nMy question's actually about some of the new and more geographically distant markets that you're entering this year and in the coming years. Can you talk a little bit about how you're handling distribution for those markets and logistics? Are you starting to build distribution centers for them now? Are you fulfilling from other locations? And how are you thinking about that in the long term?\n\n---\n\nWell, one of the views about continuing to grow with the same pace every year is that you gradually build up a logistic infrastructure. So for us, it's not a big thing. Of course, it's a lot of work to set up a new country, but we have now a lot of good experience, good people and good processes in order to scale this up to country-to-country -- next country to next country and we have already a setup, as you know, in the Southern Hemisphere and we are scaling this up. So it's nothing dramatic.\n\n---\n\nMy question on the investments there, the SEK 170 million for this quarter and the continuation in the rest of the year, does this include investing in your click-and-collect capability? And can you remind us where you offer click-and-collect? If I remember well you do not offer that yet in the U.S. Any plans there?\n\n---\n\nIt's interesting that you mentioned. One, I mean there are a lot of different things included in these long-term investments where it's primarily IT and online, but it's also, just to remind you, the & Other Stories and H&M Sport, et cetera. And of course, we are investing in platform-related IT questions but also in expansion to set up organization and staff, et cetera. And of course in improving the features like click-and-collect could be one of them. But it's not just that, of course not.\n\n---\n\nBut do you plan to offer click and collect in the U.S. anytime soon?\n\n---\n\nI mean, as I said, at any given point of time, there are lots of different features that we want to improve and click-and-collect is one of them, but I can't tell you when or if it's going to be.\n\n---\n\nOkay. All right. One more question, please, if I may then. In terms of -- a little bit more short term-ish this one, I'm afraid. In terms of your March sales, the one that you've reported there, should we be aware of any calendar effects? And how do you see calendar effects progress into next month because of the difference in Easter from year-to-year in March and April. Maybe you could help us understand how this could deviate.\n\n---\n\nSure. Again, Easter is very difficult to quantify. But it's true that now, this week, right now, we are meeting last year's Easter week. And so I would say that it is a slight negative effect this year. I mean, the calendar impact is slightly negative. But it's important always to look at March, April and I would say May, together, because you have these -- every year, you have shifts of these holidays like Easter and other holidays and also when -- the spring weather is very volatile as well. So when you look at our monthly figures some years back, they are very volatile. And just to remind you, it seems like last year it was a weak month, but it was upon a very strong 2012. I think we increased 24%, 26% or something. So yes, to summarize, you should look at the 3 months together.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So that means that then even April that looks extremely -- that looks relatively strong last year, if we see it on a 2-month or even 3-month basis, then potentially it was not as weak last year so potentially we could expect a bit of spillover into April from March. Is that what you're implying?\n\n---\n\nI didn't quite follow you there.\n\n---\n\nNo. I mean, in terms of because you said that March last year wasn't as weak as it looked, should we then assume that also April year last wasn't as strong as it looked?\n\n---\n\nWell, yes, of course, it goes in both ways. And if I said -- I also said that the Easter week we are facing now is a slight negative and will be reversed, so a slight positive in April, of course.\n\n---\n\nThe first question I have is on these long-term project costs -- the SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million. Can I just be clear that, that is incremental growth in long-term cost spend, the SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million versus last year? So in aggregate, what is that level of spend, first question.\n\n---\n\nWe prefer not to aggregate the total long-term investment there. We think that we are making a huge investments, but we prefer not to exactly quantify the aggregate amount of investment. But we wanted to give you a better guidance of what we're talking about for 2014 compared to 2013 and then our best estimate is that the increase will be around SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million during this year compared to last year.\n\n---\n\nThat is very helpful. And the second question on cost is, were the -- was the FX impact on your operating costs very similar to the impact on sales? You used to give [ph]...\n\n---\n\nYes, they increased 12% in local currencies.\n\n---\n\nFantastic. And then on inventory. You described the composition and level of inventory as good. I think that's the first quarter in about 6 or 7 that you've been able to use that adjective. Does that mean that there's a chance that we could start to see markdown recover from here? I mean, you have just a multi-year soft comp at the markdown level.\n\n---\n\nIt's far too early. We are beginning of the season, so it's far. But of course, if we continue to have a strong development in the top line and then of course our aim is also to be more efficient than better when it comes to markdowns. But yes, let's see. It's far too early. It's still 2 strong months ahead of us and we don't know how the turnover development will be.\n\n---\n\nUnderstood. And sorry, one final cheeky question. The contribution from net new space and net new online stores to revenue, was that similar in Q1 to Q4? Suppose a marketing factor [ph]. What was the like-for-like? You used to disclose it.\n\n---\n\nThe like-for-like in the quarter was positive, but we don't quantify the exact number.\n\n---\n\nJust one simple question for me. In terms of the gross margin, is there a difference between different geographies on the gross margins? So is there a -- as your geographic mix changes, is there any sort of geographic mix shift, either upwards or downwards in the gross margin that we should be thinking about?\n\n---\n\nOf course, there are slight differences between the different countries but no major, and starting from the customer offering, our price spread between different countries is actually, I would say, very small and smaller compared to most peers. So no, there isn't any simple pattern for geographical reasons depending on our expansion, no.\n\n---\n\nAnd if you were to overlay the markdown that you've seen over the last couple of years on top of that pretty standard gross margin, does that make a large difference in gross margin by territory post markdown?\n\n---\n\nCould you repeat again, please? I'm trying to understand what you're aiming at.\n\n---\n\nOnce you -- is your level of markdown primarily in a certain number of countries?\n\n---\n\nOkay, I got you. It's of course depending from country to country, but it varies over time due to competition and how much we have bought, et cetera. So again, there is no simple pattern in that and it's not focused on a certain -- a few countries. It's spread pretty evenly across the group.\n\n---\n\nJust one more on these long-term investments, if that's okay. I'm just wondering when we're thinking about the costs of going in here, particularly with those related to the launch of online, are these costs that you very much consider to be one-off that once an online store has launched and if we look a few years forward once all of your global online stores have launched, these costs drop out? Or are any way these costs related to kind of just the ongoing running costs of having an online offer?\n\n---\n\nSome of the costs are, of course, one-off, but a lot of those costs will still be taken when we open up Spain and Italy and China. And also when looking at the different cost structure, comparing normal retailing compared to online, of course, the cost structure is quite different. It's so much more IT-intense when opening up an online store. So they will, of course, still be generating costs but also generating top line and bottom line in the future. But it's important to maybe stress that it's not only technical solutions that is driving costs. One should maybe think that this is one huge, big store where we need people for merchandising the goods, we need a logistic chain. So there are, of course, a lot of different, different additional costs that is connected to launching a new online market. So I don't know if that was a clear answer to your question, but some of them, of course, are one-offs but there are still investments and costs to come.\n\n---\n\nOkay. No, that's very useful. In terms of if we do think about this, therefore, as one big store as you say, over what kind of period of time does it take to get kind of leverage out of that big store? How do you expect that to flow through as these online businesses kind of gather pace in those key markets?\n\n---\n\nIt's very difficult to tell you, but, I mean, the reason why we invest so much in this is, of course, that we see it's very, very interesting and it's going very fast now. So we see that the multichannel strategy is very interesting. To have the store network in combination with online and a strong brand is very, very important than exactly when the payoff is not that interesting. And of course, it depends a bit from market to market but it's not that we say, okay, now we invest for France, now we invest for Italy, blah, blah, blah. We invest a lot for the group and then, of course, we can capitalize on this for each of the new countries that we're launching with the necessary adjustments that we may need to do. And also just to finalize, this is not ending with China. Of course, the plan -- this is a global rollout so next year, of course, this will be followed by more countries to come.\n\n---\n\nSorry to disappoint you, I'm going to ask about the long-term costs again.\n\n---\n\nI'm surprised.\n\n---\n\nI genuinely think -- I must be quite stupid because I don't understand, frankly, what the difference between something that is a regular cost or a long-term cost is. When does something go from being a long-term cost to being in your regular P&L in terms of operating cost? I'm using the word cost because I always thought investments went on the balance sheet and costs went through the P&L, so...\n\n---\n\nYes, it's simply that, of course, long term is that some parts, as we have said, will be capitalized in the balance sheet and some are more, you can say, start-up cost. Of course, a lot of these costs will be in the running cost when we are starting to fully generate revenues but open up -- opening up, for instance, a big flagship store, then we have also quite high start-up costs compared to a more normal store. So of course, there is no exactly clear cut when it starts to come operating. But let's say, after a full year's running in a normal store, then of course, it's purely running costs. But the first year, it's a lot of start-up costs involved in that P&L for that store. Was that clear?\n\n---\n\nHe'll come back again if he wants.\n\n---\n\nJust curious how the online launch in France went, given it's your first country with -- on a new, more standardized platform?\n\n---\n\nYes, very good, thank you. And the customers are happy and so are we.\n\n---\n\nJust a point of clarification. Have you actually -- I may have missed it earlier on the call. Have you actually said what the actual markdown impact was in basis points at all?\n\n---\n\nNo. I think, we only just said marginal, but I mean if you want to -- it's around 10 bps maybe, so it's more or less nothing.\n\n---\n\nI'm very sorry for anyone else on the line. I completely missed the answer, apologies.\n\n---\n\nOkay, I was just trying to say that some of these long-term investments, of course, a part of these are going to be capitalized in the balance sheet. But some can be looked more as a start-up cost. I tried to compare to opening of a store, a flagship store. Of course, the first year, there are a huge amount of start-up costs. And maybe the second year running, then it's more normal operations and therefore the profit and loss for a new opened store, the P&L for that store for that year is, of course, hit a lot of start-up costs and that's the same opening up a new online market. Because before you get the scale, the volume and et cetera, you have to have the platform, the organization, you have to have the people, but you don't get the full scale revenue and profitability in the beginning. So of course, when it's up and running, of course, then it's going to more normal operation, then it's not a long-term investment. And also when looking at, for instance, our new formats, for instance, & Other Stories, of course, we have been opening 8 stores last year, planning to open at least 8 this year as well. But before we have the volume, before we have the full economies of scale, the bottom line is, of course, not on that level that we want to have it in the long run. So you can also classify that, that it's a long-term investment before we are up in that volume and the economies of scale when it's really going to benefit and give a bottom line that we are expecting in the long run. So in a way, the stores are in normal operation, but you are not there in full scale where you want to be. So in a way, that, of course, you can classify that as well, that's a long-term investment.\n\n---\n\nRight. But you wouldn't do that for an H&M store, for example, would you, although presumably most of those do not drag on margin when you first open them.\n\n---\n\nExactly, exactly. You're correctly right. It's totally different to open up one additional H&M store compared to open up a new format.\n\n---\n\nBut a new H&M country might drag on your margin, though. Would that go in long-term investments?\n\n---\n\nYes, exactly. That could be, but we don't. We don't call that for H&M. There, we have a much better foundation in the group to take care of a new country. In smaller formats, we don't have maybe that broad, broad base. But for opening up a new H&M country, of course, it will have a lot of start-up costs, for sure.\n\n---\n\nRight. So I apologize hogging the phone here. So with your investments being SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million incremental in the current year, that, on my calculations, is about 0.5 percentage point drag to your operating margin as a business and that will be sort of in addition to whatever else you might achieve as a business. Now do you think, as you keep referring to long-term investments continuing, that this will keep therefore dragging down your operating margin for some years to come as you launch additional countries or it won't? Because I think we all get a little confused between absolute percent to sales here when you talk about it.\n\n---\n\nYes, for this year, if you have been calculating. But we have to see next year on what level we will have these long-term investments increase compared to 2014. But yes, as you said, you can see it as this will be affecting the EBIT if it's landing SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million, that, of course, will give that affect.\n\n---\n\nAndreas Lundberg with ABG Stockholm. Can I ask you about the Q1 leverage here? Are you surprised that you didn't get even more or positive leverage in the quarter on operations given a positive like-for-like and also that the currencies still on the positive year-on-year? And that you also get some costs down on a comparable perspective.\n\n---\n\nNo, not really. I mean, there was a slight positive like-for-like, absolutely, but there's not much leverage on that because you always have inflation increases, et cetera. But I mean, we did get as I said, costs in comparable stores were flattish or down actually and sales were up. So the increase is all about the expansion in stores and online and these long-term investments. That's exactly why we decided to quantify them to show that on the running business, we have 100% control and it's doing very well.\n\n---\n\nAnd to add in, they are according to our plan. So we have planned for this increase in the cost OpEx, so it's no surprise for us.\n\n---\n\nCould I ask you on your sourcing costs because they were structurally much higher today given your increased focus on sustainability?\n\n---\n\nI would say, yes, of course, we invest a lot in sustainability but it also pays off. So it's a win-win, I would say.\n\n---\n\nJust on online, does the scale of the investments that you've had to make in new markets and capability, fundamentally alter your medium-term view about the profitability of online, which I think you've said in the past, approaches that of stores?\n\n---\n\nNo, it doesn't.\n\n---\n\nIt's back on the old topic, on the SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million. Just looking to understand how you calculated that number, so if I was to use the new store analogy, one could calculate that cost from considering just the start-up costs or you could consider the start-up costs and the net trading performance of that new store. How did you come to that SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's according -- when we are looking at the investments we have done, and remember, this is not only the online and IT investment, there are also a lot of other connected costs that we are taking forward for development, our existing assortment, et cetera. But we have purely looked into our budgets and plans, what we are planning to do during the year and how that will affect our cost increase in those specific areas that we are classifying as long-term investments and that is some of the IT projects that we are classifying long-term investments online, online expansion to new countries to build up the new platform and also looking into broadening our existing offer. Those is purely that we are looking how much we need in staffing up the organization, how much adaptions we have to do in existing technology and assistance, et cetera, and then we adapt in this amount. It's simple as that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So there's no kind of net trading performance within there. So if opening up online is initially loss-making, for example, then the kind of net loss wouldn't be included in that figure?\n\n---\n\nNo, no.\n\n---\n\nCould I ask you on online versus physical store rollouts. Given your longer-term guidance and hopes to grow by 10% to 15% per annum, in the case that the online channel actually even in your business plan achieves basically the same penetration as in several of the markets that you operate in, would you still open up the same amount of physical stores to fulfill the long-term guidance range?\n\n---\n\nWe still see huge potential to open up physical stores despite the fact that online and e-commerce is growing. So I mean, 10% to 15% is a number we feel that we can grow, we can keep for many years. And as long as we can do that, with continued high profitability and quality, we will continue. But of course, somewhere in the future, I'm sure that we need to slow down, or I mean, online, et cetera, will change the picture. But as of today, no -- no changes.\n\n---\n\nWould you care to leverage on where that threshold lies? Do you think you -- let's say that you derive 5% of your total group revenue from online sales or 10%, would that, do you think, change the rollout of actual physical stores?\n\n---\n\nI don't think it's that simple. There are so many other things in the total equation. And I mean, just to remind you, we've had online sales in Sweden for many, many years and we still add new stores because there is a need for it in some places still. \r\nAny more questions, please? If not, I would say I would like to thank you all very much for participating in this conference call, and we'll come back for the 6 months' results on the 18th of June.\n\n---\n\nAre there any more questions?\n\n---\n\nNo. I just said since there were no questions, again, I repeat, thank you very much for participating, and we'll come back for the 6 months' results in the 18th of June. Goodbye.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Erik Karlsson (Analysts)】\nI had -- I was wondering, on the comparable store development for SG&A, which was down this year in absolute terms and I believe it was down last year again so it's been very, very controlled there. How do you look at that going forwards assuming positive like-for-like growth on the sales line? How should we look at that development?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nThat's correct, they were slightly down in comparable stores in Q1 and also I think last year as well. In the long term, of course, it's hard to always come down in comparable stores. Of course, we are working to trying to find efficiencies in the store operations, but of course, in the long run with the underlying cost inflation, et cetera, so we of course need positive like-for-like development.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Erik Karlsson (Analysts)】\nAnd are there any particular initiatives you're taking there to have that impressive development at the moment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nThere are a lot of initiatives in the stores. And of course, as we have said previously, we are looking to better tools for planning our sales and staffing the hours in a more correct way that we don't make, so to say, easy mistakes trying to find the calendar effect, et cetera. So we are working and trying to find new tools to help the stores to plan better. And also in different areas for electricity consumption, we are looking in how to be more efficient in the consumption because the prices are increasing in many countries. So there are, of course, a lot of different initiatives that we are constantly working on in our daily operations.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Chamberlain (Analysts)】\nSo question on the OpEx impact, please. I mean, it obviously looks like it was around SEK 170 million in Q1 in terms of the impact from the long-term growth investments. I mean, I just wondered whether we should expect the full year impact to be around 4x that? Or will the impact reduce in the coming quarters in terms of an absolute amount, as well as a percentage of sales.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, as we said, in connection with Q4, the long-term investments during 2014 will be on a higher level than 2013 and our best estimate for the full year is that it will be in the range of SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million on a yearly level. But always to remember that can differ from quarter-to-quarter and also the impact, of course, is higher in a small quarter like Q1 compared maybe to Q2 or Q4. But that's our best estimate. And as you know, all bigger projects, there are so many dependencies so it can vary, but best estimate on a yearly level is SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Chamberlain (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And just one more, please. On the China online launch, why is that taking place after the launches in Spain and Italy? What additional steps need to be taken to start online in the China market?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nFor every online launch, there's a lot of adaptions to each country. And obviously, since we now have France up and running and some other countries within EU, it's much easier to launch in Spain and Italy, which are in the EU. China is, of course, very different in very many aspects and therefore more complex.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vickram Mohan (Analysts)】\nThis is Vick Mohan in for Omar. So wondering if you could you talk a bit about the competitive landscape globally and if you see new competition affecting your business in any region.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nYes, I think, in general, fashion apparel is perhaps one of the most competitive industries in the world to start with, and I think competition is always, by default, getting stronger and stronger because everyone wants to improve. But at the same time, of course, there are new competitors coming aboard and developing well and there are others who have problems so -- and it varies, of course, from market to market. So that's the reason why -- I mean, since there is -- it's so tough competition, we can never relax and sit still. It's always about improving things. Constant improvement is one of the most important values in H&M.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vickram Mohan (Analysts)】\nAnd secondly, do you see, kind of the promotionality that affected your gross margins a bit, do you see that continuing this year or subsiding and leveling off a bit?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nIt's very difficult to say because it varies from market to market, but I mean, we are present today in more than -- in 53 countries, and of course, we have to adjust to the prevailing marketing conditions everywhere. And if you start with the U.S., I mean, it has been extremely intensive last year with promotions and markdown activities and of course we have to respond to that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nAgainst the SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million longer-term investment expected for this year, would you expect a similar sort of envelope for next year? Or should that level of investment start to fade as of 2015?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nWhat we can say about 2015, the long-term investments will still be on a high level, but exactly the amount, that we have to come back to in connection maybe in the full year report. But these investments, they are not only here and now, they will continue and also going more and more to omni-channel. We have to also update our technology in the stores, et cetera, et cetera. So our estimate is that they will remain on a high level in 2015 as well. But we have to remember that a lot of those initiatives that we have taken or taking now, they will also start to generate revenues and some of them already have, but not maybe in full scale. So of course, in the long term, these investments are aimed to generate revenues and bottom line. So we see them as very important.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nAll right. And secondly, could you just develop slightly your commentary vis-à-vis a pickup in sourcing cost inflation as of the end of second quarter. What sort of areas are you seeing? Where are you seeing that inflation coming through?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWell, actually, we think this is positive because it's something we've been actively pushing for, especially in countries like Bangladesh and Cambodia, for sustainability reasons and we see that increased salaries there leads to better stability and more sustainable situation, of course, so that's actually very positive.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nAnd I also think -- yes, sorry. And I also think this is becoming more and more important for our customers. I think if you don't do these important investments, I think that will be a mistake. I think everybody of us, me and most probably all of us, are going into that direction, understand the necessity of thinking sustainable in all areas in life. So I think that's also very, very important aspect to have in mind.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nI see. So the inflation is coming through from the wage inflation, right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nPrimarily, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nYes. And I'm sorry, just to confirm then because the dollar is at sort of $1.38 or whatever to the euro right now, so you're not seeing that as a benefit to offset some of this wage inflation or...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nIt's definitely in the short term a positive, absolutely. But the total picture of all these external factors are becoming more negative. But that is not the same as saying that the margins will go down because that's a totally different thing as we've said many, many times before. It's of course up to us how we handle it and how we work with them and of course how we position ourselves and work with the customer offering.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jamie Merriman (Analysts)】\nMy question's actually about some of the new and more geographically distant markets that you're entering this year and in the coming years. Can you talk a little bit about how you're handling distribution for those markets and logistics? Are you starting to build distribution centers for them now? Are you fulfilling from other locations? And how are you thinking about that in the long term?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWell, one of the views about continuing to grow with the same pace every year is that you gradually build up a logistic infrastructure. So for us, it's not a big thing. Of course, it's a lot of work to set up a new country, but we have now a lot of good experience, good people and good processes in order to scale this up to country-to-country -- next country to next country and we have already a setup, as you know, in the Southern Hemisphere and we are scaling this up. So it's nothing dramatic.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nMy question on the investments there, the SEK 170 million for this quarter and the continuation in the rest of the year, does this include investing in your click-and-collect capability? And can you remind us where you offer click-and-collect? If I remember well you do not offer that yet in the U.S. Any plans there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nIt's interesting that you mentioned. One, I mean there are a lot of different things included in these long-term investments where it's primarily IT and online, but it's also, just to remind you, the & Other Stories and H&M Sport, et cetera. And of course, we are investing in platform-related IT questions but also in expansion to set up organization and staff, et cetera. And of course in improving the features like click-and-collect could be one of them. But it's not just that, of course not.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nBut do you plan to offer click and collect in the U.S. anytime soon?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nI mean, as I said, at any given point of time, there are lots of different features that we want to improve and click-and-collect is one of them, but I can't tell you when or if it's going to be.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nOkay. All right. One more question, please, if I may then. In terms of -- a little bit more short term-ish this one, I'm afraid. In terms of your March sales, the one that you've reported there, should we be aware of any calendar effects? And how do you see calendar effects progress into next month because of the difference in Easter from year-to-year in March and April. Maybe you could help us understand how this could deviate.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nSure. Again, Easter is very difficult to quantify. But it's true that now, this week, right now, we are meeting last year's Easter week. And so I would say that it is a slight negative effect this year. I mean, the calendar impact is slightly negative. But it's important always to look at March, April and I would say May, together, because you have these -- every year, you have shifts of these holidays like Easter and other holidays and also when -- the spring weather is very volatile as well. So when you look at our monthly figures some years back, they are very volatile. And just to remind you, it seems like last year it was a weak month, but it was upon a very strong 2012. I think we increased 24%, 26% or something. So yes, to summarize, you should look at the 3 months together.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nOkay. So that means that then even April that looks extremely -- that looks relatively strong last year, if we see it on a 2-month or even 3-month basis, then potentially it was not as weak last year so potentially we could expect a bit of spillover into April from March. Is that what you're implying?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nI didn't quite follow you there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nNo. I mean, in terms of because you said that March last year wasn't as weak as it looked, should we then assume that also April year last wasn't as strong as it looked?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWell, yes, of course, it goes in both ways. And if I said -- I also said that the Easter week we are facing now is a slight negative and will be reversed, so a slight positive in April, of course.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nThe first question I have is on these long-term project costs -- the SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million. Can I just be clear that, that is incremental growth in long-term cost spend, the SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million versus last year? So in aggregate, what is that level of spend, first question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nWe prefer not to aggregate the total long-term investment there. We think that we are making a huge investments, but we prefer not to exactly quantify the aggregate amount of investment. But we wanted to give you a better guidance of what we're talking about for 2014 compared to 2013 and then our best estimate is that the increase will be around SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million during this year compared to last year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nThat is very helpful. And the second question on cost is, were the -- was the FX impact on your operating costs very similar to the impact on sales? You used to give [ph]...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, they increased 12% in local currencies.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nFantastic. And then on inventory. You described the composition and level of inventory as good. I think that's the first quarter in about 6 or 7 that you've been able to use that adjective. Does that mean that there's a chance that we could start to see markdown recover from here? I mean, you have just a multi-year soft comp at the markdown level.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nIt's far too early. We are beginning of the season, so it's far. But of course, if we continue to have a strong development in the top line and then of course our aim is also to be more efficient than better when it comes to markdowns. But yes, let's see. It's far too early. It's still 2 strong months ahead of us and we don't know how the turnover development will be.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nUnderstood. And sorry, one final cheeky question. The contribution from net new space and net new online stores to revenue, was that similar in Q1 to Q4? Suppose a marketing factor [ph]. What was the like-for-like? You used to disclose it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nThe like-for-like in the quarter was positive, but we don't quantify the exact number.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Adam Cochrane (Analysts)】\nJust one simple question for me. In terms of the gross margin, is there a difference between different geographies on the gross margins? So is there a -- as your geographic mix changes, is there any sort of geographic mix shift, either upwards or downwards in the gross margin that we should be thinking about?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nOf course, there are slight differences between the different countries but no major, and starting from the customer offering, our price spread between different countries is actually, I would say, very small and smaller compared to most peers. So no, there isn't any simple pattern for geographical reasons depending on our expansion, no.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Adam Cochrane (Analysts)】\nAnd if you were to overlay the markdown that you've seen over the last couple of years on top of that pretty standard gross margin, does that make a large difference in gross margin by territory post markdown?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nCould you repeat again, please? I'm trying to understand what you're aiming at.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Adam Cochrane (Analysts)】\nOnce you -- is your level of markdown primarily in a certain number of countries?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nOkay, I got you. It's of course depending from country to country, but it varies over time due to competition and how much we have bought, et cetera. So again, there is no simple pattern in that and it's not focused on a certain -- a few countries. It's spread pretty evenly across the group.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Bowler (Analysts)】\nJust one more on these long-term investments, if that's okay. I'm just wondering when we're thinking about the costs of going in here, particularly with those related to the launch of online, are these costs that you very much consider to be one-off that once an online store has launched and if we look a few years forward once all of your global online stores have launched, these costs drop out? Or are any way these costs related to kind of just the ongoing running costs of having an online offer?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nSome of the costs are, of course, one-off, but a lot of those costs will still be taken when we open up Spain and Italy and China. And also when looking at the different cost structure, comparing normal retailing compared to online, of course, the cost structure is quite different. It's so much more IT-intense when opening up an online store. So they will, of course, still be generating costs but also generating top line and bottom line in the future. But it's important to maybe stress that it's not only technical solutions that is driving costs. One should maybe think that this is one huge, big store where we need people for merchandising the goods, we need a logistic chain. So there are, of course, a lot of different, different additional costs that is connected to launching a new online market. So I don't know if that was a clear answer to your question, but some of them, of course, are one-offs but there are still investments and costs to come.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Bowler (Analysts)】\nOkay. No, that's very useful. In terms of if we do think about this, therefore, as one big store as you say, over what kind of period of time does it take to get kind of leverage out of that big store? How do you expect that to flow through as these online businesses kind of gather pace in those key markets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nIt's very difficult to tell you, but, I mean, the reason why we invest so much in this is, of course, that we see it's very, very interesting and it's going very fast now. So we see that the multichannel strategy is very interesting. To have the store network in combination with online and a strong brand is very, very important than exactly when the payoff is not that interesting. And of course, it depends a bit from market to market but it's not that we say, okay, now we invest for France, now we invest for Italy, blah, blah, blah. We invest a lot for the group and then, of course, we can capitalize on this for each of the new countries that we're launching with the necessary adjustments that we may need to do. And also just to finalize, this is not ending with China. Of course, the plan -- this is a global rollout so next year, of course, this will be followed by more countries to come.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nSorry to disappoint you, I'm going to ask about the long-term costs again.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nI'm surprised.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nI genuinely think -- I must be quite stupid because I don't understand, frankly, what the difference between something that is a regular cost or a long-term cost is. When does something go from being a long-term cost to being in your regular P&L in terms of operating cost? I'm using the word cost because I always thought investments went on the balance sheet and costs went through the P&L, so...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, it's simply that, of course, long term is that some parts, as we have said, will be capitalized in the balance sheet and some are more, you can say, start-up cost. Of course, a lot of these costs will be in the running cost when we are starting to fully generate revenues but open up -- opening up, for instance, a big flagship store, then we have also quite high start-up costs compared to a more normal store. So of course, there is no exactly clear cut when it starts to come operating. But let's say, after a full year's running in a normal store, then of course, it's purely running costs. But the first year, it's a lot of start-up costs involved in that P&L for that store. Was that clear?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nHe'll come back again if he wants.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Erik Karlsson (Analysts)】\nJust curious how the online launch in France went, given it's your first country with -- on a new, more standardized platform?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nYes, very good, thank you. And the customers are happy and so are we.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Rossington (Analysts)】\nJust a point of clarification. Have you actually -- I may have missed it earlier on the call. Have you actually said what the actual markdown impact was in basis points at all?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nNo. I think, we only just said marginal, but I mean if you want to -- it's around 10 bps maybe, so it's more or less nothing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nI'm very sorry for anyone else on the line. I completely missed the answer, apologies.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nOkay, I was just trying to say that some of these long-term investments, of course, a part of these are going to be capitalized in the balance sheet. But some can be looked more as a start-up cost. I tried to compare to opening of a store, a flagship store. Of course, the first year, there are a huge amount of start-up costs. And maybe the second year running, then it's more normal operations and therefore the profit and loss for a new opened store, the P&L for that store for that year is, of course, hit a lot of start-up costs and that's the same opening up a new online market. Because before you get the scale, the volume and et cetera, you have to have the platform, the organization, you have to have the people, but you don't get the full scale revenue and profitability in the beginning. So of course, when it's up and running, of course, then it's going to more normal operation, then it's not a long-term investment. And also when looking at, for instance, our new formats, for instance, & Other Stories, of course, we have been opening 8 stores last year, planning to open at least 8 this year as well. But before we have the volume, before we have the full economies of scale, the bottom line is, of course, not on that level that we want to have it in the long run. So you can also classify that, that it's a long-term investment before we are up in that volume and the economies of scale when it's really going to benefit and give a bottom line that we are expecting in the long run. So in a way, the stores are in normal operation, but you are not there in full scale where you want to be. So in a way, that, of course, you can classify that as well, that's a long-term investment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nRight. But you wouldn't do that for an H&M store, for example, would you, although presumably most of those do not drag on margin when you first open them.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nExactly, exactly. You're correctly right. It's totally different to open up one additional H&M store compared to open up a new format.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nBut a new H&M country might drag on your margin, though. Would that go in long-term investments?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, exactly. That could be, but we don't. We don't call that for H&M. There, we have a much better foundation in the group to take care of a new country. In smaller formats, we don't have maybe that broad, broad base. But for opening up a new H&M country, of course, it will have a lot of start-up costs, for sure.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nRight. So I apologize hogging the phone here. So with your investments being SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million incremental in the current year, that, on my calculations, is about 0.5 percentage point drag to your operating margin as a business and that will be sort of in addition to whatever else you might achieve as a business. Now do you think, as you keep referring to long-term investments continuing, that this will keep therefore dragging down your operating margin for some years to come as you launch additional countries or it won't? Because I think we all get a little confused between absolute percent to sales here when you talk about it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, for this year, if you have been calculating. But we have to see next year on what level we will have these long-term investments increase compared to 2014. But yes, as you said, you can see it as this will be affecting the EBIT if it's landing SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million, that, of course, will give that affect.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andreas Lundberg (Analysts)】\nAndreas Lundberg with ABG Stockholm. Can I ask you about the Q1 leverage here? Are you surprised that you didn't get even more or positive leverage in the quarter on operations given a positive like-for-like and also that the currencies still on the positive year-on-year? And that you also get some costs down on a comparable perspective.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nNo, not really. I mean, there was a slight positive like-for-like, absolutely, but there's not much leverage on that because you always have inflation increases, et cetera. But I mean, we did get as I said, costs in comparable stores were flattish or down actually and sales were up. So the increase is all about the expansion in stores and online and these long-term investments. That's exactly why we decided to quantify them to show that on the running business, we have 100% control and it's doing very well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nAnd to add in, they are according to our plan. So we have planned for this increase in the cost OpEx, so it's no surprise for us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andreas Lundberg (Analysts)】\nCould I ask you on your sourcing costs because they were structurally much higher today given your increased focus on sustainability?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nI would say, yes, of course, we invest a lot in sustainability but it also pays off. So it's a win-win, I would say.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Geoff Lowery (Analysts)】\nJust on online, does the scale of the investments that you've had to make in new markets and capability, fundamentally alter your medium-term view about the profitability of online, which I think you've said in the past, approaches that of stores?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nNo, it doesn't.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Bowler (Analysts)】\nIt's back on the old topic, on the SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million. Just looking to understand how you calculated that number, so if I was to use the new store analogy, one could calculate that cost from considering just the start-up costs or you could consider the start-up costs and the net trading performance of that new store. How did you come to that SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, it's according -- when we are looking at the investments we have done, and remember, this is not only the online and IT investment, there are also a lot of other connected costs that we are taking forward for development, our existing assortment, et cetera. But we have purely looked into our budgets and plans, what we are planning to do during the year and how that will affect our cost increase in those specific areas that we are classifying as long-term investments and that is some of the IT projects that we are classifying long-term investments online, online expansion to new countries to build up the new platform and also looking into broadening our existing offer. Those is purely that we are looking how much we need in staffing up the organization, how much adaptions we have to do in existing technology and assistance, et cetera, and then we adapt in this amount. It's simple as that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Bowler (Analysts)】\nOkay. So there's no kind of net trading performance within there. So if opening up online is initially loss-making, for example, then the kind of net loss wouldn't be included in that figure?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nNo, no.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nicklas Fhärm (Analysts)】\nCould I ask you on online versus physical store rollouts. Given your longer-term guidance and hopes to grow by 10% to 15% per annum, in the case that the online channel actually even in your business plan achieves basically the same penetration as in several of the markets that you operate in, would you still open up the same amount of physical stores to fulfill the long-term guidance range?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWe still see huge potential to open up physical stores despite the fact that online and e-commerce is growing. So I mean, 10% to 15% is a number we feel that we can grow, we can keep for many years. And as long as we can do that, with continued high profitability and quality, we will continue. But of course, somewhere in the future, I'm sure that we need to slow down, or I mean, online, et cetera, will change the picture. But as of today, no -- no changes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nicklas Fhärm (Analysts)】\nWould you care to leverage on where that threshold lies? Do you think you -- let's say that you derive 5% of your total group revenue from online sales or 10%, would that, do you think, change the rollout of actual physical stores?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nI don't think it's that simple. There are so many other things in the total equation. And I mean, just to remind you, we've had online sales in Sweden for many, many years and we still add new stores because there is a need for it in some places still. \r\nAny more questions, please? If not, I would say I would like to thank you all very much for participating in this conference call, and we'll come back for the 6 months' results on the 18th of June.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nAre there any more questions?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nNo. I just said since there were no questions, again, I repeat, thank you very much for participating, and we'll come back for the 6 months' results in the 18th of June. Goodbye.",

We have Hao Jian Min in the center, who is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; next to him, Mr. Xiao Xiao, Vice Chairman; and then, Mr. Chen, Yi Executive Director; to the far left, our Executive Director and CFO, Mr. Horace Nip; next to me, Mr. [indiscernible] Sung, Investors Relations Officer. \r\nMr. Hao will take us through the performance of 2013.\n\n---\n\nI'm delighted to be able to meet with you here. I would like to thank you for your long-term support for the company, and I would also want to say hello to those watching our webcast. \r\nToday, I'm going to focus on 4 areas in my presentation. I will try my best to shorten the time so that there will be more time left to make exchanges with you.  So I want to thank you again for your support. \r\nFirst of all, I would like to take us through the annual results for 2013. For 2013, we realized turnover of HKD 82.47 billion, year-on-year growth of 27.7%. Together with the turnover of our JV corporations, the total amount is HKD 100.47 billion, year-on-year growth of 29%. Profit attributable to shareholders, HKD 23.04 billion, growth of 23.1%. And the core net profit increased by 20% to HKD 18.96 billion. We have realized the annual net profit rate of 27.9%. Excluding security housing and the 3 repo projects, it is 35.1%. EPS totaled HKD 0.82, a growth of 23.1%. We proposed a final dividend per share of HKD 0.29. Total dividend for the year, HKD 0.47, an increase of 20.5%. \r\nThe next chart is about the growth of funds of our shareholders which increased by 26% to HKD 109.97 billion. And the net asset value per share, HKD 13.5; the return at 23.4%. \r\nBy the end of the year, we had cash HKD 41.48 billion; total long-term debt, HKD 69.4 billion. Net gearing ratio slightly increased to 28.4%. We continue to realize a rate that was lower than 40%, sustaining our financial viability. \r\nNext, we can see the segment results highlights. During the period, we realized turnover for the property development segment, HKD 78.62 billion, which was 95% of our total figure, a growth of 28%. For the rental income, it increased to HKD 857 million, an increase of 46.5%. For the development segment, we realized a profit of HKD 27.32 billion, an increase of 8.6%. Investment portion, HKD 4.2 billion, increase of 1.4%. \r\nAnd you can see some financing situation. From 2013, we obtained for the first time from Fitch, BBB+ investment rating. We were also readjusted to BBB+ and Baa1 by S&P and Moody's. So once again, our viability is very well recognized. \r\nIn October last year, we successfully issued security notes of maturity of 5, 10 and 30 years. Total amount USD 1.5 billion, and the interest rates were 3.375%, 5.375% and 6.375%, respectively. So it was another round of successful launch of long-term debt providing more assurance concerning our long-term development. \r\nThis is a chart showing financial resources and debt structure. Cash at hand, HKD 41.48 billion, 9.6% was Hong Kong dollars and 15.2% was U.S. dollars, and the remaining, renminbi. Together with HKD 8.76 billion undrawn bank facility, the total usable resources was HKD 50.24 billion. 95% of our debt is long-term, and you can see this further optimizes our debt structure. Corporate debt, HKD 32.69 billion; bank loans, HKD 40 billion. 42.3% is Hong Kong dollars, 45.7% in U.S. dollars, and 12% in renminbi.\r\nNext, we shall look at the business review of 2013. For the whole year, contracted sales achieved HKD 138.52 billion; GFA sold 9.234 million square meters. If you look at different districts, for the Mainland part, contracted sales was HKD 136.94 billion. For the outer delta region, HKD 43.99 billion, making the greatest contribution to the group. The corresponding figure for Hong Kong and Macau was HKD 1.58 billion. Receivables exceeded HKD 124.4 billion. \r\nFor the first 2 months of the year, you can see some figures. I have already disclosed this information. The realized contracted sales HKD 24.32 billion, and subscription of HKD 7.79 billion, about to be confirmed in the coming months. Next, you can see projects completed in 2013. The group completed 35 fresh projects and JV completed 10, total of 8.39 million square meters. And according to our calculation, we have already sold 84.4% and 72.6% of saleable GFA for the group and the JV, which is very satisfactory. \r\nNext, completed inventory. Total GFA 1.34 million square meters, which is at a very healthy level. Next chart, property and booked for 2013. Booked GFA, 7.32 million square meters. Total value, HKD 111.1 billion by the end of the year for our JV projects. 4.35 million square meters have been presold. For the next chart, our land acquisitions. In 2013, 24 lots have been added to our reserve, covering Beijing, Shanghai and Xi'an. Total GFA 12.11 million square meters. Equity premium, HKD 42.58 billion. \r\nThis is the situation for 2014. Beginning from the year until now, we have acquired 7 lots. GFA, 5.285 million square meters; equity premium, HKD 17.57 billion. This is the total landbank situation. In 2013, we have entered for the first time, [indiscernible] Harbin, Fuzhou and Wuxi. In 2014, we entered Zhengzhou. So we have entered 32 first and second tier cities, together with the 14 first tier cities covered by COGO, we have been covering 46 cities. \r\nNext chart, investment property situation. By the end of last year, we have total GFA of 2.6 million square meters and 2 million loaned to commercial properties, taking up 77%. Under operation, 600,000 square meters. Rental situation is very good, covering Hong Kong, Beijing and Chengdu offices and also the Unipark in Jinan. We're talking about over 90% of occupancy rate. And the rental rate has increased. The rental income has increased to HKD 857 million, a growth of 46.5%. \r\nThe next section is about the macro situation. In 2013, as you can see in the chart, these are some economic outlook for China, and I believe that you already have such information, so I won't go through them in great details. The growth came down to 7.7%, but the economic structure is actually more healthy. So the fundamentals are very stable. In the future, urbanization, industrialization will continue. There could be some uncertainties and difficulties, but we trust that the overall quality of our economy will continue to improve with stable growth. \r\nNext, you probably are very concerned about liquidity in the financial market. I trust that you have done a lot of analysis already and therefore, I will not go through the details. Basically, I just have a brief conclusion. We see very stable and healthy fundamentals for fiscal policy and the increase of m2 have slowed down to 13%. So there will be slowing down of loan balances, but it is more than sufficient to support the realization of the annual GDP growth of 7.5%. Taking on with the Golden 10 rules being issued, commercial banks will be more prudent in allocation of their credits. So overall development of the market will be very stable and well balanced. This chart is again about liquidity. As we all know, with the speeding up of the reform measures of the financial system in China, there will be more stringent supervision. So perhaps there will be some fluctuations in 2014. There would be some defaults leading to the possibility of accidental tightening. But there will be a return of the normal situation very quickly. \r\nConcerning overseas markets, many advanced countries have been improving in terms of their economic situation, and there is capital inflow again. The appreciation of renminbi and also the interest spread will not go through fundamental changes in the shorter term. \r\nNext, investment and financing management. You can see some measures we have implemented and also advantages enjoyed by the group. The centralized fund management, we have a dedicated committee responsible for the allocation of funds, so that we are actively responding to any possible risk and changes in the liquidity market. We have a dual platform which continues to be very effective, ensuring healthy flow of funds, and it is sufficient to support our future investment and development. \r\nThis chart, it is about dividends of urbanization and the contribution to GDP growth rate. I'm sure you have plenty of such information so I won't go into any details. \r\nWe are experiencing this great opportunity presented by urbanization. For a very long term, this is going to provide new economic growth point. There will continue to be investment need for infrastructure, public facilities and housing. Third tier cities will continue to benefit from the growth of population, and first and second tier cities will also continue to benefit in terms of industry upgrades and improving of environmental quality. So concentration of population will lead to improvement of living quality, especially it will be reflected in the added value to property sector of the first and second tier cities. \r\nNext, some statistics concerning the property market in the past decade and some outlook information. You will see very stable growth concerning the volume of sales and the price of property. Together with further economic development and urbanization measures, we believe that the 1 billion square meter level will be sustained per year in terms of supply of residential units. We believe that the increase of supply has to be supported by the increase of sales investment. In different places, there could be different structures, so in the future, first and second tier cities will continue to see more or less an equilibrium in the supply and demand structures. \r\nThis chart is about our value chain. Some previous practices. Again, I won't go into the details because I trust that you already know about our past, so I don't want to be very repetitive. \r\nThe final part, guidance and strategy. I trust that you're very concerned about this. So I will tell you some details now. You can see our target for 2014. We would like to sustain 20% growth of our net profit. In terms of completion, we will sustain a very stable progress so that we can control our cost within reasonable limits. 10 million square meters to be completed, plenty of projects. GFA will be 12 million. Contracted sales, we will continue to focus on our target of HKD 148 billion. \r\nI trust that you will ask about this, so I just wanted to provide you with the answer now. Saleable resources, HKD 220 billion. \r\nWe will not casually acquire land without careful considerations. Newly added land reserve, about 10 million square meters; CapEx, HKD 110 billion. HKD 50 billion will go into the newly acquired land. For different projects, HKD 46 billion. Another HKD 14 billion are to be payments for previously acquired land lots. \r\nThis is the final chart. You can see the breakdown for property to be completed because of some requests we have received. You wanted some further breakdowns according to different regions. Anyway, we're happy to disclose this. In Hua Nan, Hua Dong, Northern, Hua Bei, Western and Hong Kong and Macau, you can see the GFA completion targets.  Hopefully, this is more convenient for you to do your calculation analysis. \r\nSo basically, I have taken you through everything. We will now take questions from you. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\n[Chinese] Hong Kong investors to the 2013 annual results press conference -- annual results announcement for China Overseas Land & Investment Limited. We have Hao Jian Min in the center, who is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; next to him, Mr. Xiao Xiao, Vice Chairman; and then, Mr. Chen, Yi Executive Director; to the far left, our Executive Director and CFO, Mr. Horace Nip; next to me, Mr. [indiscernible] Sung, Investors Relations Officer. \r\nMr. Hao will take us through the performance of 2013.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Jian Min Hao (Executives)】\nI'm delighted to be able to meet with you here. I would like to thank you for your long-term support for the company, and I would also want to say hello to those watching our webcast. \r\nToday, I'm going to focus on 4 areas in my presentation. I will try my best to shorten the time so that there will be more time left to make exchanges with you.  So I want to thank you again for your support. \r\nFirst of all, I would like to take us through the annual results for 2013. For 2013, we realized turnover of HKD 82.47 billion, year-on-year growth of 27.7%. Together with the turnover of our JV corporations, the total amount is HKD 100.47 billion, year-on-year growth of 29%. Profit attributable to shareholders, HKD 23.04 billion, growth of 23.1%. And the core net profit increased by 20% to HKD 18.96 billion. We have realized the annual net profit rate of 27.9%. Excluding security housing and the 3 repo projects, it is 35.1%. EPS totaled HKD 0.82, a growth of 23.1%. We proposed a final dividend per share of HKD 0.29. Total dividend for the year, HKD 0.47, an increase of 20.5%. \r\nThe next chart is about the growth of funds of our shareholders which increased by 26% to HKD 109.97 billion. And the net asset value per share, HKD 13.5; the return at 23.4%. \r\nBy the end of the year, we had cash HKD 41.48 billion; total long-term debt, HKD 69.4 billion. Net gearing ratio slightly increased to 28.4%. We continue to realize a rate that was lower than 40%, sustaining our financial viability. \r\nNext, we can see the segment results highlights. During the period, we realized turnover for the property development segment, HKD 78.62 billion, which was 95% of our total figure, a growth of 28%. For the rental income, it increased to HKD 857 million, an increase of 46.5%. For the development segment, we realized a profit of HKD 27.32 billion, an increase of 8.6%. Investment portion, HKD 4.2 billion, increase of 1.4%. \r\nAnd you can see some financing situation. From 2013, we obtained for the first time from Fitch, BBB+ investment rating. We were also readjusted to BBB+ and Baa1 by S&P and Moody's. So once again, our viability is very well recognized. \r\nIn October last year, we successfully issued security notes of maturity of 5, 10 and 30 years. Total amount USD 1.5 billion, and the interest rates were 3.375%, 5.375% and 6.375%, respectively. So it was another round of successful launch of long-term debt providing more assurance concerning our long-term development. \r\nThis is a chart showing financial resources and debt structure. Cash at hand, HKD 41.48 billion, 9.6% was Hong Kong dollars and 15.2% was U.S. dollars, and the remaining, renminbi. Together with HKD 8.76 billion undrawn bank facility, the total usable resources was HKD 50.24 billion. 95% of our debt is long-term, and you can see this further optimizes our debt structure. Corporate debt, HKD 32.69 billion; bank loans, HKD 40 billion. 42.3% is Hong Kong dollars, 45.7% in U.S. dollars, and 12% in renminbi.\r\nNext, we shall look at the business review of 2013. For the whole year, contracted sales achieved HKD 138.52 billion; GFA sold 9.234 million square meters. If you look at different districts, for the Mainland part, contracted sales was HKD 136.94 billion. For the outer delta region, HKD 43.99 billion, making the greatest contribution to the group. The corresponding figure for Hong Kong and Macau was HKD 1.58 billion. Receivables exceeded HKD 124.4 billion. \r\nFor the first 2 months of the year, you can see some figures. I have already disclosed this information. The realized contracted sales HKD 24.32 billion, and subscription of HKD 7.79 billion, about to be confirmed in the coming months. Next, you can see projects completed in 2013. The group completed 35 fresh projects and JV completed 10, total of 8.39 million square meters. And according to our calculation, we have already sold 84.4% and 72.6% of saleable GFA for the group and the JV, which is very satisfactory. \r\nNext, completed inventory. Total GFA 1.34 million square meters, which is at a very healthy level. Next chart, property and booked for 2013. Booked GFA, 7.32 million square meters. Total value, HKD 111.1 billion by the end of the year for our JV projects. 4.35 million square meters have been presold. For the next chart, our land acquisitions. In 2013, 24 lots have been added to our reserve, covering Beijing, Shanghai and Xi'an. Total GFA 12.11 million square meters. Equity premium, HKD 42.58 billion. \r\nThis is the situation for 2014. Beginning from the year until now, we have acquired 7 lots. GFA, 5.285 million square meters; equity premium, HKD 17.57 billion. This is the total landbank situation. In 2013, we have entered for the first time, [indiscernible] Harbin, Fuzhou and Wuxi. In 2014, we entered Zhengzhou. So we have entered 32 first and second tier cities, together with the 14 first tier cities covered by COGO, we have been covering 46 cities. \r\nNext chart, investment property situation. By the end of last year, we have total GFA of 2.6 million square meters and 2 million loaned to commercial properties, taking up 77%. Under operation, 600,000 square meters. Rental situation is very good, covering Hong Kong, Beijing and Chengdu offices and also the Unipark in Jinan. We're talking about over 90% of occupancy rate. And the rental rate has increased. The rental income has increased to HKD 857 million, a growth of 46.5%. \r\nThe next section is about the macro situation. In 2013, as you can see in the chart, these are some economic outlook for China, and I believe that you already have such information, so I won't go through them in great details. The growth came down to 7.7%, but the economic structure is actually more healthy. So the fundamentals are very stable. In the future, urbanization, industrialization will continue. There could be some uncertainties and difficulties, but we trust that the overall quality of our economy will continue to improve with stable growth. \r\nNext, you probably are very concerned about liquidity in the financial market. I trust that you have done a lot of analysis already and therefore, I will not go through the details. Basically, I just have a brief conclusion. We see very stable and healthy fundamentals for fiscal policy and the increase of m2 have slowed down to 13%. So there will be slowing down of loan balances, but it is more than sufficient to support the realization of the annual GDP growth of 7.5%. Taking on with the Golden 10 rules being issued, commercial banks will be more prudent in allocation of their credits. So overall development of the market will be very stable and well balanced. This chart is again about liquidity. As we all know, with the speeding up of the reform measures of the financial system in China, there will be more stringent supervision. So perhaps there will be some fluctuations in 2014. There would be some defaults leading to the possibility of accidental tightening. But there will be a return of the normal situation very quickly. \r\nConcerning overseas markets, many advanced countries have been improving in terms of their economic situation, and there is capital inflow again. The appreciation of renminbi and also the interest spread will not go through fundamental changes in the shorter term. \r\nNext, investment and financing management. You can see some measures we have implemented and also advantages enjoyed by the group. The centralized fund management, we have a dedicated committee responsible for the allocation of funds, so that we are actively responding to any possible risk and changes in the liquidity market. We have a dual platform which continues to be very effective, ensuring healthy flow of funds, and it is sufficient to support our future investment and development. \r\nThis chart, it is about dividends of urbanization and the contribution to GDP growth rate. I'm sure you have plenty of such information so I won't go into any details. \r\nWe are experiencing this great opportunity presented by urbanization. For a very long term, this is going to provide new economic growth point. There will continue to be investment need for infrastructure, public facilities and housing. Third tier cities will continue to benefit from the growth of population, and first and second tier cities will also continue to benefit in terms of industry upgrades and improving of environmental quality. So concentration of population will lead to improvement of living quality, especially it will be reflected in the added value to property sector of the first and second tier cities. \r\nNext, some statistics concerning the property market in the past decade and some outlook information. You will see very stable growth concerning the volume of sales and the price of property. Together with further economic development and urbanization measures, we believe that the 1 billion square meter level will be sustained per year in terms of supply of residential units. We believe that the increase of supply has to be supported by the increase of sales investment. In different places, there could be different structures, so in the future, first and second tier cities will continue to see more or less an equilibrium in the supply and demand structures. \r\nThis chart is about our value chain. Some previous practices. Again, I won't go into the details because I trust that you already know about our past, so I don't want to be very repetitive. \r\nThe final part, guidance and strategy. I trust that you're very concerned about this. So I will tell you some details now. You can see our target for 2014. We would like to sustain 20% growth of our net profit. In terms of completion, we will sustain a very stable progress so that we can control our cost within reasonable limits. 10 million square meters to be completed, plenty of projects. GFA will be 12 million. Contracted sales, we will continue to focus on our target of HKD 148 billion. \r\nI trust that you will ask about this, so I just wanted to provide you with the answer now. Saleable resources, HKD 220 billion. \r\nWe will not casually acquire land without careful considerations. Newly added land reserve, about 10 million square meters; CapEx, HKD 110 billion. HKD 50 billion will go into the newly acquired land. For different projects, HKD 46 billion. Another HKD 14 billion are to be payments for previously acquired land lots. \r\nThis is the final chart. You can see the breakdown for property to be completed because of some requests we have received. You wanted some further breakdowns according to different regions. Anyway, we're happy to disclose this. In Hua Nan, Hua Dong, Northern, Hua Bei, Western and Hong Kong and Macau, you can see the GFA completion targets.  Hopefully, this is more convenient for you to do your calculation analysis. \r\nSo basically, I have taken you through everything. We will now take questions from you. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text3": "We'll now move on to Q&A. For those who have questions, please raise your hand.\n\n---\n\nI have a question for Mr. Hao. It seems like the macro situation, your review is quite cautious. So we just looked at the guidance in terms of sales. Are we too conservative? What about cash expenses? You seem more proactive. If you look at land acquisition, the money involved has increased by 27%. In construction expenses, another increase of 27%. So Mr. Hao, considering sales and expenses, why is there such a discrepancy? In terms of our finances last year, concerning sales absorption rate, and what about on the return of our cash? Final question, on Page 1, gross profit rate, security housing and some other projects have been excluded. So concerning the security housing, is it because in 2013, the ratio of security housing compared to in the previous years, it was quite big, that is why you excluded that portion?\n\n---\n\nCan we know where you're from?\n\n---\n\nI'm from Credit Suisse.\n\n---\n\nI think Horace will provide some answers about the financial figures, and I will take the other questions. First of all, I want to thank you for supporting our macro projection. When it comes to sales and expenses, I would like to tell you 2 things. Traditionally, I'm sure you already know this, that we are always on the conservative side or we're in the middle. Whatever we tell you that we are going to do, we will try to realize it at the end, but it doesn't mean that we're not proactive in moving forward. Last year, many people asked me, you have to make adjustments. Yes, we had to adjust the target because we were approaching our August and September. It doesn't matter what happens in the market, we are trying our best. Whether I shout conservative or not, it really depends on what you think about us. You are there to analyze. You know how much I can sell. For so many years, we have been able to absorb how much of the GFA. I think you already know the answer. Actually, you can do the calculation, and you will know how much I can sell. But I cannot tell you because if I do tell you, it's a kind of undertaking. It's just up for you to judge. This is the rule of the game, isn't it? So according to your understanding of our group, you should know this is not a problem. When it comes to our financial arrangements, HKD 110 billion CapEx, so on and so forth, you would know the cash level coming back. We're talking about HKD 138.5 billion in terms of contracted sales including COGO. Do you mean -- do you know what I mean? So we're talking about the relation between 1212 and 1204. So do you think I am being proactive or conservative? Yes, when it comes to financial arrangements, perhaps I am slightly on the conservative side. Whenever there are opportunities, we are ready to strike. You should understand that we do leave some leeway. And in the past, we have been making expenses while understanding how much we have at hand. So that's what we have been doing in the past decade. You talked about gross profit rate. Well, actually, I was trying to tell the reporters about this. The 3 security housing projects, where are they located? One is in [indiscernible], Shenzhen. It is a purely security-oriented project. It's been constructed because of the request by the government. Another one in Beijing, grade 1 development. Normally, the return level is no more than 8%. So why do we get involved? Because we wanted to obtain grade 2 land lots. You should know about our projects sold last year. How much was sold? 4,500 for the security housing units and then another project in Qingdao. So that also covers some units with a rental level which is very low. So altogether, we are talking about less than 8 billion. So basically, the situation is satisfactory. There are no problems. So what is our target? I'm not just bluffing. We do have sufficient resources at hand, but I cannot give you any undertaking because, every year, the receivables are different. Perhaps, sometimes, we get a better level in the southern part, sometimes, in the northern region. This is why for many companies, their performance is not stable. We are talking about very large-scale developments. It is very difficult to manage a very stable level of sales every year. For so many years, we have sustained stable growth and that is very difficult to achieve. Even if you don't say any nice things about me, I want to say something nice about myself. I think I deserve a round of applause. It's very difficult. So yes, indeed, the security housing projects are quite unusual. And today, we have a project in Jinan. It is a large-scale project. We don't know how to calculate that at the moment. If you break it down, perhaps you can see the core profitability, where that is coming from. And I want to see if Horace would like to say anything?\n\n---\n\nNothing to add. For 2012, we had 80% unbooked. And last year, the level was 90%. It can never be 100%. For the JV project, it was HKD 120 billion.\n\n---\n\nI don't know what's happening to other companies. But I trust that sustainable development of a company are very much dependent on the flowback of cash.\n\n---\n\nMr. Hao, I'm Eric [ph] from JTG [ph]. I have 2 questions. First, a macroeconomic question. You talked about a new round of urbanization. Perhaps, that is very important for future development of the company. So what is this new emerging urbanization? How do you interpret this? We have seen some statistics showing GFA sold in the last 2 months. It's more or less the same compared to previous years, but for large cities, we're talking about a drop of 10%. Perhaps, the fourth tier cities are catching up with very good growth. So I would like to ask you, Mr. Hao, what do you think will happen in the market? Second question, payout ratio. We see this payout ratio of about 20%. Well, your competitor increased their payout ratio to 30%. So what is the impact on China overseas? Are you going to adjust the payout ratio of 20%? Are you going to increase it? The sales condition is 6:4 for first half and second half. What about this year? Are we going to maintain the same ratio?\n\n---\n\nThank you for the questions. The first question is a huge topic. I can only offer some comments. The Chinese property market has been developing for more than a decade. Today, I feel it is very versatile and different factors can affect it. That is the situation of the industry. So any across-the-board concepts or comments would not mean much to me. And about the turning point or is it going to crash next year or good performance next year, they were not that meaningful in the past decades. We focused on fundamental demand. For example, you have heard that we tried to resolve fundamental housing needs. After the development of more than a decade, how many property companies existed in the market 10 years ago? What was the total sales level? Compare that to today's situation. You will see that the situation is totally different. So diversification in the market is unavoidable. And it may happen any time. My understanding is, as an enterprise, we should pay more attention to your own resources and your capability. When I attend internal meeting, I said the following, \"We should pay more attention to the opportunities in the market\". What is the level of capability of your management and operational philosophies? You should pay attention on micro things. If you'll continue to focus on the macro level, we can no longer see anything like a property developer who will always make a profit. That era is over in every corner of the city in different regions. You are facing very fierce and direct competition. It will only become more keen. Two years ago, I also shared with you my liking of fluctuations and different situations. Otherwise, you cannot tell the good from the bad. It is not surprising. I think you should divert your attention to larger areas of concern. Perhaps my concerns are different from your concerns because I have adopted this analysis from the corporate perspective. I wonder, you have seen the figures, the 300 million. The first 100 million is about urbanization. We have seen a migration of village population into various cities. The 100 million people moving into cities will continue to have demand for housing. So we need policies to support this movement. And then, our renovation or refurbishment will cover another 100 million. That is creating a lot of pressure to different cities. I think this morning, our Premier talked about removing poverty zones. This is something that we must proceed with. So the 100 million living in poverty regions, they will also be relocated to other cities, presenting us with more opportunities. The last 100 million, we're talking about the movement of people from Western regions to the Eastern regions. So if you put all these figures together, you would understand that these are unprecedented opportunities. People used to say the overseas markets are performing quite well. What is the growth in United States? What about Europe? Do you know? So these are the opportunities presented to us by the new round of urbanization. I still think very positively about the property industry, but can you actually leverage on the opportunities presented in the market? The property business does not necessarily mean you own a gold mine. You need to turn the oil into gold. So further diversification is inevitable, and it's only natural. The second question is about the payout ratio. We wanted to keep it at 20% or more. And for so many years, we have been upholding this payout ratio. Many of our shareholders suggested -- many shareholders said that \"Pay less, develop more\". So we cannot pretend we didn't hear that. So we didn't want to pay too much. If you look at the return for our shareholders, it is much better than the dividend payout, so it's only reasonable for us to not to pay out too much. So we would like to keep it at 20%. And this is one of the principles for the company. You talked about the sales question. What's that again? Oh, yes, for this year -- for last year was 6:4. This year, first half, perhaps a bit more. Maybe between 60% to 70%. For the second half, 30% to 40%. The actual split, well, it's depending on the timing of us obtaining the permits for presale. So there are many of such projects in June. So roughly speaking, 60% to 70% for the first half, 30% to 40% in second half. That is the allocation of our resources at the moment.\n\n---\n\nMr. Hao, I'm from DBS. My name is Carol. I have 2 questions. The sales condition of the first 2 months, there's a drop compared to 2013. I don't remember seeing this historically. What is the reason? You don't have anything to sell, or you don't want to launch them yet? What is the reason for holding on to such projects? The media's saying that perhaps you cannot supply certain projects because they have not yet been completed. Can you explain the reasons? If you look at acquisition before 2012, the growth was about 1% per year. And then in 2013, there is this sudden surge. First 2 months of 2014 also very substantial land acquisition. What are the reasons driving you to fill the need to expedite land acquisition? Are you more able to sell today and, therefore, you want to acquire more land to propel faster growth? I'm just noticing some difference.\n\n---\n\nAll right. You've asked a few questions. Actually, the sales of the last 2 months, as I have shared with you, January and February in China is very special time because sometimes we have the Chinese New Year in January, sometimes we have it in February. And that affects, to a very big extent, the overall sales condition. The week or longer before Chinese New Year and 1 to 2 weeks after, people just feel bored because they don't have anything else to do. They are taking the time off work so they come to our flats to have a look. They are not real buyers. So don't feel too troubled. It doesn't really show a growth or decline. It's not a matter of holding on to a flat or property or unable to sell. This is not happening. And I can tell you what happened. We did not obtain the presale permits maybe because the price was too high or because of the Chinese New Year. So when we don't have the permits, we cannot sell. And that happened to quite a few of our projects. But in March, things will improve gradually. And then, after the 2 congresses are concluded, we'll look at some new policy directions and we'll address our strategies as well. So basically, we're not holding on to any inventory or our ability [indiscernible] or anything like that. So please don't be too concerned with a drop of 5% or 10%, it's not that meaningful. Your second question is about land acquisition. To be honest, in 2013, our target is 8 million square meters. Last year, we acquired 12.11 million. I wonder if you have looked at the breakdowns. That covered 4 projects, taking up 6 million square meters. Shenyang, Changchun, Yantai and another one in, I think, Nanjing, that international community. Just these 4 projects took up 6 million square meters. So we're talking about projects under negotiation. These are 4 mega scale projects. The Nanjing one, almost 1 million square meters. The one in Changchun, 1.2 million, 1.3 million, and then, Shenyang, 2.3 million, and Yantai a little over 1 million. The land premium is not that high. Most of them only went out 700, 800, the one in Shenyang 2,000 only. So in the past, we have used a small amount of resources to obtain very quality inventory that will support very positive growth in the future. If you look at our financial situation, as I presented, we have plenty at hand. We can buy more if we want. For example, when everyone wants to buy, we take a step back and stay calm. But I can tell you, I feel in January and February, many companies went out of cash. So the situation in Guangdong last year, well, many companies actually withdrew from the bidding process because of the lack of funds. So it is really about finding the right opportunities. So it is not about changing our operating philosophies or strategies. We are just doing what is normal. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThank you very much. Next question? In the middle.\n\n---\n\nI'm Brian from Morgan Stanley. First question, land acquisition. 10 million square meters to be acquired in 2014 at the value of HKD 50 billion. Are you talking about more premium land lots closer to first and second tier cities? That's the first question. Second question, the 2013 acquisition level was the highest. And then 2014 perhaps another new heights. So after 1 to 2 years of acquisition, we should be able to see huge increases in sales level. So can we expect China Overseas to sell a lot more in 2015 and beyond? That is the second question. And third question is about profit growth. According to your budgets, in 2014, the completion rate will increase by 11%, and profit will also increase. Does it mean that the profit level in 2014 will represent a very huge increase over 2013?\n\n---\n\nWell, thank you for the questions, to be honest. Land acquisitions, yes, it was a high level. And for 2014, are we buying premium land lots? Well, all these are projections. Perhaps, we feel that there are good opportunities. And therefore, we have made the financial arrangements or even we feel that there are some very good opportunities in the market. I'm quite surprised that you saw right through us. Well, that is exactly the reason why we have made the financial arrangements. But of course, sometimes construing the kind of projection, it's a kind of guessing. So I'm hoping what you see is the same as what we see. So hopefully, it is going to be a year of very good harvest. Growth in sales and profits. Well, we talked about 20%. But in actual arrangement, we did more, or at the end, we cannot complete the projects. So I think what you're thinking is the same as what I am thinking. I will definitely reserve more. It is a kind of insurance or security. I think our judgment is very much aligned. But there are things that I cannot say but you have said them for me. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nNext question in the front, the third row.\n\n---\n\nI'm Oscar from [indiscernible]. Two questions. Just now, Mr. Hao mentioned the future will be very diversified. We need to look at competitiveness. In the past 2 to 3 years, some market leaders have launched strategies moving abroad or providing supporting services or they have geared towards the commercial sector. So in the near future, the situation will be very diverse. What strategies do you have? What do you think about the 3 strategies I have mentioned? Move toward commercial segments or go overseas? And what about our soft services in enhancing your competitiveness? In August, the mother company made this announcement for 688 in terms of integration with the mother company platform or the interactions with the mother company. Any new progress? Third question is about COGO. In the past year, we've seen very good development of COGO. It is now an associate from the perspective of 688, perhaps, because of accountability. How are you going to view COGO at the moment?\n\n---\n\nThank you for the very good questions and quite difficult to answer, but I think we can make the following exchanges. Well, every person will have different views. At the press conference many reporters asked about similar questions. Network property or finance property and then another term, very liberated ideas, we're talking about people in the early 20s. There were so many terms. And I said, \"You must understand what that means\". They are talking to me with Internet language. Actually, we will only do what we know and what we are good at. Going overseas? How big is this market? In China, 300 million people are waiting to be housed. I'm not saying that going overseas is a bad idea. But if you're in the property sector, you must know the country, you need to know the local laws, the local customs and local people. If you want to be successful, you have to rely on these local knowledge. I know you work in multinational enterprises. Perhaps, you can help me out. I haven't heard much good news concerning with these markets. So let's just wait and see, perhaps I am more conservative. I just want to do what I'm good at and what I understand. So that is our core competitiveness. So in order to sustain stable growth, we need to minimize the risk. We must have manageable risk. And you talked about diversity just like what the reporters have said. They kept talking about the Internet. I don't really understand. I can't talk in Internet language. I just want to be careful and focus on what we truly understand. That is the direction and objective for our group. You talked about the commercial segment. Perhaps, I haven't told you much about this. Perhaps, I can disclose something. We have focused on the macro situation. In the next 5 years, we would like to take up 20% of market share. It's not empty talk. We are doing it, perhaps you don't feel it. I can share with you some figures this year: under operations, 600,000 square meters commercial space. In 2014, 650,000, and then, in 2015, 1 million and 3.8 million office space. In the coming 2 years, 2.2 million will be completed. Another 2 million-odd square meters to be completed in the following 2 or 3 years. We have been doing something that covers 2 directions of development, so we want to continue to walk on 2 legs. Commercial property is like having a daughter. Many developers have been focusing on the commercial segment with too much focus sometimes. You need to consider all the different elements. Otherwise in the future, it will become your burden. It will eat into your financial resources, and you cannot get rid of them. When you develop and accumulate to a certain level, when it becomes a burden, it will become a huge burden and you will be truly terrified. We don't want to go down that path. We want to be stable in our growth. We want to only create good property with good return. Right now, the rental to cost ratio is about 15%. Within 10 years, we need to break even and we can achieve that. The practical life is 70%. If you cannot break even in 10 years, you cannot make any good profit. So commercial property has taken up a healthy portion of about 20% of our total business. You talked about capital injection, I have already disclosed everything that I am permitted to. So it's not me refusing to tell you. Sometimes, we need time for the different departments to complete the funding [ph] procedures. So in terms of capital and technical support, we have been receiving them from our mother company in a continuous manner. So it just takes time. Please believe us. We would like to complete the deals as quickly as possible. Do you want me to go slowly? Does anyone want us to go slowly? No? Then we will move ahead. But it doesn't mean we can control the speed. Perhaps, we need 3 years for a certain contract. When can we actually complete them? When I have something that can be disclosed, I will tell you right away. So I have to ask you to wait. Is it going to be 1 year, 1.5 years? You also talked about our mother company in other aspects. Perhaps I can invite the chairman of the mother company to join us one day and you can just listen to him. I can only tell you that our mother company has provided great support to us. So I will try to invite him over next time. See if you can get anything out of him instead, okay? Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThank you. Next question?\n\n---\n\nThere was another question, about COGO. Yes, I totally forgot. I'm sorry, it wasn't intentional. I really just forgot. Beginning from the day of acquisition of COGO, COLI has been seeing it as an effective extension of our business in terms of branding and also performance growth. I've already talked about this in the past. COGO is getting a lot of support from COLI. We only have a handful of companies while others may have dozens of companies because we want to be deeply rooted in where we belong. Many changes will continue to take place in the property industry. In a mature and sophisticated enterprise, sustaining very good growth, we'll have to think about what it is good at. How to maximize your resources, utilization. That may be different in different cities, and it may be different for different projects. Gradually, you will feel what I am saying. They could be 2 companies of similar scale and reserve, and in the same city they may have very different performance. We were talking about Hangzhou in January. I can tell you the story. The company cutting prices. They sold the property. They obtained the money, they bid for another also in the same city three days later. It was in the same city, but different districts, different projects. So to be more straightforward, if you want to be successful, you cannot keep making the same mistakes. Otherwise, it's almost impossible to sustain growth or good performance. The error rates cannot be over 10%, otherwise your performance would be affected. So I would like to ask you how many companies can actually keep it at 10%? COGO has seen -- COLI has seen COGO as a very important extension of our business. But since no reporters are here, we can talk about whether COLI wants to sell it. How is that possible? We said so. It's developing so well. I remember last year, I told you, I'm very delighted that they really understand how to survive and develop in a third tier city. They have really found a way. We need different methodologies and different concepts for different places. Some other companies, they want to do this city and tomorrow they want to shift to another city. They don't even know what they are doing. Their performance will suffer. We're talking about development in different regions with a separation of more than 10 years. So I suppose I have already answered the last of your question without violating the Hong Kong Exchanges rules. Anymore questions? Well, I can tell you we will continue to support COGO's development. Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\nNext question?\n\n---\n\nI am Jack, I have a few questions. Last year, according to original plan, saleable inventory and the actual inventory sold, any discrepancy? And secondly, about strategies. Oscar actually asked about the commercial segment. Have you thought about collaborating with some funds so as to alleviate the financial burden? And then about SOE reforms. Are local SOEs -- are you going to consider collaborating with them? And then, what about Internet thinking? It changes the industry's profit rates. So some enterprises may choose to lower their profit rate to have cutthroat competition. What about in the PPT, in the past 10 years, we see this rising trend. I think domestic demand has driven growth in the sector. For 2013, 2014 as Mr. [indiscernible] Chang have said that we have to sustain the level of 7.5%. How do you understand the 7.5%? Do you see some new opportunities in the market?\n\n---\n\n2013, HKD 187 billion. Well, our sold-out rate was about 75% to 80%. Basically, around 80%. I don't think we have gone beyond 70%. Otherwise, our financial situation will be very difficult because we pursue high sold-out rates. When it comes to commercial segment, you can have a rate project or collaborate with another entity. I think stable cash flow is very important. We need the capital. But of course, the rating organizations will have something to say. So we are looking at ownership of the property and also taking in rental income. This is not a burden to us and, therefore, in the past, I've already told you about this. Your financial situation or the project you face will be very different considering how much commercial property you own. We have gathered some information recently. Some property enterprises have decided to quit. They wanted to sell the business. We have obtained some information. Is it going to be a trend or there will be more opportunities? We will have to wait and see. And then, Internet, is it affecting our business? Of course, I know how people spend is being chased by the Internet. I am still learning. And I hope you understand now this. For the property sector, there are simply too many uncertainties. First of all, it is not investment. It is not manufacturing. Property sector combines different things. So you cannot compare it with any other industry. It is not a good comparison. Through the use of Internet and IT measures, perhaps we can promote changes in some parts of our business. Perhaps, that is very reasonable because we already have the social resources at hand. So GDP ratio, I don't even know where to begin. It's such a huge topic. Are you saying that the Opera [ph] sector is kidnapping the Chinese economy? Or this person is not using a mic, the interpreter cannot hear. Nothing is coming through.  Well, first of all. Development of the Chinese company according to some economic data, we can see 7.5% growth or more will mean stable growth. Perhaps, there's some conspiracy theory. I don't know, but I think stable growth of Chinese economy with a good structure is achievable. We have the fundamentals. We have the data supporting this. This is all along what I think. You talked about some conspiracies. And so I have said, anything across-the-board, anything positive and negative but if it is across-the-board, don't pay too much attention to it. It is not objective. Some people will say, \"Oh, it is going to collapse\". How can you say so? Unless the Earth is going to explode. Some people just want to terrify others. It is not rational. We have to look at the real situation and all the relevant elements. Perhaps, if you're a news reporter, you would like to hear something shocking. Yes, it will collapse tomorrow. It will be the headline on the newspaper. It has value because they're selling newspaper but you are rational people here, aren't you? Thank you very much for the questions.\n\n---\n\nFinal question?\n\n---\n\nMr. Hao, you talked about 300 million people creating huge demand. They're from the West or poor areas. What about the affordability? How are they going to propel further urbanization? So I really want to ask about the affordability of these 300 million people. Is it going to create any pressure on the company?\n\n---\n\nWhere are you from?\n\n---\n\nChinese University, Hong Kong.\n\n---\n\nResearch institution. So we have the same background. Thank you for the question. 300 million. Yes, indeed, affordability is different. In different cities, there will be different situations. The peripheral of first and second tier cities, that kind of urbanization represent a very good purchasing power. If you are talking about small to medium cities, of course, purchasing power will be smaller. But then the property prices are cheaper. So we're talking about very good resources. And then, with the strongest purchasing power will be someone in the middle. They would like to have a -- if you all like to have a bigger house in a large city, it's going to be very expensive. It can be quite scary. Relocation compensation maybe huge because demolition cost per square meter is HKD 80,000 to HKD 100,000. But if you go to Xuzhou to purchase your home, it's different from purchasing a home in downtown Shanghai. And then, for those coming from the Western region, perhaps they would belong to category 1. Purchasing power and demand really depends on the person's preference. Thank you very much for the question.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Mr. Hao and the management. This is the end of our meeting. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text4": "【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nWe'll now move on to Q&A. For those who have questions, please raise your hand.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nI have a question for Mr. Hao. It seems like the macro situation, your review is quite cautious. So we just looked at the guidance in terms of sales. Are we too conservative? What about cash expenses? You seem more proactive. If you look at land acquisition, the money involved has increased by 27%. In construction expenses, another increase of 27%. So Mr. Hao, considering sales and expenses, why is there such a discrepancy? In terms of our finances last year, concerning sales absorption rate, and what about on the return of our cash? Final question, on Page 1, gross profit rate, security housing and some other projects have been excluded. So concerning the security housing, is it because in 2013, the ratio of security housing compared to in the previous years, it was quite big, that is why you excluded that portion?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jian Min Hao (Executives)】\nCan we know where you're from?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nI'm from Credit Suisse.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jian Min Hao (Executives)】\nI think Horace will provide some answers about the financial figures, and I will take the other questions. First of all, I want to thank you for supporting our macro projection. When it comes to sales and expenses, I would like to tell you 2 things. Traditionally, I'm sure you already know this, that we are always on the conservative side or we're in the middle. Whatever we tell you that we are going to do, we will try to realize it at the end, but it doesn't mean that we're not proactive in moving forward. Last year, many people asked me, you have to make adjustments. Yes, we had to adjust the target because we were approaching our August and September. It doesn't matter what happens in the market, we are trying our best. Whether I shout conservative or not, it really depends on what you think about us. You are there to analyze. You know how much I can sell. For so many years, we have been able to absorb how much of the GFA. I think you already know the answer. Actually, you can do the calculation, and you will know how much I can sell. But I cannot tell you because if I do tell you, it's a kind of undertaking. It's just up for you to judge. This is the rule of the game, isn't it? So according to your understanding of our group, you should know this is not a problem. When it comes to our financial arrangements, HKD 110 billion CapEx, so on and so forth, you would know the cash level coming back. We're talking about HKD 138.5 billion in terms of contracted sales including COGO. Do you mean -- do you know what I mean? So we're talking about the relation between 1212 and 1204. So do you think I am being proactive or conservative? Yes, when it comes to financial arrangements, perhaps I am slightly on the conservative side. Whenever there are opportunities, we are ready to strike. You should understand that we do leave some leeway. And in the past, we have been making expenses while understanding how much we have at hand. So that's what we have been doing in the past decade. You talked about gross profit rate. Well, actually, I was trying to tell the reporters about this. The 3 security housing projects, where are they located? One is in [indiscernible], Shenzhen. It is a purely security-oriented project. It's been constructed because of the request by the government. Another one in Beijing, grade 1 development. Normally, the return level is no more than 8%. So why do we get involved? Because we wanted to obtain grade 2 land lots. You should know about our projects sold last year. How much was sold? 4,500 for the security housing units and then another project in Qingdao. So that also covers some units with a rental level which is very low. So altogether, we are talking about less than 8 billion. So basically, the situation is satisfactory. There are no problems. So what is our target? I'm not just bluffing. We do have sufficient resources at hand, but I cannot give you any undertaking because, every year, the receivables are different. Perhaps, sometimes, we get a better level in the southern part, sometimes, in the northern region. This is why for many companies, their performance is not stable. We are talking about very large-scale developments. It is very difficult to manage a very stable level of sales every year. For so many years, we have sustained stable growth and that is very difficult to achieve. Even if you don't say any nice things about me, I want to say something nice about myself. I think I deserve a round of applause. It's very difficult. So yes, indeed, the security housing projects are quite unusual. And today, we have a project in Jinan. It is a large-scale project. We don't know how to calculate that at the moment. If you break it down, perhaps you can see the core profitability, where that is coming from. And I want to see if Horace would like to say anything?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Yun Wing Nip (Executives)】\nNothing to add. For 2012, we had 80% unbooked. And last year, the level was 90%. It can never be 100%. For the JV project, it was HKD 120 billion.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jian Min Hao (Executives)】\nI don't know what's happening to other companies. But I trust that sustainable development of a company are very much dependent on the flowback of cash.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nMr. Hao, I'm Eric [ph] from JTG [ph]. I have 2 questions. First, a macroeconomic question. You talked about a new round of urbanization. Perhaps, that is very important for future development of the company. So what is this new emerging urbanization? How do you interpret this? We have seen some statistics showing GFA sold in the last 2 months. It's more or less the same compared to previous years, but for large cities, we're talking about a drop of 10%. Perhaps, the fourth tier cities are catching up with very good growth. So I would like to ask you, Mr. Hao, what do you think will happen in the market? Second question, payout ratio. We see this payout ratio of about 20%. Well, your competitor increased their payout ratio to 30%. So what is the impact on China overseas? Are you going to adjust the payout ratio of 20%? Are you going to increase it? The sales condition is 6:4 for first half and second half. What about this year? Are we going to maintain the same ratio?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jian Min Hao (Executives)】\nThank you for the questions. The first question is a huge topic. I can only offer some comments. The Chinese property market has been developing for more than a decade. Today, I feel it is very versatile and different factors can affect it. That is the situation of the industry. So any across-the-board concepts or comments would not mean much to me. And about the turning point or is it going to crash next year or good performance next year, they were not that meaningful in the past decades. We focused on fundamental demand. For example, you have heard that we tried to resolve fundamental housing needs. After the development of more than a decade, how many property companies existed in the market 10 years ago? What was the total sales level? Compare that to today's situation. You will see that the situation is totally different. So diversification in the market is unavoidable. And it may happen any time. My understanding is, as an enterprise, we should pay more attention to your own resources and your capability. When I attend internal meeting, I said the following, \"We should pay more attention to the opportunities in the market\". What is the level of capability of your management and operational philosophies? You should pay attention on micro things. If you'll continue to focus on the macro level, we can no longer see anything like a property developer who will always make a profit. That era is over in every corner of the city in different regions. You are facing very fierce and direct competition. It will only become more keen. Two years ago, I also shared with you my liking of fluctuations and different situations. Otherwise, you cannot tell the good from the bad. It is not surprising. I think you should divert your attention to larger areas of concern. Perhaps my concerns are different from your concerns because I have adopted this analysis from the corporate perspective. I wonder, you have seen the figures, the 300 million. The first 100 million is about urbanization. We have seen a migration of village population into various cities. The 100 million people moving into cities will continue to have demand for housing. So we need policies to support this movement. And then, our renovation or refurbishment will cover another 100 million. That is creating a lot of pressure to different cities. I think this morning, our Premier talked about removing poverty zones. This is something that we must proceed with. So the 100 million living in poverty regions, they will also be relocated to other cities, presenting us with more opportunities. The last 100 million, we're talking about the movement of people from Western regions to the Eastern regions. So if you put all these figures together, you would understand that these are unprecedented opportunities. People used to say the overseas markets are performing quite well. What is the growth in United States? What about Europe? Do you know? So these are the opportunities presented to us by the new round of urbanization. I still think very positively about the property industry, but can you actually leverage on the opportunities presented in the market? The property business does not necessarily mean you own a gold mine. You need to turn the oil into gold. So further diversification is inevitable, and it's only natural. The second question is about the payout ratio. We wanted to keep it at 20% or more. And for so many years, we have been upholding this payout ratio. Many of our shareholders suggested -- many shareholders said that \"Pay less, develop more\". So we cannot pretend we didn't hear that. So we didn't want to pay too much. If you look at the return for our shareholders, it is much better than the dividend payout, so it's only reasonable for us to not to pay out too much. So we would like to keep it at 20%. And this is one of the principles for the company. You talked about the sales question. What's that again? Oh, yes, for this year -- for last year was 6:4. This year, first half, perhaps a bit more. Maybe between 60% to 70%. For the second half, 30% to 40%. The actual split, well, it's depending on the timing of us obtaining the permits for presale. So there are many of such projects in June. So roughly speaking, 60% to 70% for the first half, 30% to 40% in second half. That is the allocation of our resources at the moment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Carol Wu (Analysts)】\nMr. Hao, I'm from DBS. My name is Carol. I have 2 questions. The sales condition of the first 2 months, there's a drop compared to 2013. I don't remember seeing this historically. What is the reason? You don't have anything to sell, or you don't want to launch them yet? What is the reason for holding on to such projects? The media's saying that perhaps you cannot supply certain projects because they have not yet been completed. Can you explain the reasons? If you look at acquisition before 2012, the growth was about 1% per year. And then in 2013, there is this sudden surge. First 2 months of 2014 also very substantial land acquisition. What are the reasons driving you to fill the need to expedite land acquisition? Are you more able to sell today and, therefore, you want to acquire more land to propel faster growth? I'm just noticing some difference.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jian Min Hao (Executives)】\nAll right. You've asked a few questions. Actually, the sales of the last 2 months, as I have shared with you, January and February in China is very special time because sometimes we have the Chinese New Year in January, sometimes we have it in February. And that affects, to a very big extent, the overall sales condition. The week or longer before Chinese New Year and 1 to 2 weeks after, people just feel bored because they don't have anything else to do. They are taking the time off work so they come to our flats to have a look. They are not real buyers. So don't feel too troubled. It doesn't really show a growth or decline. It's not a matter of holding on to a flat or property or unable to sell. This is not happening. And I can tell you what happened. We did not obtain the presale permits maybe because the price was too high or because of the Chinese New Year. So when we don't have the permits, we cannot sell. And that happened to quite a few of our projects. But in March, things will improve gradually. And then, after the 2 congresses are concluded, we'll look at some new policy directions and we'll address our strategies as well. So basically, we're not holding on to any inventory or our ability [indiscernible] or anything like that. So please don't be too concerned with a drop of 5% or 10%, it's not that meaningful. Your second question is about land acquisition. To be honest, in 2013, our target is 8 million square meters. Last year, we acquired 12.11 million. I wonder if you have looked at the breakdowns. That covered 4 projects, taking up 6 million square meters. Shenyang, Changchun, Yantai and another one in, I think, Nanjing, that international community. Just these 4 projects took up 6 million square meters. So we're talking about projects under negotiation. These are 4 mega scale projects. The Nanjing one, almost 1 million square meters. The one in Changchun, 1.2 million, 1.3 million, and then, Shenyang, 2.3 million, and Yantai a little over 1 million. The land premium is not that high. Most of them only went out 700, 800, the one in Shenyang 2,000 only. So in the past, we have used a small amount of resources to obtain very quality inventory that will support very positive growth in the future. If you look at our financial situation, as I presented, we have plenty at hand. We can buy more if we want. For example, when everyone wants to buy, we take a step back and stay calm. But I can tell you, I feel in January and February, many companies went out of cash. So the situation in Guangdong last year, well, many companies actually withdrew from the bidding process because of the lack of funds. So it is really about finding the right opportunities. So it is not about changing our operating philosophies or strategies. We are just doing what is normal. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nThank you very much. Next question? In the middle.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Leung (Analysts)】\nI'm Brian from Morgan Stanley. First question, land acquisition. 10 million square meters to be acquired in 2014 at the value of HKD 50 billion. Are you talking about more premium land lots closer to first and second tier cities? That's the first question. Second question, the 2013 acquisition level was the highest. And then 2014 perhaps another new heights. So after 1 to 2 years of acquisition, we should be able to see huge increases in sales level. So can we expect China Overseas to sell a lot more in 2015 and beyond? That is the second question. And third question is about profit growth. According to your budgets, in 2014, the completion rate will increase by 11%, and profit will also increase. Does it mean that the profit level in 2014 will represent a very huge increase over 2013?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jian Min Hao (Executives)】\nWell, thank you for the questions, to be honest. Land acquisitions, yes, it was a high level. And for 2014, are we buying premium land lots? Well, all these are projections. Perhaps, we feel that there are good opportunities. And therefore, we have made the financial arrangements or even we feel that there are some very good opportunities in the market. I'm quite surprised that you saw right through us. Well, that is exactly the reason why we have made the financial arrangements. But of course, sometimes construing the kind of projection, it's a kind of guessing. So I'm hoping what you see is the same as what we see. So hopefully, it is going to be a year of very good harvest. Growth in sales and profits. Well, we talked about 20%. But in actual arrangement, we did more, or at the end, we cannot complete the projects. So I think what you're thinking is the same as what I am thinking. I will definitely reserve more. It is a kind of insurance or security. I think our judgment is very much aligned. But there are things that I cannot say but you have said them for me. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nNext question in the front, the third row.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nI'm Oscar from [indiscernible]. Two questions. Just now, Mr. Hao mentioned the future will be very diversified. We need to look at competitiveness. In the past 2 to 3 years, some market leaders have launched strategies moving abroad or providing supporting services or they have geared towards the commercial sector. So in the near future, the situation will be very diverse. What strategies do you have? What do you think about the 3 strategies I have mentioned? Move toward commercial segments or go overseas? And what about our soft services in enhancing your competitiveness? In August, the mother company made this announcement for 688 in terms of integration with the mother company platform or the interactions with the mother company. Any new progress? Third question is about COGO. In the past year, we've seen very good development of COGO. It is now an associate from the perspective of 688, perhaps, because of accountability. How are you going to view COGO at the moment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jian Min Hao (Executives)】\nThank you for the very good questions and quite difficult to answer, but I think we can make the following exchanges. Well, every person will have different views. At the press conference many reporters asked about similar questions. Network property or finance property and then another term, very liberated ideas, we're talking about people in the early 20s. There were so many terms. And I said, \"You must understand what that means\". They are talking to me with Internet language. Actually, we will only do what we know and what we are good at. Going overseas? How big is this market? In China, 300 million people are waiting to be housed. I'm not saying that going overseas is a bad idea. But if you're in the property sector, you must know the country, you need to know the local laws, the local customs and local people. If you want to be successful, you have to rely on these local knowledge. I know you work in multinational enterprises. Perhaps, you can help me out. I haven't heard much good news concerning with these markets. So let's just wait and see, perhaps I am more conservative. I just want to do what I'm good at and what I understand. So that is our core competitiveness. So in order to sustain stable growth, we need to minimize the risk. We must have manageable risk. And you talked about diversity just like what the reporters have said. They kept talking about the Internet. I don't really understand. I can't talk in Internet language. I just want to be careful and focus on what we truly understand. That is the direction and objective for our group. You talked about the commercial segment. Perhaps, I haven't told you much about this. Perhaps, I can disclose something. We have focused on the macro situation. In the next 5 years, we would like to take up 20% of market share. It's not empty talk. We are doing it, perhaps you don't feel it. I can share with you some figures this year: under operations, 600,000 square meters commercial space. In 2014, 650,000, and then, in 2015, 1 million and 3.8 million office space. In the coming 2 years, 2.2 million will be completed. Another 2 million-odd square meters to be completed in the following 2 or 3 years. We have been doing something that covers 2 directions of development, so we want to continue to walk on 2 legs. Commercial property is like having a daughter. Many developers have been focusing on the commercial segment with too much focus sometimes. You need to consider all the different elements. Otherwise in the future, it will become your burden. It will eat into your financial resources, and you cannot get rid of them. When you develop and accumulate to a certain level, when it becomes a burden, it will become a huge burden and you will be truly terrified. We don't want to go down that path. We want to be stable in our growth. We want to only create good property with good return. Right now, the rental to cost ratio is about 15%. Within 10 years, we need to break even and we can achieve that. The practical life is 70%. If you cannot break even in 10 years, you cannot make any good profit. So commercial property has taken up a healthy portion of about 20% of our total business. You talked about capital injection, I have already disclosed everything that I am permitted to. So it's not me refusing to tell you. Sometimes, we need time for the different departments to complete the funding [ph] procedures. So in terms of capital and technical support, we have been receiving them from our mother company in a continuous manner. So it just takes time. Please believe us. We would like to complete the deals as quickly as possible. Do you want me to go slowly? Does anyone want us to go slowly? No? Then we will move ahead. But it doesn't mean we can control the speed. Perhaps, we need 3 years for a certain contract. When can we actually complete them? When I have something that can be disclosed, I will tell you right away. So I have to ask you to wait. Is it going to be 1 year, 1.5 years? You also talked about our mother company in other aspects. Perhaps I can invite the chairman of the mother company to join us one day and you can just listen to him. I can only tell you that our mother company has provided great support to us. So I will try to invite him over next time. See if you can get anything out of him instead, okay? Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nThank you. Next question?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jian Min Hao (Executives)】\nThere was another question, about COGO. Yes, I totally forgot. I'm sorry, it wasn't intentional. I really just forgot. Beginning from the day of acquisition of COGO, COLI has been seeing it as an effective extension of our business in terms of branding and also performance growth. I've already talked about this in the past. COGO is getting a lot of support from COLI. We only have a handful of companies while others may have dozens of companies because we want to be deeply rooted in where we belong. Many changes will continue to take place in the property industry. In a mature and sophisticated enterprise, sustaining very good growth, we'll have to think about what it is good at. How to maximize your resources, utilization. That may be different in different cities, and it may be different for different projects. Gradually, you will feel what I am saying. They could be 2 companies of similar scale and reserve, and in the same city they may have very different performance. We were talking about Hangzhou in January. I can tell you the story. The company cutting prices. They sold the property. They obtained the money, they bid for another also in the same city three days later. It was in the same city, but different districts, different projects. So to be more straightforward, if you want to be successful, you cannot keep making the same mistakes. Otherwise, it's almost impossible to sustain growth or good performance. The error rates cannot be over 10%, otherwise your performance would be affected. So I would like to ask you how many companies can actually keep it at 10%? COGO has seen -- COLI has seen COGO as a very important extension of our business. But since no reporters are here, we can talk about whether COLI wants to sell it. How is that possible? We said so. It's developing so well. I remember last year, I told you, I'm very delighted that they really understand how to survive and develop in a third tier city. They have really found a way. We need different methodologies and different concepts for different places. Some other companies, they want to do this city and tomorrow they want to shift to another city. They don't even know what they are doing. Their performance will suffer. We're talking about development in different regions with a separation of more than 10 years. So I suppose I have already answered the last of your question without violating the Hong Kong Exchanges rules. Anymore questions? Well, I can tell you we will continue to support COGO's development. Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nNext question?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nI am Jack, I have a few questions. Last year, according to original plan, saleable inventory and the actual inventory sold, any discrepancy? And secondly, about strategies. Oscar actually asked about the commercial segment. Have you thought about collaborating with some funds so as to alleviate the financial burden? And then about SOE reforms. Are local SOEs -- are you going to consider collaborating with them? And then, what about Internet thinking? It changes the industry's profit rates. So some enterprises may choose to lower their profit rate to have cutthroat competition. What about in the PPT, in the past 10 years, we see this rising trend. I think domestic demand has driven growth in the sector. For 2013, 2014 as Mr. [indiscernible] Chang have said that we have to sustain the level of 7.5%. How do you understand the 7.5%? Do you see some new opportunities in the market?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jian Min Hao (Executives)】\n2013, HKD 187 billion. Well, our sold-out rate was about 75% to 80%. Basically, around 80%. I don't think we have gone beyond 70%. Otherwise, our financial situation will be very difficult because we pursue high sold-out rates. When it comes to commercial segment, you can have a rate project or collaborate with another entity. I think stable cash flow is very important. We need the capital. But of course, the rating organizations will have something to say. So we are looking at ownership of the property and also taking in rental income. This is not a burden to us and, therefore, in the past, I've already told you about this. Your financial situation or the project you face will be very different considering how much commercial property you own. We have gathered some information recently. Some property enterprises have decided to quit. They wanted to sell the business. We have obtained some information. Is it going to be a trend or there will be more opportunities? We will have to wait and see. And then, Internet, is it affecting our business? Of course, I know how people spend is being chased by the Internet. I am still learning. And I hope you understand now this. For the property sector, there are simply too many uncertainties. First of all, it is not investment. It is not manufacturing. Property sector combines different things. So you cannot compare it with any other industry. It is not a good comparison. Through the use of Internet and IT measures, perhaps we can promote changes in some parts of our business. Perhaps, that is very reasonable because we already have the social resources at hand. So GDP ratio, I don't even know where to begin. It's such a huge topic. Are you saying that the Opera [ph] sector is kidnapping the Chinese economy? Or this person is not using a mic, the interpreter cannot hear. Nothing is coming through.  Well, first of all. Development of the Chinese company according to some economic data, we can see 7.5% growth or more will mean stable growth. Perhaps, there's some conspiracy theory. I don't know, but I think stable growth of Chinese economy with a good structure is achievable. We have the fundamentals. We have the data supporting this. This is all along what I think. You talked about some conspiracies. And so I have said, anything across-the-board, anything positive and negative but if it is across-the-board, don't pay too much attention to it. It is not objective. Some people will say, \"Oh, it is going to collapse\". How can you say so? Unless the Earth is going to explode. Some people just want to terrify others. It is not rational. We have to look at the real situation and all the relevant elements. Perhaps, if you're a news reporter, you would like to hear something shocking. Yes, it will collapse tomorrow. It will be the headline on the newspaper. It has value because they're selling newspaper but you are rational people here, aren't you? Thank you very much for the questions.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nFinal question?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nMr. Hao, you talked about 300 million people creating huge demand. They're from the West or poor areas. What about the affordability? How are they going to propel further urbanization? So I really want to ask about the affordability of these 300 million people. Is it going to create any pressure on the company?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jian Min Hao (Executives)】\nWhere are you from?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nChinese University, Hong Kong.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jian Min Hao (Executives)】\nResearch institution. So we have the same background. Thank you for the question. 300 million. Yes, indeed, affordability is different. In different cities, there will be different situations. The peripheral of first and second tier cities, that kind of urbanization represent a very good purchasing power. If you are talking about small to medium cities, of course, purchasing power will be smaller. But then the property prices are cheaper. So we're talking about very good resources. And then, with the strongest purchasing power will be someone in the middle. They would like to have a -- if you all like to have a bigger house in a large city, it's going to be very expensive. It can be quite scary. Relocation compensation maybe huge because demolition cost per square meter is HKD 80,000 to HKD 100,000. But if you go to Xuzhou to purchase your home, it's different from purchasing a home in downtown Shanghai. And then, for those coming from the Western region, perhaps they would belong to category 1. Purchasing power and demand really depends on the person's preference. Thank you very much for the question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nThank you, Mr. Hao and the management. This is the end of our meeting. Thank you.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, operator. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the conference call today. Joining me from Sasol here in Johannesburg are Paul Victor, our acting CFO; Bernard Klingenberg, Group Executive for South African Energy; Riaan Rademan, our Group Executive for Mining and Business Enablement and Ernst Oberholster, Group Executive for International Energy Technology and New Business Development. Also dialing in from our North American head office in Houston is Steve Cornell, Executive Vice President for International Operation; and connecting from our Hamburg office in Germany, Fleetwodd Grobler, Group Executive for Global Chemicals. \r\nToday, we announced another excellent groupwide performance. To contextualize the half year and before we run through the presentation you have in front of you, let me start by reflecting on the recent past. As a company, we've come a long way in the last 2.5 years. Looking back for us at Sasol, FY '12 was all about goal setting and consolidation. During that time, we carefully assessed our areas of competitive advantage and where we could do better. We drove operational improvement and focused on safe, stable and reliable operations. We refined our strategic agenda and narrowed in on 2 broad regional strategies: first, our-nurture-and-grow strategy, primarily here in Southern Africa, where we seek to enhance our strong position in the region; and secondly, our expand-and-deliver strategy, which is underpinned by our North American aspirations and specifically our U.S. growth program. \r\nAt our results announcement in September last year, I told you that our 2013 financial year would be a watershed for Sasol. After all, in FY '13, we consciously moved away from coal to liquids growth and stepped up our gas-to-liquids ambitions. At the same time, we accelerated our low-carbon power generation initiatives and drove safe and more efficient operations. Now as part of this step change, we reprioritized our project pipeline to deliver tangible and sustainable value and crucially, we focused the entire company on a single set of priorities, which included the urgent need to address our cost creep. To ensure that we are a more effective organization, the management team signed off on a redesigned operating model, with simplified structures, streamlined decision-making layers and fit-for-purpose functions. \r\nNow turning to FY '14, from July last year to date, we have been laying a solid foundation across the organization for what will be a new era in Sasol's history. The hard work of the past several years is already paying off. Although in management's view, this is only the beginning. The full benefits of the new Sasol will only be realized from our 2015 financial year onward. The strong results we announced today are a testament to our ability to leverage our unique value proposition, optimizing the macroeconomic impact while managing the factors within our control. \r\nHere, through deliberate interventions, we are increasing volumes, driving business performance enhancements and moving forward on our strategic growth projects. \r\nTurning to Slide 4. Let me start with an overview of what you'll hear today. I'll begin by providing you with a snapshot of how we are creating long-term shareholder value. Next, under the heading of delivery and growth, I'll highlight the key milestones we achieved during the first half of the 2014 financial year. What is most notable is that we continue to deliver strong headline earnings growth notwithstanding a still very uncertain, and to some extent, volatile macroeconomic backdrop. I'll then update you on the progress we are making with our business performance enhancement program. Paul will then go into more detail on our financial and operational performance. I'll then come back on to talk to you about the advancements we've been making on our key capital projects before opening it up for any questions you may have. \r\nMoving on to Slide 5. The true measure of our success is our ability to create value for our shareholders, and in turn, our stakeholders. If we look at the graph, you see there in front of you over the past 20 months, from July 2, 2012, to March 7 of this year, Sasol share price increased by 71% from ZAR 340 to ZAR 582. We acknowledge that given our business model, we are impacted by the move in crude oil prices, the rand-dollar exchange rate and country- and continent-specific factors. \r\nTo some extent, these factors influence the result of companies worldwide and are not unique to Sasol. It should also be borne in mind that macroeconomic factors do not only positively impact an organization's results. In analyzing our company's performance over the last 20 months, the weaker rand and a slight improvement in chemical product prices support our earnings growth. While on the flip side, crude oil prices had a slightly negative impact. In addition, and particularly within our South African environment, the above-inflation growth in labor and maintenance costs and ongoing electricity price hikes also adversely impacted our numbers. In calculating the effects on our share price performance, we've taken both the positive and negative into account as illustrated by the second bar on the graph. In instances where macroeconomics support a company's value proposition, management can easily become complacent. However, being a consistently successful business is all about leveraging the positives and limiting the negatives, whatever the microeconomics. At Sasol, being complacent is not an option. The lighter blue bars to the right of the graph, highlight the role played by decisive leadership in managing the factors under our control, including optimizing volumes, enhancing organizational structures and systems, executing on our capital projects and continually driving our business performance. \r\nLooking at it differently, if we consider the contribution of these controllable factors on our performance, from July 2012 to the end of December 2013, we added an additional ZAR 3.7 billion to our operating profit. This equates to an increase in our headline earnings per share of 10% on top of a previous record earnings base. The value created here is due to the contributions made across the group, most notably through an improved operational performance over the period. \r\nGoing forward, and as depicted on the right-hand side of the graph, we see even more upside as we secure additional business performance improvements and execute on our growth program. Here, our U.S. cracker, along with its derivative units, is first up. In addition, we are confident that our growth ambitions will continue to be underscored by our progressive dividend policy. You saw this again today with our announcement of record interim dividends. \r\nLooking at Slide 6. Record financial results aside, we fully recognize the direct link between top-class business performance and a higher purpose. As the slide is self-explanatory, I will not talk to the specifics you see listed here. \r\nLet's instead move onto Slide 7, which highlights our key milestones for the first half of the 2014 financial year. Safety remains our #1 priority and is a strategic imperative for our sustainable operation. We have over the last 2 years seen marked improvement and ended our half year with a recordable case rate excluding illnesses of 0.3. Over the period, our star safety performance was the ORYX GTL joint venture in Qatar. By the end of February, the facility completed over 11 million exposure hours, equating to 919 days without a recordable incident. In addition, the plant had over 17 million hours work without a lost time injury, here totaling 1,528 days. This is a remarkable achievement in the industry. \r\nTurning next to our operational performance. In September, our Synfuels team successfully completed the facility's largest-ever shut down with more than 155 activities executed, utilizing an additional 36,000 people on site daily. In turn, our flagship GTL joint venture ORYX set a further noteworthy production record. Over the period, the plant recorded an average utilization rate of 94% as it benefited from a shutdown early last year. \r\nAs part of delivering and growing sustainably, this past half year, we advanced a number of key projects and initiatives. Last month, we were granted an extension of our Secunda mining rights to 2040. This approval was critical, not only for our mining operations but more importantly, it will go a long way to ensuring an uninterrupted supply of liquid fuels and chemicals for several decades to come in South Africa. \r\nIn January, and with the support of our keynote speaker, Minister Rob Davies, from the Department of Trade and Industry, we successfully inaugurated our ethylene purification unit in Sasolburg. The project was completed on time and within its approved budget, and will increase ethylene volumes for our polyethylene plants by 47,000 tons annually. These volumes are a key input for the local plastics industry. \r\nTurning to our ongoing technological advancements. At the end of last year, we were proud to launch our Sasol turbodiesel 10 part per million product. This is the lowest-sulfur-content diesel offered on the African continent, moving South Africa closer to international clean fuel specifications. \r\nTurning to Slide 8. In terms of our overall half year FY '14 results, Sasol maintained a strong operational performance across the value chain. Here, it was encouraging to see the chemicals businesses contributing significantly to the group. Also noteworthy was Sasol Synfuels' ability to deliver sustainable volumes, notwithstanding its largest shutdown ever. Having achieved 3.7 million tons over the period, normalized production volumes at Synfuels were up by 3%. \r\nAs we incur costs to ensure plant stability and the weaker rand continues to exert pressure on our South African businesses, we were pleased to maintain our normalized cash fixed costs below South African PPI of 6.4%. Excluding once-off, operating profit was up 33%. Headline earnings per share off a record base was up by 26% to ZAR 30.19. Cash generated from operations was up 50% to ZAR 28.1 billion. As a result of the group's strong performance, an interim dividend of ZAR 8 per share was declared. This was a record interim dividend, up by 40% and well in line with our progressive dividend policy. \r\nMoving on to Slide 10, and before I hand over to Paul, let me provide you with a quick update on our business performance enhancement program. Since launching the program in 2013, we've made significant progress in rightsizing and repositioning Sasol. Having finalized the design of our new groupwide operating model, including the top management structures, we are on track to implement our new platform on July 1. By the end of June, we will have reorganized the majority of our senior management structures and refined our financial reporting processes. This reorganization will significantly reduce the company's top management decision making layers. \r\nBy way of example, we have reduced the number of group executives subcommittees from 57 to 9, an 84% reduction. In addition, we have reduced the total number of meetings within our governance structure from 580 per year to 160, a 72% reduction. The management team intends on using this extra time wisely, focusing more specifically on enhancing the productivity over existing operations and on driving our strategic growth ambitions. Together with the implementation of our new management structures and related corporate governance framework, we are introducing key system and process changes. The new operating model will also result in simplified and fit-for-purpose functional support to the business. \r\nThe first tranche of bankable savings has been driven by optimizing our external spend. Our FY '14 savings are trending above ZAR 200 million. The overall program charges are in the region of ZAR 1.2 billion for this financial year. This includes project costs, charges associated with the reconfiguration of our ERP systems and restructuring expenses. \r\nLast year, we confirmed that we expected to generate annual savings of at least ZAR 3 billion. Based on our current analysis, we are confident that we will exceed this target with 30% to 40% of the savings realized by the end of FY '15. The full benefit of our management interventions will be evident from FY '16 onward, where after cash fixed cost trends are expected to follow inflation. Let me now hand it over to Paul, who will unpack our results in more detail. Paul?\n\n---\n\nThanks, David. Good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'm delighted to present the 2014 financial interim overview to you today. The group has delivered another set of record results well within the guided earnings range previously announced to the market. \r\nBefore I move into more details on the result, I would like to make a couple of introductory remarks. First, management's continued focus on factors within its control has resulted in a strong overall business performance with overall improved volumes ahead of internal production targets. We have also contained the increase in normalized cash fixed costs to within inflation, despite a very challenging South African cost environment. We continue to demonstrate our commitment to our progressive dividend policy to a record 40% increase in our interim dividend. And finally, our strong balance sheet remains resilient on the back of strong cash flow generation, which continues to position Sasol quite well to fund our objective growth projects, deliver on our progressive dividend policy, as well as provide a sufficient buffer for volatility. \r\nMoving onto Slide 11. The macroeconomic environment remains volatile and uncertain. The average rand/U.S. dollar exchange rate was 19% weaker compared to the comparable period with a relatively flat average rate crude oil price, improved chemical process and a strong increase in Henry Hub prices. The Sasol business remains sensitive to significant movements in the oil price and the rand/U.S. dollar exchange rate and we remind you of our sensitivity to each of these variables, which we issue with a health warning in uncertain markets. We estimate that a ZAR 0.10 change in the annual average rand/U.S. dollar exchange rate and a $1 dollar change in the crude oil price will affect our profits from global operation by approximately ZAR 936 million and ZAR 702 million, respectively. \r\nMoving on to Slide 12. Before I move into details of the results, I would like to highlight that with the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standard, changes are made in how certain of our investments are accounted for in our financial results. All prior year numbers have been restated accordingly. For further details, I refer you to our full results announcement. \r\nOverall, we delivered a strong group operational performance with increased sales volumes, supported by a weaker rand/dollar exchange rate and improved chemical prices. This translated into a 26% increase in headline earnings per share to a record ZAR 30.19 per share. \r\nThe first half operating profit was significantly impacted by once-off items of ZAR 5.7 billion, relating primarily to the ZAR 5.3 billion impairment of our Canadian shale gas assets. Excluding the impact of once-off items, the increase in operating profit would have been enhanced to 33% and the operating margin would've been 6% higher at about 26%. Our South African energy businesses delivered a strong performance, expanding operating margin by more than 2% compared to the comparable period, mainly as a result of high production volumes, tight cost management, as well as favorable rand product prices. ORYX GTL also delivered another excellent operational performance in our international energy cluster with production performance exceeding our own expectations. Our chemical businesses have delivered improved volume and benefited from chemical prices. \r\nMoving on to Slide 13. As previously mentioned by David, our current normalized cash fixed cost inflation is within South African PPI inflation trends of 6.4% for the first half of the 2014 financial year. This is despite a challenging South African cost environment driven by high labor, maintenance and electricity costs. Although, overall we benefited from a weaker rand/dollar exchange rate, the impact of a weaker rand added a further 4.9% to our total cash fixed costs. Growth and study costs added a further 0.4%, while the implementation costs of our business enhancement program amounted to a further 0.4% or ZAR 190 million. \r\nLabor, maintenance and energy remain the main drivers of our cost base, with labor comprising approximately 55% of our total cash fixed costs. Labor costs per head for the year are expected to increase ahead of our a PPI inflation. Energy cost inflation in South Africa is likely be just over 7% for the 2014 financial year based on the Eskom increase announced by NERSA. Our strategy to contain energy costs has seen us successfully ramp up our electricity generation capacity in South Africa to approximately 70% of our own requirement. Our investment in plant maintenance over the past couple of years has successfully delivered plant stability and improved volumes across our key businesses. And lastly, strides taken in our business performance enhancement program also contributed to this positive stream in cost trends.\r\nMoving to Slide 14. Operating profit was supported by a mostly favorable macroeconomic environment during the first half of the 2014 financial year. The weaker rand-dollar exchange rate was the largest contributor to the increase in operating profit, boosting operating profit by 37%, improved product prices added a further 7%. It is extremely encouraging to note the positive impact of increased sales volume of 7% across the group. This is on the back of a 7% increase in sales volumes for the 2013 financial year. The total increase over the last 18 months amounted to ZAR 3.7 billion in real terms on a record 2012 earnings base. However, operating profit was negatively impacted by once-off items of ZAR 5.7 billion, as well as year-end adjustments such as the provision for share-based payment expenses and higher depreciation charges relating to our Canadian shale gas asset, shut downs and statutory maintenance, as well as new plants. \r\nMoving to Slide 15. The SA Energy cluster continues to underpin the group's profit and cash flow generation with a 28% increase in operating profit. Sasol Mining's operating profit increased by 4% despite higher operating costs. Profits were supported by higher sales prices to Sasol Synfuels and weaker rand. Sasol Gas 34% increase in operating profit includes a gain of ZAR 453 million on the disposal of our investment in Spring Lights Gas. Excluding remeasurement items, operating profit increased by 11%, supported by a 5% increase in sales volumes and marginally improved sales prices. \r\nSasol Synfuels remains the largest contributor to the SA Energy cluster's operating profit. Operating profit increased by 30% and operating margin expanded by an impressive 6.4% to 51%, the highest level since 2009. Profits were driven largely by a weaker rand, as well as better-than-expected production volumes despite the largest shutdown in Sasol Synfuel's history. Management's ongoing efforts to contain costs, coupled with improved plant stability resulted in cash unit costs increasing by 6.9% in line with inflation. \r\nSasol Oil's operating profit increased by 22%, benefiting from improved refining and sales margins. Sasol Oil's cash fixed costs were also contained to within inflation. Production volumes were 12% higher, largely due to the postponement of a planned shutdown at Natref to the second half of the calendar -- of the financial year. \r\nMoving to Slide 16. Focusing on our international energy cluster. Sasol Synfuels International's operating loss decreased by 4%. Growth and study costs, previously expensed, declined significantly with the U.S. GTL project moving into FEED. This benefit was partially negated by once-off items incurred by the SSI business. \r\nORYX GTL recorded a 10% increase in operating profit, driven by the increase in volumes and a weaker rand. The facility achieved a year-to-date average utilization rate of 94%, which is 4% higher than our previous guided range. ORYX GTL is the flagship for our GTL technology and its continued strong performance reinforces our GTL value proposition. Sasol Petroleum International recorded a disappointing operating loss of ZAR 6.1 billion for the period. \r\nIn Africa, Mozambique and Gabon performed well, delivering 6% higher volumes, and we are making good progress with our growth programs in Mozambique, which David will provide more color on. Although Gabon's oil production is slowly declining, we are maturing additional volumes to sustain the life of the asset. Our Canadian upstream asset generated operating loss of ZAR 6.5 million impacted by ZAR 5.3 billion impairment, coupled with the depreciation charge of ZAR 1.3 billion. Although the asset remains under pressure in the short term due to low North American gas prices and high depreciation, cash flow generated from this operation still remains positive. We continue to execute our approved production program in conjunction with our now new JV partner, Progress Energy, and we'll be able to ramp up activities once we see an increase in the gas prices. \r\nMoving to Slide 17. In November, Talisman announced that it reached agreement to sell its 50% share in the Montney shale gas asset to Progress Energy. As previously indicated, Sasol took a decision not to exercise its right of first refusal in respect of this asset. Talisman's disposal, coupled with a further decline in the conditions in the North American gas market, prompted us to take an impairment review of our 50% share in the Montney asset. As a result of our evaluation, we impaired our Canadian shale gas asset by approximately CAD 550 million or ZAR 5.3 billion to a carrying value of CAD 1.1 -- apologies, CAD 1.1 billion. \r\nIn our impairment review, we have used a more conservative gas price outlook compared to what we use in evaluating our potential GTL and chemical investment opportunities. I want to reemphasize that despite this impairment, we believe that our Canadian shale gas assets continue to provide a strategic hedge for our GTL plans. \r\nMoving to Slide 18. We have seen an overall recovery in sales prices and volumes in our chemical businesses. The focused business turnaround plan in our South African Polymer business has yielded positive results. Polymers reduced its operating loss to ZAR 351 million from ZAR 1.1 billion in the comparative period. This is mainly attributable to a 7% higher production volume increase and improved margin. The EPU5 plant commissioned in October 2013 has brought significant stability and financial benefit to our C2 value chain. The C3 stabilization plant, which is expected to come on stream middle of the calendar year 2014 is expected to further improve feedstock availability to the local business. \r\nOur international Polymer business contributed a profit of ZAR 194 million. This excludes a final loss on disposal of ZAR 198 million for our Arya Sasol Polymers company in Iran. Effective 16 August 2013, Sasol no longer has any investments in Iran. \r\nSolvents delivered a strong operational result despite a challenging economical climate. Improved sales volume, tight cost control and a weaker rand supported the increase in operating profit to ZAR 358 million. In December 2013, we signed an agreement to dispose most of our Solvents Germany asset. This resulted in the impairment of ZAR 466 million. The disposal is still subject to the approval of the European antitrust authorities. Once approved, it's expected that the loss on disposal will be recorded in the second half of the current financial year. \r\nO&S remains the largest contributor to the chemical cluster's operating profit and the second largest contributor to the group's operating profit. Operating profit increased by 75% to ZAR 2.7 billion or an increase of 40% in euro terms. Operating margins expanded almost 2% to 10.4%. Our U.S. business continues to benefit from improved margins on low U.S. ethane prices coupled with high production and sales volumes. \r\nFocusing on operating profit in other chemical businesses. Wax increased its operating profit by 24% on the back of higher volumes, favorable prices and a weaker rand. Overall, the operating profit of this segment decreased by 34% on the back of the challenging market conditions in our fertilizer and ammonia businesses. \r\nMoving on to Slide 19. Our continued focus -- our continued strong cash flow generation from our foundation businesses is evident from a 50% increase in cash generated by our operations amounting to ZAR 28.1 billion. This, together with our deleveraged balance sheet, which reflects our ungeared position of 0.8% at half year, positions us uniquely to fund the steady advancements of our attractive growth projects and deliver on our progressive dividend policy. We have spent ZAR 20 billion of capital investment in the current financial year to date, in line with our expectation of which approximately 54% was in South Africa. We have maintained our capitalization estimate for 2014 of ZAR 42 billion and ZAR 50 billion for 2015. Approximately half of these capital investments over the next 2 years will be spent in South Africa. A large portion of our future growth capital investment will be allocated to our mega growth projects, which is in line with our growth strategy. \r\nTurning on to Slide 20. Taking into account our record headline earnings per share, the ongoing strength of our financial position, the current capital investment plan and our progressive dividend policy, we have increased the interim dividend by 40% to a record ZAR 8 per share. Our dividend yield of approximately 4% and our total shareholder return of 122% in rand terms over the past 5 years continues to position Sasol competitively with our peer group, reinforcing our commitment to consistently return value to our shareholders. Despite our recent strong share price performance, we remain confident in our ability to return further value to our shareholders through sweating our existing current asset base, executing on our growth projects, achieving our business performance enhancement program target, as well as delivering on our progressive dividend policy. \r\nMoving on to Slide 21. We expect macroeconomic conditions to remain volatile. In the near term, we anticipate stable oil prices, slightly improved U.S. natural gas prices, a progressive recovery in chemical product prices and flat refining margins. We assume a slight strengthening in the rand/dollar exchange rate from its current level. We expect an overall solid production performance for 2014 financial year. \r\nSasol Synfuel's volume guidance remains unchanged to be between 7.3 million and 7.5 million tons, international ORYX GTL to maintain full year utilization rate of above 90%, and in Canada, we anticipate marginally decreased production due to reduced drilling activities and fewer new wells coming on stream. We expect normalized cash fixed costs to increase slightly above South African PPI as we incur costs to ensure plant stability. \r\nIn a recent budget speech, the Minister of Finance announced that the implementation of carbon tax would be postponed by a year to 2016. We continue to engage with government on the draft carbon tax legislation. Until we obtain further clarity, we are unable to provide guidance on the impact of carbon tax on our group profit. And lastly, we expect a significant improvement in Polymer's profitability below our previous guidance range for the 2014 financial year. \r\nMoving on to Slide 22. I would like to explain what David touched on earlier in respect of our business performance enhancement program. If you look at the graph, it provides a summary of our cost savings utilization timeline, including the program. As David stated and based on our future analysis, we expect to generate sustainable annual savings of more than ZAR 3 billion from financial year '16. Up to 40% of these savings will be achieved by the end of our 2015 financial year with the balance realized by the following financial year, 2016. We will communicate any potential upside to these savings once we have embedded our new operating model and affected the related structural and process changes. We expect implementation costs for the 2014 financial year to be approximately ZAR 1.2 billion. This will increase somewhat in FY '15 when the program reaches its peak and will taper off in financial year '16 as we finalize the implementation. We expect that costs will follow PPI trends from financial year '16. \r\nIn conclusion, management's continued focus on factors within its control has resulted in a strong overall business performance in a challenging environment and delivered record first half profitability. On that note, I'll hand back to David.\n\n---\n\nThanks very much, Paul. I just got a couple of slides to go through before we get to questions. \r\nLooking at Slide 24. The focus here is on our key capital project milestones. We continue to progress the front-end engineering and design of our U.S. growth program, which includes our world-scale ethane cracker complex and a GTL facility in Louisiana. It's anticipated that we'll reach the final investment decision for the cracker project within this calendar year, with FID for the U.S. GTL plant to follow 18 to 24 months thereafter. \r\nTurning to Uzbekistan GTL, we're in an extended FEED phase on the project. The majority of the technical FEED activities have been completed. The FID for this project is dependent upon securing project funding and signing up a new partner to take up 19% of our current stake in the venture. We anticipate reaching financial close during the second half of the 2014 calendar year. \r\nIn Nigeria, the Escravos GTL project is in start-up. Beneficial operation for the first train is expected before the end of June. In South Africa, our ZAR 1.3 billion C3 stabilization project in Secunda remains on track and is expected to be in operation by the middle of this calendar year. \r\nIn Louisiana, we've successfully commissioned our first-of-a-kind 100,000-ton per year ethylene tetramerisation unit for the production of co-monomers. We expect the plant to be fully operational by the end of this financial year. \r\nLooking at our drive to develop further low-carbon power opportunities, we are completing the development of a 140-megawatt gas-fired power plant at Ressano Garcia in Mozambique in partnership with the country's state-owned utility company. Beneficial operation remains on track for the middle of this calendar year. \r\nNow before I close, I'd like to provide you with an update on our upstream projects in the Southern Africa. Over the past 10 years, we've developed the Temane and Pande stranded gas fields in Mozambique through strong in-country partnerships and our technical expertise. Over this period, together with our partners, we've committed approximately $3 billion in capital investment, which includes the development and expansion of our Central Processing Facility and natural gas fields in Southern Mozambique, the construction of the Mozambique/Secunda pipeline and the gas-to-power project in Ressano Garcia I just mentioned. \r\nLooking at our future investments, in November, we declared a notice of commercial discovery of hydrocarbon reservoirs in the Production Sharing Agreement, or PSA, license area. Here, we are on track to submit a field development plan to Mozambican authorities in February 2015. We are also investigating the upside potential of additional resources in the current producing license, the Petroleum Production Agreement, and completed a 2D seismic campaign in onshore license Area A. In addition, we have formulated a portfolio of downstream gas commercialization options to match our resource estimates. We believe that the gas discoveries in the north of Mozambique are large enough to support significant additional gas monetization options outside of LNG. These options include power generation, chemicals and piped gas, which are all aligned with the government drivers specified in the draft Mozambique Gas Master Plan. \r\nNext, looking at our upstream activities closer to home, we recently converted an offshore technical cooperation permit to an exploration right for the Durban and Zululand Basins. And exploration right has an area of 82,117 square kilometers in water depths ranging from 50 to 3,200 meters. This is a 100% Sasol venture and was approved in August 2013 by the Department of Mineral Resources. \r\nSo from this slide, you can see that we have an extremely busy period ahead of us. \r\nTo the final slide. Slide 25 highlights why we believe Sasol remains a compelling investment proposition. This slide summarizes what Paul and I have already covered this afternoon, so I won't run you through the pillars. Suffice it to say that much as FY '13 was all about prioritizing the important and the urgent, FY '14 is all about setting the stage for our future success. We've done our homework, and we are now repositioning Sasol. \r\nWith that, I'll turn it back to the operator for any questions that you may have. Thanks.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nThank you, operator. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the conference call today. Joining me from Sasol here in Johannesburg are Paul Victor, our acting CFO; Bernard Klingenberg, Group Executive for South African Energy; Riaan Rademan, our Group Executive for Mining and Business Enablement and Ernst Oberholster, Group Executive for International Energy Technology and New Business Development. Also dialing in from our North American head office in Houston is Steve Cornell, Executive Vice President for International Operation; and connecting from our Hamburg office in Germany, Fleetwodd Grobler, Group Executive for Global Chemicals. \r\nToday, we announced another excellent groupwide performance. To contextualize the half year and before we run through the presentation you have in front of you, let me start by reflecting on the recent past. As a company, we've come a long way in the last 2.5 years. Looking back for us at Sasol, FY '12 was all about goal setting and consolidation. During that time, we carefully assessed our areas of competitive advantage and where we could do better. We drove operational improvement and focused on safe, stable and reliable operations. We refined our strategic agenda and narrowed in on 2 broad regional strategies: first, our-nurture-and-grow strategy, primarily here in Southern Africa, where we seek to enhance our strong position in the region; and secondly, our expand-and-deliver strategy, which is underpinned by our North American aspirations and specifically our U.S. growth program. \r\nAt our results announcement in September last year, I told you that our 2013 financial year would be a watershed for Sasol. After all, in FY '13, we consciously moved away from coal to liquids growth and stepped up our gas-to-liquids ambitions. At the same time, we accelerated our low-carbon power generation initiatives and drove safe and more efficient operations. Now as part of this step change, we reprioritized our project pipeline to deliver tangible and sustainable value and crucially, we focused the entire company on a single set of priorities, which included the urgent need to address our cost creep. To ensure that we are a more effective organization, the management team signed off on a redesigned operating model, with simplified structures, streamlined decision-making layers and fit-for-purpose functions. \r\nNow turning to FY '14, from July last year to date, we have been laying a solid foundation across the organization for what will be a new era in Sasol's history. The hard work of the past several years is already paying off. Although in management's view, this is only the beginning. The full benefits of the new Sasol will only be realized from our 2015 financial year onward. The strong results we announced today are a testament to our ability to leverage our unique value proposition, optimizing the macroeconomic impact while managing the factors within our control. \r\nHere, through deliberate interventions, we are increasing volumes, driving business performance enhancements and moving forward on our strategic growth projects. \r\nTurning to Slide 4. Let me start with an overview of what you'll hear today. I'll begin by providing you with a snapshot of how we are creating long-term shareholder value. Next, under the heading of delivery and growth, I'll highlight the key milestones we achieved during the first half of the 2014 financial year. What is most notable is that we continue to deliver strong headline earnings growth notwithstanding a still very uncertain, and to some extent, volatile macroeconomic backdrop. I'll then update you on the progress we are making with our business performance enhancement program. Paul will then go into more detail on our financial and operational performance. I'll then come back on to talk to you about the advancements we've been making on our key capital projects before opening it up for any questions you may have. \r\nMoving on to Slide 5. The true measure of our success is our ability to create value for our shareholders, and in turn, our stakeholders. If we look at the graph, you see there in front of you over the past 20 months, from July 2, 2012, to March 7 of this year, Sasol share price increased by 71% from ZAR 340 to ZAR 582. We acknowledge that given our business model, we are impacted by the move in crude oil prices, the rand-dollar exchange rate and country- and continent-specific factors. \r\nTo some extent, these factors influence the result of companies worldwide and are not unique to Sasol. It should also be borne in mind that macroeconomic factors do not only positively impact an organization's results. In analyzing our company's performance over the last 20 months, the weaker rand and a slight improvement in chemical product prices support our earnings growth. While on the flip side, crude oil prices had a slightly negative impact. In addition, and particularly within our South African environment, the above-inflation growth in labor and maintenance costs and ongoing electricity price hikes also adversely impacted our numbers. In calculating the effects on our share price performance, we've taken both the positive and negative into account as illustrated by the second bar on the graph. In instances where macroeconomics support a company's value proposition, management can easily become complacent. However, being a consistently successful business is all about leveraging the positives and limiting the negatives, whatever the microeconomics. At Sasol, being complacent is not an option. The lighter blue bars to the right of the graph, highlight the role played by decisive leadership in managing the factors under our control, including optimizing volumes, enhancing organizational structures and systems, executing on our capital projects and continually driving our business performance. \r\nLooking at it differently, if we consider the contribution of these controllable factors on our performance, from July 2012 to the end of December 2013, we added an additional ZAR 3.7 billion to our operating profit. This equates to an increase in our headline earnings per share of 10% on top of a previous record earnings base. The value created here is due to the contributions made across the group, most notably through an improved operational performance over the period. \r\nGoing forward, and as depicted on the right-hand side of the graph, we see even more upside as we secure additional business performance improvements and execute on our growth program. Here, our U.S. cracker, along with its derivative units, is first up. In addition, we are confident that our growth ambitions will continue to be underscored by our progressive dividend policy. You saw this again today with our announcement of record interim dividends. \r\nLooking at Slide 6. Record financial results aside, we fully recognize the direct link between top-class business performance and a higher purpose. As the slide is self-explanatory, I will not talk to the specifics you see listed here. \r\nLet's instead move onto Slide 7, which highlights our key milestones for the first half of the 2014 financial year. Safety remains our #1 priority and is a strategic imperative for our sustainable operation. We have over the last 2 years seen marked improvement and ended our half year with a recordable case rate excluding illnesses of 0.3. Over the period, our star safety performance was the ORYX GTL joint venture in Qatar. By the end of February, the facility completed over 11 million exposure hours, equating to 919 days without a recordable incident. In addition, the plant had over 17 million hours work without a lost time injury, here totaling 1,528 days. This is a remarkable achievement in the industry. \r\nTurning next to our operational performance. In September, our Synfuels team successfully completed the facility's largest-ever shut down with more than 155 activities executed, utilizing an additional 36,000 people on site daily. In turn, our flagship GTL joint venture ORYX set a further noteworthy production record. Over the period, the plant recorded an average utilization rate of 94% as it benefited from a shutdown early last year. \r\nAs part of delivering and growing sustainably, this past half year, we advanced a number of key projects and initiatives. Last month, we were granted an extension of our Secunda mining rights to 2040. This approval was critical, not only for our mining operations but more importantly, it will go a long way to ensuring an uninterrupted supply of liquid fuels and chemicals for several decades to come in South Africa. \r\nIn January, and with the support of our keynote speaker, Minister Rob Davies, from the Department of Trade and Industry, we successfully inaugurated our ethylene purification unit in Sasolburg. The project was completed on time and within its approved budget, and will increase ethylene volumes for our polyethylene plants by 47,000 tons annually. These volumes are a key input for the local plastics industry. \r\nTurning to our ongoing technological advancements. At the end of last year, we were proud to launch our Sasol turbodiesel 10 part per million product. This is the lowest-sulfur-content diesel offered on the African continent, moving South Africa closer to international clean fuel specifications. \r\nTurning to Slide 8. In terms of our overall half year FY '14 results, Sasol maintained a strong operational performance across the value chain. Here, it was encouraging to see the chemicals businesses contributing significantly to the group. Also noteworthy was Sasol Synfuels' ability to deliver sustainable volumes, notwithstanding its largest shutdown ever. Having achieved 3.7 million tons over the period, normalized production volumes at Synfuels were up by 3%. \r\nAs we incur costs to ensure plant stability and the weaker rand continues to exert pressure on our South African businesses, we were pleased to maintain our normalized cash fixed costs below South African PPI of 6.4%. Excluding once-off, operating profit was up 33%. Headline earnings per share off a record base was up by 26% to ZAR 30.19. Cash generated from operations was up 50% to ZAR 28.1 billion. As a result of the group's strong performance, an interim dividend of ZAR 8 per share was declared. This was a record interim dividend, up by 40% and well in line with our progressive dividend policy. \r\nMoving on to Slide 10, and before I hand over to Paul, let me provide you with a quick update on our business performance enhancement program. Since launching the program in 2013, we've made significant progress in rightsizing and repositioning Sasol. Having finalized the design of our new groupwide operating model, including the top management structures, we are on track to implement our new platform on July 1. By the end of June, we will have reorganized the majority of our senior management structures and refined our financial reporting processes. This reorganization will significantly reduce the company's top management decision making layers. \r\nBy way of example, we have reduced the number of group executives subcommittees from 57 to 9, an 84% reduction. In addition, we have reduced the total number of meetings within our governance structure from 580 per year to 160, a 72% reduction. The management team intends on using this extra time wisely, focusing more specifically on enhancing the productivity over existing operations and on driving our strategic growth ambitions. Together with the implementation of our new management structures and related corporate governance framework, we are introducing key system and process changes. The new operating model will also result in simplified and fit-for-purpose functional support to the business. \r\nThe first tranche of bankable savings has been driven by optimizing our external spend. Our FY '14 savings are trending above ZAR 200 million. The overall program charges are in the region of ZAR 1.2 billion for this financial year. This includes project costs, charges associated with the reconfiguration of our ERP systems and restructuring expenses. \r\nLast year, we confirmed that we expected to generate annual savings of at least ZAR 3 billion. Based on our current analysis, we are confident that we will exceed this target with 30% to 40% of the savings realized by the end of FY '15. The full benefit of our management interventions will be evident from FY '16 onward, where after cash fixed cost trends are expected to follow inflation. Let me now hand it over to Paul, who will unpack our results in more detail. Paul?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Paul Victor (Executives)】\nThanks, David. Good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'm delighted to present the 2014 financial interim overview to you today. The group has delivered another set of record results well within the guided earnings range previously announced to the market. \r\nBefore I move into more details on the result, I would like to make a couple of introductory remarks. First, management's continued focus on factors within its control has resulted in a strong overall business performance with overall improved volumes ahead of internal production targets. We have also contained the increase in normalized cash fixed costs to within inflation, despite a very challenging South African cost environment. We continue to demonstrate our commitment to our progressive dividend policy to a record 40% increase in our interim dividend. And finally, our strong balance sheet remains resilient on the back of strong cash flow generation, which continues to position Sasol quite well to fund our objective growth projects, deliver on our progressive dividend policy, as well as provide a sufficient buffer for volatility. \r\nMoving onto Slide 11. The macroeconomic environment remains volatile and uncertain. The average rand/U.S. dollar exchange rate was 19% weaker compared to the comparable period with a relatively flat average rate crude oil price, improved chemical process and a strong increase in Henry Hub prices. The Sasol business remains sensitive to significant movements in the oil price and the rand/U.S. dollar exchange rate and we remind you of our sensitivity to each of these variables, which we issue with a health warning in uncertain markets. We estimate that a ZAR 0.10 change in the annual average rand/U.S. dollar exchange rate and a $1 dollar change in the crude oil price will affect our profits from global operation by approximately ZAR 936 million and ZAR 702 million, respectively. \r\nMoving on to Slide 12. Before I move into details of the results, I would like to highlight that with the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standard, changes are made in how certain of our investments are accounted for in our financial results. All prior year numbers have been restated accordingly. For further details, I refer you to our full results announcement. \r\nOverall, we delivered a strong group operational performance with increased sales volumes, supported by a weaker rand/dollar exchange rate and improved chemical prices. This translated into a 26% increase in headline earnings per share to a record ZAR 30.19 per share. \r\nThe first half operating profit was significantly impacted by once-off items of ZAR 5.7 billion, relating primarily to the ZAR 5.3 billion impairment of our Canadian shale gas assets. Excluding the impact of once-off items, the increase in operating profit would have been enhanced to 33% and the operating margin would've been 6% higher at about 26%. Our South African energy businesses delivered a strong performance, expanding operating margin by more than 2% compared to the comparable period, mainly as a result of high production volumes, tight cost management, as well as favorable rand product prices. ORYX GTL also delivered another excellent operational performance in our international energy cluster with production performance exceeding our own expectations. Our chemical businesses have delivered improved volume and benefited from chemical prices. \r\nMoving on to Slide 13. As previously mentioned by David, our current normalized cash fixed cost inflation is within South African PPI inflation trends of 6.4% for the first half of the 2014 financial year. This is despite a challenging South African cost environment driven by high labor, maintenance and electricity costs. Although, overall we benefited from a weaker rand/dollar exchange rate, the impact of a weaker rand added a further 4.9% to our total cash fixed costs. Growth and study costs added a further 0.4%, while the implementation costs of our business enhancement program amounted to a further 0.4% or ZAR 190 million. \r\nLabor, maintenance and energy remain the main drivers of our cost base, with labor comprising approximately 55% of our total cash fixed costs. Labor costs per head for the year are expected to increase ahead of our a PPI inflation. Energy cost inflation in South Africa is likely be just over 7% for the 2014 financial year based on the Eskom increase announced by NERSA. Our strategy to contain energy costs has seen us successfully ramp up our electricity generation capacity in South Africa to approximately 70% of our own requirement. Our investment in plant maintenance over the past couple of years has successfully delivered plant stability and improved volumes across our key businesses. And lastly, strides taken in our business performance enhancement program also contributed to this positive stream in cost trends.\r\nMoving to Slide 14. Operating profit was supported by a mostly favorable macroeconomic environment during the first half of the 2014 financial year. The weaker rand-dollar exchange rate was the largest contributor to the increase in operating profit, boosting operating profit by 37%, improved product prices added a further 7%. It is extremely encouraging to note the positive impact of increased sales volume of 7% across the group. This is on the back of a 7% increase in sales volumes for the 2013 financial year. The total increase over the last 18 months amounted to ZAR 3.7 billion in real terms on a record 2012 earnings base. However, operating profit was negatively impacted by once-off items of ZAR 5.7 billion, as well as year-end adjustments such as the provision for share-based payment expenses and higher depreciation charges relating to our Canadian shale gas asset, shut downs and statutory maintenance, as well as new plants. \r\nMoving to Slide 15. The SA Energy cluster continues to underpin the group's profit and cash flow generation with a 28% increase in operating profit. Sasol Mining's operating profit increased by 4% despite higher operating costs. Profits were supported by higher sales prices to Sasol Synfuels and weaker rand. Sasol Gas 34% increase in operating profit includes a gain of ZAR 453 million on the disposal of our investment in Spring Lights Gas. Excluding remeasurement items, operating profit increased by 11%, supported by a 5% increase in sales volumes and marginally improved sales prices. \r\nSasol Synfuels remains the largest contributor to the SA Energy cluster's operating profit. Operating profit increased by 30% and operating margin expanded by an impressive 6.4% to 51%, the highest level since 2009. Profits were driven largely by a weaker rand, as well as better-than-expected production volumes despite the largest shutdown in Sasol Synfuel's history. Management's ongoing efforts to contain costs, coupled with improved plant stability resulted in cash unit costs increasing by 6.9% in line with inflation. \r\nSasol Oil's operating profit increased by 22%, benefiting from improved refining and sales margins. Sasol Oil's cash fixed costs were also contained to within inflation. Production volumes were 12% higher, largely due to the postponement of a planned shutdown at Natref to the second half of the calendar -- of the financial year. \r\nMoving to Slide 16. Focusing on our international energy cluster. Sasol Synfuels International's operating loss decreased by 4%. Growth and study costs, previously expensed, declined significantly with the U.S. GTL project moving into FEED. This benefit was partially negated by once-off items incurred by the SSI business. \r\nORYX GTL recorded a 10% increase in operating profit, driven by the increase in volumes and a weaker rand. The facility achieved a year-to-date average utilization rate of 94%, which is 4% higher than our previous guided range. ORYX GTL is the flagship for our GTL technology and its continued strong performance reinforces our GTL value proposition. Sasol Petroleum International recorded a disappointing operating loss of ZAR 6.1 billion for the period. \r\nIn Africa, Mozambique and Gabon performed well, delivering 6% higher volumes, and we are making good progress with our growth programs in Mozambique, which David will provide more color on. Although Gabon's oil production is slowly declining, we are maturing additional volumes to sustain the life of the asset. Our Canadian upstream asset generated operating loss of ZAR 6.5 million impacted by ZAR 5.3 billion impairment, coupled with the depreciation charge of ZAR 1.3 billion. Although the asset remains under pressure in the short term due to low North American gas prices and high depreciation, cash flow generated from this operation still remains positive. We continue to execute our approved production program in conjunction with our now new JV partner, Progress Energy, and we'll be able to ramp up activities once we see an increase in the gas prices. \r\nMoving to Slide 17. In November, Talisman announced that it reached agreement to sell its 50% share in the Montney shale gas asset to Progress Energy. As previously indicated, Sasol took a decision not to exercise its right of first refusal in respect of this asset. Talisman's disposal, coupled with a further decline in the conditions in the North American gas market, prompted us to take an impairment review of our 50% share in the Montney asset. As a result of our evaluation, we impaired our Canadian shale gas asset by approximately CAD 550 million or ZAR 5.3 billion to a carrying value of CAD 1.1 -- apologies, CAD 1.1 billion. \r\nIn our impairment review, we have used a more conservative gas price outlook compared to what we use in evaluating our potential GTL and chemical investment opportunities. I want to reemphasize that despite this impairment, we believe that our Canadian shale gas assets continue to provide a strategic hedge for our GTL plans. \r\nMoving to Slide 18. We have seen an overall recovery in sales prices and volumes in our chemical businesses. The focused business turnaround plan in our South African Polymer business has yielded positive results. Polymers reduced its operating loss to ZAR 351 million from ZAR 1.1 billion in the comparative period. This is mainly attributable to a 7% higher production volume increase and improved margin. The EPU5 plant commissioned in October 2013 has brought significant stability and financial benefit to our C2 value chain. The C3 stabilization plant, which is expected to come on stream middle of the calendar year 2014 is expected to further improve feedstock availability to the local business. \r\nOur international Polymer business contributed a profit of ZAR 194 million. This excludes a final loss on disposal of ZAR 198 million for our Arya Sasol Polymers company in Iran. Effective 16 August 2013, Sasol no longer has any investments in Iran. \r\nSolvents delivered a strong operational result despite a challenging economical climate. Improved sales volume, tight cost control and a weaker rand supported the increase in operating profit to ZAR 358 million. In December 2013, we signed an agreement to dispose most of our Solvents Germany asset. This resulted in the impairment of ZAR 466 million. The disposal is still subject to the approval of the European antitrust authorities. Once approved, it's expected that the loss on disposal will be recorded in the second half of the current financial year. \r\nO&S remains the largest contributor to the chemical cluster's operating profit and the second largest contributor to the group's operating profit. Operating profit increased by 75% to ZAR 2.7 billion or an increase of 40% in euro terms. Operating margins expanded almost 2% to 10.4%. Our U.S. business continues to benefit from improved margins on low U.S. ethane prices coupled with high production and sales volumes. \r\nFocusing on operating profit in other chemical businesses. Wax increased its operating profit by 24% on the back of higher volumes, favorable prices and a weaker rand. Overall, the operating profit of this segment decreased by 34% on the back of the challenging market conditions in our fertilizer and ammonia businesses. \r\nMoving on to Slide 19. Our continued focus -- our continued strong cash flow generation from our foundation businesses is evident from a 50% increase in cash generated by our operations amounting to ZAR 28.1 billion. This, together with our deleveraged balance sheet, which reflects our ungeared position of 0.8% at half year, positions us uniquely to fund the steady advancements of our attractive growth projects and deliver on our progressive dividend policy. We have spent ZAR 20 billion of capital investment in the current financial year to date, in line with our expectation of which approximately 54% was in South Africa. We have maintained our capitalization estimate for 2014 of ZAR 42 billion and ZAR 50 billion for 2015. Approximately half of these capital investments over the next 2 years will be spent in South Africa. A large portion of our future growth capital investment will be allocated to our mega growth projects, which is in line with our growth strategy. \r\nTurning on to Slide 20. Taking into account our record headline earnings per share, the ongoing strength of our financial position, the current capital investment plan and our progressive dividend policy, we have increased the interim dividend by 40% to a record ZAR 8 per share. Our dividend yield of approximately 4% and our total shareholder return of 122% in rand terms over the past 5 years continues to position Sasol competitively with our peer group, reinforcing our commitment to consistently return value to our shareholders. Despite our recent strong share price performance, we remain confident in our ability to return further value to our shareholders through sweating our existing current asset base, executing on our growth projects, achieving our business performance enhancement program target, as well as delivering on our progressive dividend policy. \r\nMoving on to Slide 21. We expect macroeconomic conditions to remain volatile. In the near term, we anticipate stable oil prices, slightly improved U.S. natural gas prices, a progressive recovery in chemical product prices and flat refining margins. We assume a slight strengthening in the rand/dollar exchange rate from its current level. We expect an overall solid production performance for 2014 financial year. \r\nSasol Synfuel's volume guidance remains unchanged to be between 7.3 million and 7.5 million tons, international ORYX GTL to maintain full year utilization rate of above 90%, and in Canada, we anticipate marginally decreased production due to reduced drilling activities and fewer new wells coming on stream. We expect normalized cash fixed costs to increase slightly above South African PPI as we incur costs to ensure plant stability. \r\nIn a recent budget speech, the Minister of Finance announced that the implementation of carbon tax would be postponed by a year to 2016. We continue to engage with government on the draft carbon tax legislation. Until we obtain further clarity, we are unable to provide guidance on the impact of carbon tax on our group profit. And lastly, we expect a significant improvement in Polymer's profitability below our previous guidance range for the 2014 financial year. \r\nMoving on to Slide 22. I would like to explain what David touched on earlier in respect of our business performance enhancement program. If you look at the graph, it provides a summary of our cost savings utilization timeline, including the program. As David stated and based on our future analysis, we expect to generate sustainable annual savings of more than ZAR 3 billion from financial year '16. Up to 40% of these savings will be achieved by the end of our 2015 financial year with the balance realized by the following financial year, 2016. We will communicate any potential upside to these savings once we have embedded our new operating model and affected the related structural and process changes. We expect implementation costs for the 2014 financial year to be approximately ZAR 1.2 billion. This will increase somewhat in FY '15 when the program reaches its peak and will taper off in financial year '16 as we finalize the implementation. We expect that costs will follow PPI trends from financial year '16. \r\nIn conclusion, management's continued focus on factors within its control has resulted in a strong overall business performance in a challenging environment and delivered record first half profitability. On that note, I'll hand back to David.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nThanks very much, Paul. I just got a couple of slides to go through before we get to questions. \r\nLooking at Slide 24. The focus here is on our key capital project milestones. We continue to progress the front-end engineering and design of our U.S. growth program, which includes our world-scale ethane cracker complex and a GTL facility in Louisiana. It's anticipated that we'll reach the final investment decision for the cracker project within this calendar year, with FID for the U.S. GTL plant to follow 18 to 24 months thereafter. \r\nTurning to Uzbekistan GTL, we're in an extended FEED phase on the project. The majority of the technical FEED activities have been completed. The FID for this project is dependent upon securing project funding and signing up a new partner to take up 19% of our current stake in the venture. We anticipate reaching financial close during the second half of the 2014 calendar year. \r\nIn Nigeria, the Escravos GTL project is in start-up. Beneficial operation for the first train is expected before the end of June. In South Africa, our ZAR 1.3 billion C3 stabilization project in Secunda remains on track and is expected to be in operation by the middle of this calendar year. \r\nIn Louisiana, we've successfully commissioned our first-of-a-kind 100,000-ton per year ethylene tetramerisation unit for the production of co-monomers. We expect the plant to be fully operational by the end of this financial year. \r\nLooking at our drive to develop further low-carbon power opportunities, we are completing the development of a 140-megawatt gas-fired power plant at Ressano Garcia in Mozambique in partnership with the country's state-owned utility company. Beneficial operation remains on track for the middle of this calendar year. \r\nNow before I close, I'd like to provide you with an update on our upstream projects in the Southern Africa. Over the past 10 years, we've developed the Temane and Pande stranded gas fields in Mozambique through strong in-country partnerships and our technical expertise. Over this period, together with our partners, we've committed approximately $3 billion in capital investment, which includes the development and expansion of our Central Processing Facility and natural gas fields in Southern Mozambique, the construction of the Mozambique/Secunda pipeline and the gas-to-power project in Ressano Garcia I just mentioned. \r\nLooking at our future investments, in November, we declared a notice of commercial discovery of hydrocarbon reservoirs in the Production Sharing Agreement, or PSA, license area. Here, we are on track to submit a field development plan to Mozambican authorities in February 2015. We are also investigating the upside potential of additional resources in the current producing license, the Petroleum Production Agreement, and completed a 2D seismic campaign in onshore license Area A. In addition, we have formulated a portfolio of downstream gas commercialization options to match our resource estimates. We believe that the gas discoveries in the north of Mozambique are large enough to support significant additional gas monetization options outside of LNG. These options include power generation, chemicals and piped gas, which are all aligned with the government drivers specified in the draft Mozambique Gas Master Plan. \r\nNext, looking at our upstream activities closer to home, we recently converted an offshore technical cooperation permit to an exploration right for the Durban and Zululand Basins. And exploration right has an area of 82,117 square kilometers in water depths ranging from 50 to 3,200 meters. This is a 100% Sasol venture and was approved in August 2013 by the Department of Mineral Resources. \r\nSo from this slide, you can see that we have an extremely busy period ahead of us. \r\nTo the final slide. Slide 25 highlights why we believe Sasol remains a compelling investment proposition. This slide summarizes what Paul and I have already covered this afternoon, so I won't run you through the pillars. Suffice it to say that much as FY '13 was all about prioritizing the important and the urgent, FY '14 is all about setting the stage for our future success. We've done our homework, and we are now repositioning Sasol. \r\nWith that, I'll turn it back to the operator for any questions that you may have. Thanks.",
      "transcript_text3": "Just one question on the operations and then one question more on just the balance sheet. The first one, on the operations. I'm just a little bit concerned about volume losses in Natref in the second half of the year as well as in mining -- external mining sales. If can you just comment on the percentage declines relative to 1H? And then the second facility [ph] question just really relates to, I suppose, your U.S. capital commitments. I mean, are you guys still very much comfortable with your CapEx guidance for both the ethane cracker and second of all for the GTL plant? And really, where this is coming from is effectively Shell just basically pulling out of GTL in the U.S. with their initial capital estimates up 50% to 60% being the main reason. So just a comment on that, please.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Jarrett, for the questions. I think, first, on the -- the volume losses at Natref, that's kind of a put and take, and with the shutdown last year and the percentages, I think we're up to 77% this first half. But Bernard, why don't you take on Natref, please?\n\n---\n\nSo Jarrett, it's Bernard. If you talking about the second half of the current financial year, we've moved the shutdown from...\n\n---\n\nFirst half of this financial year, yes.\n\n---\n\nFirst of the financial year, we -- shutdown has moved up. That's why the second half was a little bit lower than the first half. Otherwise, as David said, the facilities are running quite low.\n\n---\n\nMining -- the question on mining was around -- did you say volumes or -- Jarrett? Volumes?\n\n---\n\nYes, volumes, please, David.\n\n---\n\nGiullean?\n\n---\n\nYes, if we compare the forecasted second half to the first half, we had -- in the second quarter of financial year '14, we had label issues, which has now being solved, number one; and number two, we had some issues with the development facility with some tough areas geologically. And we believe that's been solved; and thirdly now, the Twistdraai mine expansion, that Sasol Syferfontein colliery, that's the expansion into the highwall. That will come online, we hope, in the next 2 to 3 weeks. We're just waiting for some permitting issues to resolve. So we're quite comfortable that the volumes will pick up, and we don't see any supply issues to Synfuels.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Giullean. And on to capital commitments and specifically in North America. Certainly, the cracker -- as you can see from our results, the existing cracker in Louisiana is certainly printing money for us with the low-ethane feedstock costs, and we're looking forward to getting to an FID decision on the new cracker and derivative units here in calendar year '14. So that's full steam ahead on the cracker. We want to expand that production capacity as quickly as possible, and we're looking forward to moving forward on the project. At GTL, also from our perspective, and our technology numbers still look very robust. We're doing lots of homework. We've kicked off the FEED in Italy with Technip, looking at different options for over-the-fencing certain capital to our suppliers, industrial gases plus re-cogeneration. So still lots of work to be done on the front end to -- before we can nail down the capital estimate on the GTL. But so far so good, and we're very comfortable. The decision on Shell's part, obviously they are pulling back their CapEx in a number of regions in the world, the Arctic; Australia; in the U.S., specifically Louisiana and elsewhere as they are challenged with other things going on, on their side. So if you just compare our 2 technologies, we're very comfortable that -- for example, our reactor intensity and our ability to scale up our reactors in comparison to the other technology we're competing against is superior, and we're, like I said, still very bullish on the GTL plant in the U.S. Next -- thanks, Jarrett. Next question.\n\n---\n\nDavid, now just a couple of questions around Phoenix. Now that you're willing to do the project, can you maybe give us some guidance as to what the optimum headcount levels in the organization's -- in the organization is? And how much of the ZAR 3 billion savings costs would you say are labor costs? And what are the other costs that you intend taking out of the business? And I guess from Paul's chart, it looks like it's about ZAR 4 billion -- ZAR 4.2 billion worth of costs for the project. How much would -- of that would be deductible from tax? Maybe if you can give us some guidance on that. And then just maybe, I was hoping that the permits for the Lake Charles facilities would come through by the end of last year. It doesn't seem to have happened yet. Can you give us an update on where you stand with the permits?\n\n---\n\nOkay. A couple of questions, actually 4 questions. So on headcount, what I can say, yes, we are into the project, Gerhard, primarily in our top management structures. We're working hard at the GEC, GEC 1, GEC 2 and GEC level. So all the way down to 3 levels below the GEC, we will have in place by July 1 so that we can start up the new operating model and the new reporting -- financial reporting requirements. So still, as far as what the headcount will look like for the entire program, too early to say. But again, as I said earlier, we're very comfortable that there's quite a bit of upside to the annual ZAR 3 billion in savings that we're targeting in FY '16. And again, I'll just have to say more to come with respect to workforce transition, but we are working that properly. We have, through our group partnership, formed -- been in detailed discussions with all of our stakeholders, including the union, who have all signed up on our workforce transition policies on how we'll be moving forward. And so we don't see any issue there, and that's very good news for us to go forward in a -- obviously, a respectful and fair fashion as we move through this process. The split between the ZAR 3 billion -- more than ZAR 3 billion in savings and how much is labor and how much is spread across other parts of the line item, we've got 10 different streams that drive these savings from the new operating model, which drives the different management structure, which, of course, drives headcount. But you've also got inbound supply chain cost savings, you've got fit-for-purpose functions that will be much more cost effective. So you've got operational productivity out in the field, big savings coming from improving our productivity in our operations. So I will just quickly check with Riaan, but I don't think we have definitely released -- or I haven't seen those numbers myself, put it that way. So again, more to come on that front as well. The -- this one is for you, Paul. The ZAR 1.2 billion approximately, I'm not sure if it will get to that amount, but over ZAR 1 billion in costs for FY '14 for Phoenix. It looks like Gerhard has done some measurements of our graphs there. But why don't you discuss the tax opportunity for deductions of this cost?\n\n---\n\nYes, we haven't discussed that. Currently, what we also signaled is that the make-up of that cost basically is the implementation of changes to our ERP system, restructuring costs and also the implementation, as we said, that we obtained from our American consultant. So obviously, all 3 layers are due to definitely from a tax perspective. We have obviously believed that over time, we will be able to deduct the tax. However, the treatment and how quickly you can deduct it, meaning, what income by nature, whether you can deduct it in 1 year or over a period of years, we still need to finally firm up. But we have -- I believe that most of the costs will be, over time, deductible.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Paul. Then final question on permits in the U.S., there's 2 key permits there. The air and water permit with the LDEQ, Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, and then the wetlands permit that's sitting with the Corps of Engineers, all overseen by the federal EPA or Region 6 EPA out of Dallas. Right now, there's no issues that we see, Gerhard, but it is taking longer. There's a lot of paperwork involved. And I think the latest for both of the permits to be approved is in the May to June time frame. Steve Cornell -- Steve you're on the line. I'm not sure if you had anything additional to add to that, but I think that's where we're at right now.\n\n---\n\nDavid, you said it well. It's -- the process is progressing as we hoped. It's a collaborative process with the relevant agencies and all the signals are positive. And we do expect that in -- by hopefully June or earlier, we will have all permits required.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Gerhard, for the question. So we'll move on.\n\n---\n\nJust on your cost reduction program, that ZAR 3 billion target, can you just indicate, is that a real reduction in cash costs? Or is it a saving from the business-as-usual trend? And could you just clarify, I think as Gerhard said, it sort of works out to ZAR 4 billion. But can you just indicate exactly what's your margin FY '15 and FY '16 in terms of costs to implement this program? And just the last thing, in terms of Canadian gas fields, you've had a chance now to discuss with new partners there. I mean, what's their aim with the gas fields in terms of ramp-up? And also, the end demand for the gas?\n\n---\n\nGreat. Thanks, Nishal. I'll -- I think I'll give the first 2 to Paul. The first one is the Phoenix ZAR 3 billion savings, real versus savings from business-as-usual. Paul?\n\n---\n\nYes. Nishal, the ZAR 3 billion is a real reduction. So obviously, as you normalize it into FY '16 or '15 values, it will be different. So you can tag it as a real reduction. The cost to implement the program, we are currently not disclosing it. For the first year, we're obviously are so busy with certain focuses on management workforce transition. We're focusing on ERP system implementation. And for that, we really got our minds around the ZAR 1.2 billion. There obviously is a lot more work if you were to do post-Day 1 implementation on 1st of July. And once we confirm and wrap up the costs for FY '15, we'll then communicate that when the appropriate time for that is.\n\n---\n\nAnd then finally, on the Canadian gas new partner, very pleased to have Progress Energy on board, whose parent organization, PETRONAS, is a good partner of ours in various plays around the world. So it's good to have a strong partner on board with us. And they also are the, if you will, the big dog in Western Canada shale gas. They have the most acreage and the most -- in fact, I think they've got 28 drill rigs north of us operating right now. And they're operating a much more -- I think up to 25% lower drilling and completion cost, which we want to take advantage of as well to learn from that. So we're excited about them coming on board. Their play north of us is to -- is for the LNG facility that PETRONAS is working on over on the coast of British Columbia. So that gas will go that direction. But this play into our field gives them additional optionality, and we'll be working on -- as they get onboard. I think the deal finalizes on Wednesday when we can actually start talking to them seriously about what the plans look like going forward. But again, very positive partner for us, and I'm sure we'll be aligned on the field development as we proceed in the low -- with low gas prices. That means keeping the rig count at a reasonably, fairly low level. Ernst, anything to add?\n\n---\n\nNothing to add.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Nishal.\n\n---\n\nMy first question is it looks like you kept your CapEx forecasts the same for this year and next year. And yet, if I add up the coal tar and the VOC and the tank and the wax and those other things, about another ZAR 2.5 billion on there and, obviously, the currency has weakened. So how confident are you in your CapEx forecasts in the face of that? And then maybe also, looking at the ethylene cracker, I think, today, Shin-Etsu came out with a much smaller project. But the world and its brother wants to build crackers on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The wage rates are already going up. There's a fair chance that we're going to see some CapEx inflation. Could you maybe just compare and contrast the issues locally and in the Gulf Coast and how you intend to bring down the CapEx inflation in both areas? That's my first question. Then also, if I look at the U.S. profits, about ZAR 270 million, so if I sort of multiply that up on the size of your cracker for the new project, I get to around about ZAR 2 billion. Is that your expectation roughly for run rate on the project? Yes, those are my 2 questions.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. Thanks, Alex. We'll start with the CapEx and our confidence in those numbers when taking into consideration coal tar and VOC. Paul is going to take that. Thanks, Paul.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Alex. Yes, so basically, for FY '15, we do start Thubelisha [ph]. We're still comfortable with the ZAR 50 billion. Also you have to bear in mind that capital expenditure and cash flow associated with those projects we'll be seeing up all in FY '15, and most we'll actually be seeing post FY '15. Also in FY '15, there's a couple of projects that fall off your list and some that comes on your list. In evaluating our preferred portfolio, we do believe that the ZAR 50 billion is still, we feel, a believable preferred [ph] portfolio despite these increases in capital costs that we currently see.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Paul. On containment of CapEx inflation, maybe myself and Steve will take the Gulf Coast and I'll look to Ernst to talk locally. Alex, in the most recent discussions with our colleagues in the U.S. and also with our contractors, it seems like the big heating up in the market, hypervolatility in the marketplace on the Gulf coast has not taken place as we originally thought it would or as the industry was projecting for manpower loading and the billions of dollars that are going to be FID-ed there in LNG terminals and crackers and our GTL in the future. So we don't see that pressure materializing on wage rates at this moment. Again, knock on wood that the permits come in here in a timely fashion and we get into the field and we get the plant built by late 2017. Then we feel we'd be ahead of that curve. And like I said, they all seem to be pushing out in time, which is helpful. So Steve, do you have anything to add on inflation cost -- cost inflation, CapEx cost inflation in the Gulf?\n\n---\n\nYes, let me add. I think you're right that what we're seeing is that the big petrochemical major projects are phased enough that we're not seeing the rapid increase in the wage rates. The other thing, I think, to our favor on that is that most of the big refining expansions have wound down and completed. So it looks like the supply-demand is still in okay shape and we're not seeing anything unusual in terms of the wage areas. And just to add, one of the things we're doing in our contracting strategy is really focusing on cost certainty. So not getting into too much detail, but we absolutely are focused on making sure we have cost certainty going into and coming out of the project.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Thank you, Steve. Ernst, a little closer to home, any comments on interest and inflation. And we're get -- coming to wage season as well, but...\n\n---\n\nCost inflation and labor productivity remains an issue, but we are focusing on our capital expense programs, so our planning and our engineering and the work that we do up front, doing all the proper delivery later, that is a key focus from our side. But cost inflation and productivity remains issues which we have to follow closely and focus on in South Africa.\n\n---\n\nI think also, in our substituent board discussions, Alex, we've come across a -- something that's done elsewhere in the world -- Bernard can probably help me out here. On some of these more challenging projects, we're looking to start to modularize our facilities so you can -- some of our CapEx work at Secunda and put that work into workshops where the productivity is much better than out in the field. And Bernard, any -- just the projects we were thinking about that on, and I think we're looking at it very positively.\n\n---\n\nYes, definitely. And particularly in the consult [indiscernible] space, we -- because it's so congested and such a costly brownfield project, where we've looked to modularization and moving construction off-site as an opportunity, and there looks to be a real benefit for us in doing that.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Bernard. Last question, multi-question. Let's go with the ZAR 2 billion -- the profits and the run rate.\n\n---\n\nYes, Alex. Basically, we don't disclose our operating profit that we're going to generate from this asset. However, what was indicated previously is that we still believe that this asset returns sufficient returns to justify the company's hurdle rate requirements on -- in basic capital of 30% above the weighted average cost of capital. We've also indicated the range of production output that we can expect from this plant to deliver. So basically, all of those 2 [ph] will culminate and ultimately will also have a positive impact in the cash flow generation going forward from our new businesses that we will then also apply in the funding in our GTL projects. So again, it's a project that makes good sense at this stage.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Paul. And that was the cracker we were talking about. I didn't clarify that. Good. Thanks, Alex. We'll take another question, looks like from Tassin.\n\n---\n\nJust a couple of questions. I guess the first one for me is if we look at the performance of Secunda, which is clearly exceptional in H1, can you maybe go through the thinking behind your 7.4 million ton level of production you guided to? Is this going to be raised? Are we still comfortable? And then linked to that is if we look at H2 and going forward, what kind of cost performance do we expect again given how strong the performance was in H1? The second question I have is just relating to the ethane cracker. We've heard you speak about the Canadian asset as being an economic or feedstock hedge for future feedstock requirements within the U.S. Can you explain to me where we are within terms -- are feedstock arrangements for things like the ethane cracker, in particular, how far along are we? How is that going to look to manage those feedstock requirements going forward? And then finally, if you could just give some more color perhaps on the profitability of the South African Polymers business into the second half as you see it at present?\n\n---\n\nGood. Thanks, Tassin. Let's start with Bernard, Secunda. Great first -- since you had a great first half, taking into consideration that largest shutdown ever and the great performance on volumes. Guidance, I think we're still where we were at the start of the year.\n\n---\n\nYes, regarding the [indiscernible] from afar, we'll be at -- we have some work that we want to do towards the end of the period, but also in the second [indiscernible] of the current planning -- with regards -- according to our current plans. That's why we're still in the [indiscernible] commentary [indiscernible] from a far range. For that, and remember, we take out the impact of the total shutdown on an annual basis which really talks to -- just remember that we're normalized in the [indiscernible] range. So we're comfortable with that. I think your second question was about...\n\n---\n\nCost performance in the second half.\n\n---\n\nWell, I'll let Paul take on that.\n\n---\n\nOkay, Tassin, so basically, what we indicated in my voiceovers is that we do expect to spend more money during the second half of the financial year to ensure further plant stability. A lot of these funds will be spent in the Synfuels business. And also, the PPI with Eskom falls away in the second half of this financial year, which will obviously, on a year-by-year basis, increase the cost. So in essence, what we signal, that the cost for the second half of the financial year for Synfuels will be moderately higher compared to SA PPI.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Paul. Next question is on the ethane cracker feedstock and the contracts that we're looking at. It's a great time to be buying some ethane, obviously, in the U.S. And the way we look at that is we take -- we're going to be taking about 80% on term contracts, Tassin, 1 to 3 years, 3 to 5 years, and then the other 20% will be spot. We've identified all of the feedstock required, and I think -- and actually, we've got a second option that may even bring us additional competition into our contracts. So that's going well. I don't -- I'm not sure if they're all signed up yet. I can either ask Ernst or Steve to comment on how things are going on the contracts themselves.\n\n---\n\nWe have...\n\n---\n\nSteve, go.\n\n---\n\nSteve, go ahead.\n\n---\n\nYes, so the negotiations are very close to complete. As you said, we had some different options that we were pursuing, and they're getting very near the finalization on that. Ernst, you may want to add something to that?\n\n---\n\nNo, good.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Okay, last one. Profitability of SA Polymers, this is a good news story that, since the last time we spoke to all of you, things are going extremely well. The ethane purification unit has been just a great addition to the kit. So Paul, any other words on those?\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely. Their contribution to date is significant. We'll also see the benefits of the business turnaround program of management that they've implemented over the past 12 months. So again, we expect a very good second 6 months from Polymers.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thanks, Paul. I think that's it for today. I want to thank everyone for calling in. And thank you for your interest in Sasol and until we speak to you again, please stay safe. Thank you.",

Certainly, the cracker -- as you can see from our results, the existing cracker in Louisiana is certainly printing money for us with the low-ethane feedstock costs, and we're looking forward to getting to an FID decision on the new cracker and derivative units here in calendar year '14. So that's full steam ahead on the cracker. We want to expand that production capacity as quickly as possible, and we're looking forward to moving forward on the project. At GTL, also from our perspective, and our technology numbers still look very robust. We're doing lots of homework. We've kicked off the FEED in Italy with Technip, looking at different options for over-the-fencing certain capital to our suppliers, industrial gases plus re-cogeneration. So still lots of work to be done on the front end to -- before we can nail down the capital estimate on the GTL. But so far so good, and we're very comfortable. The decision on Shell's part, obviously they are pulling back their CapEx in a number of regions in the world, the Arctic; Australia; in the U.S., specifically Louisiana and elsewhere as they are challenged with other things going on, on their side. So if you just compare our 2 technologies, we're very comfortable that -- for example, our reactor intensity and our ability to scale up our reactors in comparison to the other technology we're competing against is superior, and we're, like I said, still very bullish on the GTL plant in the U.S. Next -- thanks, Jarrett. Next question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gerhard Engelbrecht (Analysts)】\nDavid, now just a couple of questions around Phoenix. Now that you're willing to do the project, can you maybe give us some guidance as to what the optimum headcount levels in the organization's -- in the organization is? And how much of the ZAR 3 billion savings costs would you say are labor costs? And what are the other costs that you intend taking out of the business? And I guess from Paul's chart, it looks like it's about ZAR 4 billion -- ZAR 4.2 billion worth of costs for the project. How much would -- of that would be deductible from tax? Maybe if you can give us some guidance on that. And then just maybe, I was hoping that the permits for the Lake Charles facilities would come through by the end of last year. It doesn't seem to have happened yet. Can you give us an update on where you stand with the permits?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nOkay. A couple of questions, actually 4 questions. So on headcount, what I can say, yes, we are into the project, Gerhard, primarily in our top management structures. We're working hard at the GEC, GEC 1, GEC 2 and GEC level. So all the way down to 3 levels below the GEC, we will have in place by July 1 so that we can start up the new operating model and the new reporting -- financial reporting requirements. So still, as far as what the headcount will look like for the entire program, too early to say. But again, as I said earlier, we're very comfortable that there's quite a bit of upside to the annual ZAR 3 billion in savings that we're targeting in FY '16. And again, I'll just have to say more to come with respect to workforce transition, but we are working that properly. We have, through our group partnership, formed -- been in detailed discussions with all of our stakeholders, including the union, who have all signed up on our workforce transition policies on how we'll be moving forward. And so we don't see any issue there, and that's very good news for us to go forward in a -- obviously, a respectful and fair fashion as we move through this process. The split between the ZAR 3 billion -- more than ZAR 3 billion in savings and how much is labor and how much is spread across other parts of the line item, we've got 10 different streams that drive these savings from the new operating model, which drives the different management structure, which, of course, drives headcount. But you've also got inbound supply chain cost savings, you've got fit-for-purpose functions that will be much more cost effective. So you've got operational productivity out in the field, big savings coming from improving our productivity in our operations. So I will just quickly check with Riaan, but I don't think we have definitely released -- or I haven't seen those numbers myself, put it that way. So again, more to come on that front as well. The -- this one is for you, Paul. The ZAR 1.2 billion approximately, I'm not sure if it will get to that amount, but over ZAR 1 billion in costs for FY '14 for Phoenix. It looks like Gerhard has done some measurements of our graphs there. But why don't you discuss the tax opportunity for deductions of this cost?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Victor (Executives)】\nYes, we haven't discussed that. Currently, what we also signaled is that the make-up of that cost basically is the implementation of changes to our ERP system, restructuring costs and also the implementation, as we said, that we obtained from our American consultant. So obviously, all 3 layers are due to definitely from a tax perspective. We have obviously believed that over time, we will be able to deduct the tax. However, the treatment and how quickly you can deduct it, meaning, what income by nature, whether you can deduct it in 1 year or over a period of years, we still need to finally firm up. But we have -- I believe that most of the costs will be, over time, deductible.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nThanks, Paul. Then final question on permits in the U.S., there's 2 key permits there. The air and water permit with the LDEQ, Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, and then the wetlands permit that's sitting with the Corps of Engineers, all overseen by the federal EPA or Region 6 EPA out of Dallas. Right now, there's no issues that we see, Gerhard, but it is taking longer. There's a lot of paperwork involved. And I think the latest for both of the permits to be approved is in the May to June time frame. Steve Cornell -- Steve you're on the line. I'm not sure if you had anything additional to add to that, but I think that's where we're at right now.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Cornell (Executives)】\nDavid, you said it well. It's -- the process is progressing as we hoped. It's a collaborative process with the relevant agencies and all the signals are positive. And we do expect that in -- by hopefully June or earlier, we will have all permits required.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nThanks, Gerhard, for the question. So we'll move on.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nishal Ramloutan (Analysts)】\nJust on your cost reduction program, that ZAR 3 billion target, can you just indicate, is that a real reduction in cash costs? Or is it a saving from the business-as-usual trend? And could you just clarify, I think as Gerhard said, it sort of works out to ZAR 4 billion. But can you just indicate exactly what's your margin FY '15 and FY '16 in terms of costs to implement this program? And just the last thing, in terms of Canadian gas fields, you've had a chance now to discuss with new partners there. I mean, what's their aim with the gas fields in terms of ramp-up? And also, the end demand for the gas?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nGreat. Thanks, Nishal. I'll -- I think I'll give the first 2 to Paul. The first one is the Phoenix ZAR 3 billion savings, real versus savings from business-as-usual. Paul?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Victor (Executives)】\nYes. Nishal, the ZAR 3 billion is a real reduction. So obviously, as you normalize it into FY '16 or '15 values, it will be different. So you can tag it as a real reduction. The cost to implement the program, we are currently not disclosing it. For the first year, we're obviously are so busy with certain focuses on management workforce transition. We're focusing on ERP system implementation. And for that, we really got our minds around the ZAR 1.2 billion. There obviously is a lot more work if you were to do post-Day 1 implementation on 1st of July. And once we confirm and wrap up the costs for FY '15, we'll then communicate that when the appropriate time for that is.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nAnd then finally, on the Canadian gas new partner, very pleased to have Progress Energy on board, whose parent organization, PETRONAS, is a good partner of ours in various plays around the world. So it's good to have a strong partner on board with us. And they also are the, if you will, the big dog in Western Canada shale gas. They have the most acreage and the most -- in fact, I think they've got 28 drill rigs north of us operating right now. And they're operating a much more -- I think up to 25% lower drilling and completion cost, which we want to take advantage of as well to learn from that. So we're excited about them coming on board. Their play north of us is to -- is for the LNG facility that PETRONAS is working on over on the coast of British Columbia. So that gas will go that direction. But this play into our field gives them additional optionality, and we'll be working on -- as they get onboard. I think the deal finalizes on Wednesday when we can actually start talking to them seriously about what the plans look like going forward. But again, very positive partner for us, and I'm sure we'll be aligned on the field development as we proceed in the low -- with low gas prices. That means keeping the rig count at a reasonably, fairly low level. Ernst, anything to add?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ernst Oberholster (Executives)】\nNothing to add.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nThanks, Nishal.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alex Comer (Analysts)】\nMy first question is it looks like you kept your CapEx forecasts the same for this year and next year. And yet, if I add up the coal tar and the VOC and the tank and the wax and those other things, about another ZAR 2.5 billion on there and, obviously, the currency has weakened. So how confident are you in your CapEx forecasts in the face of that? And then maybe also, looking at the ethylene cracker, I think, today, Shin-Etsu came out with a much smaller project. But the world and its brother wants to build crackers on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The wage rates are already going up. There's a fair chance that we're going to see some CapEx inflation. Could you maybe just compare and contrast the issues locally and in the Gulf Coast and how you intend to bring down the CapEx inflation in both areas? That's my first question. Then also, if I look at the U.S. profits, about ZAR 270 million, so if I sort of multiply that up on the size of your cracker for the new project, I get to around about ZAR 2 billion. Is that your expectation roughly for run rate on the project? Yes, those are my 2 questions.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nOkay, great. Thanks, Alex. We'll start with the CapEx and our confidence in those numbers when taking into consideration coal tar and VOC. Paul is going to take that. Thanks, Paul.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Victor (Executives)】\nThanks, Alex. Yes, so basically, for FY '15, we do start Thubelisha [ph]. We're still comfortable with the ZAR 50 billion. Also you have to bear in mind that capital expenditure and cash flow associated with those projects we'll be seeing up all in FY '15, and most we'll actually be seeing post FY '15. Also in FY '15, there's a couple of projects that fall off your list and some that comes on your list. In evaluating our preferred portfolio, we do believe that the ZAR 50 billion is still, we feel, a believable preferred [ph] portfolio despite these increases in capital costs that we currently see.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nThanks, Paul. On containment of CapEx inflation, maybe myself and Steve will take the Gulf Coast and I'll look to Ernst to talk locally. Alex, in the most recent discussions with our colleagues in the U.S. and also with our contractors, it seems like the big heating up in the market, hypervolatility in the marketplace on the Gulf coast has not taken place as we originally thought it would or as the industry was projecting for manpower loading and the billions of dollars that are going to be FID-ed there in LNG terminals and crackers and our GTL in the future. So we don't see that pressure materializing on wage rates at this moment. Again, knock on wood that the permits come in here in a timely fashion and we get into the field and we get the plant built by late 2017. Then we feel we'd be ahead of that curve. And like I said, they all seem to be pushing out in time, which is helpful. So Steve, do you have anything to add on inflation cost -- cost inflation, CapEx cost inflation in the Gulf?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Cornell (Executives)】\nYes, let me add. I think you're right that what we're seeing is that the big petrochemical major projects are phased enough that we're not seeing the rapid increase in the wage rates. The other thing, I think, to our favor on that is that most of the big refining expansions have wound down and completed. So it looks like the supply-demand is still in okay shape and we're not seeing anything unusual in terms of the wage areas. And just to add, one of the things we're doing in our contracting strategy is really focusing on cost certainty. So not getting into too much detail, but we absolutely are focused on making sure we have cost certainty going into and coming out of the project.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nGreat. Thank you, Steve. Ernst, a little closer to home, any comments on interest and inflation. And we're get -- coming to wage season as well, but...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ernst Oberholster (Executives)】\nCost inflation and labor productivity remains an issue, but we are focusing on our capital expense programs, so our planning and our engineering and the work that we do up front, doing all the proper delivery later, that is a key focus from our side. But cost inflation and productivity remains issues which we have to follow closely and focus on in South Africa.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nI think also, in our substituent board discussions, Alex, we've come across a -- something that's done elsewhere in the world -- Bernard can probably help me out here. On some of these more challenging projects, we're looking to start to modularize our facilities so you can -- some of our CapEx work at Secunda and put that work into workshops where the productivity is much better than out in the field. And Bernard, any -- just the projects we were thinking about that on, and I think we're looking at it very positively.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Bernard Ekhard Klingenberg (Executives)】\nYes, definitely. And particularly in the consult [indiscernible] space, we -- because it's so congested and such a costly brownfield project, where we've looked to modularization and moving construction off-site as an opportunity, and there looks to be a real benefit for us in doing that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nThanks, Bernard. Last question, multi-question. Let's go with the ZAR 2 billion -- the profits and the run rate.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Victor (Executives)】\nYes, Alex. Basically, we don't disclose our operating profit that we're going to generate from this asset. However, what was indicated previously is that we still believe that this asset returns sufficient returns to justify the company's hurdle rate requirements on -- in basic capital of 30% above the weighted average cost of capital. We've also indicated the range of production output that we can expect from this plant to deliver. So basically, all of those 2 [ph] will culminate and ultimately will also have a positive impact in the cash flow generation going forward from our new businesses that we will then also apply in the funding in our GTL projects. So again, it's a project that makes good sense at this stage.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nThanks, Paul. And that was the cracker we were talking about. I didn't clarify that. Good. Thanks, Alex. We'll take another question, looks like from Tassin.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tassin Meyer (Analysts)】\nJust a couple of questions. I guess the first one for me is if we look at the performance of Secunda, which is clearly exceptional in H1, can you maybe go through the thinking behind your 7.4 million ton level of production you guided to? Is this going to be raised? Are we still comfortable? And then linked to that is if we look at H2 and going forward, what kind of cost performance do we expect again given how strong the performance was in H1? The second question I have is just relating to the ethane cracker. We've heard you speak about the Canadian asset as being an economic or feedstock hedge for future feedstock requirements within the U.S. Can you explain to me where we are within terms -- are feedstock arrangements for things like the ethane cracker, in particular, how far along are we? How is that going to look to manage those feedstock requirements going forward? And then finally, if you could just give some more color perhaps on the profitability of the South African Polymers business into the second half as you see it at present?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nGood. Thanks, Tassin. Let's start with Bernard, Secunda. Great first -- since you had a great first half, taking into consideration that largest shutdown ever and the great performance on volumes. Guidance, I think we're still where we were at the start of the year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Bernard Ekhard Klingenberg (Executives)】\nYes, regarding the [indiscernible] from afar, we'll be at -- we have some work that we want to do towards the end of the period, but also in the second [indiscernible] of the current planning -- with regards -- according to our current plans. That's why we're still in the [indiscernible] commentary [indiscernible] from a far range. For that, and remember, we take out the impact of the total shutdown on an annual basis which really talks to -- just remember that we're normalized in the [indiscernible] range. So we're comfortable with that. I think your second question was about...\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nCost performance in the second half.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Bernard Ekhard Klingenberg (Executives)】\nWell, I'll let Paul take on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Victor (Executives)】\nOkay, Tassin, so basically, what we indicated in my voiceovers is that we do expect to spend more money during the second half of the financial year to ensure further plant stability. A lot of these funds will be spent in the Synfuels business. And also, the PPI with Eskom falls away in the second half of this financial year, which will obviously, on a year-by-year basis, increase the cost. So in essence, what we signal, that the cost for the second half of the financial year for Synfuels will be moderately higher compared to SA PPI.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nThanks, Paul. Next question is on the ethane cracker feedstock and the contracts that we're looking at. It's a great time to be buying some ethane, obviously, in the U.S. And the way we look at that is we take -- we're going to be taking about 80% on term contracts, Tassin, 1 to 3 years, 3 to 5 years, and then the other 20% will be spot. We've identified all of the feedstock required, and I think -- and actually, we've got a second option that may even bring us additional competition into our contracts. So that's going well. I don't -- I'm not sure if they're all signed up yet. I can either ask Ernst or Steve to comment on how things are going on the contracts themselves.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Cornell (Executives)】\nWe have...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Bernard Ekhard Klingenberg (Executives)】\nSteve, go.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nSteve, go ahead.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Cornell (Executives)】\nYes, so the negotiations are very close to complete. As you said, we had some different options that we were pursuing, and they're getting very near the finalization on that. Ernst, you may want to add something to that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ernst Oberholster (Executives)】\nNo, good.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nGreat. Okay, last one. Profitability of SA Polymers, this is a good news story that, since the last time we spoke to all of you, things are going extremely well. The ethane purification unit has been just a great addition to the kit. So Paul, any other words on those?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Victor (Executives)】\nAbsolutely. Their contribution to date is significant. We'll also see the benefits of the business turnaround program of management that they've implemented over the past 12 months. So again, we expect a very good second 6 months from Polymers.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nOkay. Thanks, Paul. I think that's it for today. I want to thank everyone for calling in. And thank you for your interest in Sasol and until we speak to you again, please stay safe. Thank you.",

      "transcript_text1": "Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for coming. Once again, we would like to begin our strategic presentation with a video that speaks louder than words of who we are and what we have done. You have just seen how our strategy has been turned into investments and saving for the country, growth and efficiency for the company, profits and return for our shareholders. All tangible results, achieved with a sustainable approach, a close attention to sustainability, essential for responsibility and respect for our stakeholders. Terna's management style is genuinely reflected into the ethical principle and regulation of our code of ethics, but it is also recognized by the inclusion of our stock in the main sustainability indexes. \r\nWell, after this very brief opening, I leave the floor to our CFO, Flavio Cattaneo, who will recommend the new targets. Later on, Andrea Crenna will comment the 2013 results.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Luigi, and good morning, everybody. Well, thanks to our continuous effort, the ninth addition, kicks off with a 33rd consecutive quarter of growth. The ability to translate processes and action into concrete result is our footprint consolidated in years of tough operating and financial discipline. \r\nRevenues are up by 5%, while EBITDA by more than 6%. The EBITDA margin stepped forward, exceeding 78%, our historical peak. Group net income reached 5 1 4, EUR 514 million, with a double-digit growth year-on-year. This result has more than doubled the level of 9 years ago. Net debt at EUR 6.6 billion is in line with our guidance, while the over EUR 1.2 billion CapEx is of high quality level with 80% incentivized investment. \r\nLater on, Mr. Crenna will further comment the result, while I'd like to introduce the strategic target starting from our long path to growth. Since '05, Terna has invested almost EUR 8 billion with a peak EUR 1.2 billion, annual spending in the last 3 years. We feel the infrastructure's gap between Italy and the rest of the Europe, generating up to now more than EUR 5 billion savings for the system. The savings will triple, including all the future benefits. RAB recently exceed EUR 12 billion, doubling the '05 asset base. Operational and financial efficiencies further enhanced earnings, which on a cumulative basis, amounted to EUR 4.2 billion. I remind that 30% of these earnings has been generated by our entrepreneurial approach in our traditional activities. Now consider it a key driver for our dual strategy. \r\nThe combination of this path and some external condition have gradually changed the general framework and the challenges we have to face. Indeed, as expected, the interim review brought the WACC market -- sorry, down from a 7.4% to 6.3%. Fortunately, the positive impact of RAB evolution offset WACC revision, confirming total grade fee substantially flat year-on-year. As a result, our efforts have been adjusted to preserve good profitability and sound credit metrics. \r\nWell, getting to tomorrow, as you see on Page 8, we are confirming our dual strategy with the strong vision that the value creation is shaped on the solid floor on traditional activities and the encouraging potential of now traditional activities. NTAs are [indiscernible] and intermittent are down. On the contrary, the potential is a natural and fundamental evolution of Terna's value. \r\nSo looking at target on the next slide. For the first time since '09, our 5-year CapEx target in the grid is below $4 billion. Nonetheless, annual RAB growth is expected to grow to 5% and the blended return will reach 7.7%. On nontraditional side, we are confirming the potential of EUR 900 million over the amount of contracts already included in the plan. Differently from last year, today, we rely ongoing deals that bring our overall effort to EUR 1.3 billion. Notwithstanding lower WACC, the EBITDA margin will exceed the 79% in '18, while the net debt on RAB ratio is confirmed well below 60%. \r\nLooking at the traditional activities now. The grid development needs are confirmed in the region of EUR 8 billion. But on a grid project selectivity and some delays by local opposition have reshaped the spending now shift over the longer time frame. The plan foresees EUR 5.6 billion by '23, and the rest beyond the 10-year horizon. This whole thing is obviously reflected in our 5 year CapEx plan. \r\nIn which, as anticipated, we'll spend of EUR 3.6 billion dollars, more than half of the spending is concentrated in the first 2 years. The mix is still compelling, over 80% will be remunerated with a framework of incentives when known in the next 2 years. In the longer run, as expected, CapEx will normalize at the lower level. \r\nFew more words on storage now. We are pioneers among the first in the world in the extensive application of storage system as element of the grid. CapEx will be around EUR 200 million over the EUR 60 million already spent. We are progressing well, both in power and energy intensive project. We are currently executing the first phase of the power intensive project, the so-called storage lab consisting and the testing of different technologies. The testing concern the first 60-megawatt and the remaining 24-megawatt that will follow soon after. Energy intensive project are located in 3 sites in southern Italy, 2 of them already fully authorized and ongoing. \r\nNow moving to RAB and blended returns. Giving the higher starting RAB, growth rate stand in the 5% area, already incorporating the new CapEx profile and the recent inflation trends. As the quality has further improved, the optimal timing of the CapEx executed so far secured a very good RAB mix and enhanced the blended return. Indeed, despite the lower WACC, the blended return always stand above the 7.3% historical level up to 7.7% in '18. \r\nNow moving from traditional to nontraditional activities. As we mentioned before, nontraditional activities are not sporadic opportunities. Indeed, we improve the internal best practice that goes from the scouting to effective contribution in the P&L. On top of the EUR 400 million activities already included in the plan, we are confirming the EUR 900 million potential. And as we said last year, we are talking about a service-based or developer style activities in Italy or abroad. These are mainly driven by contract for third parties, no capital intensive, with an opportunity by opportunity approach during the plan period. In only one year, we have identified opportunities converted into ongoing deals that cover about 50% of last year potential, as I'll comment later on. The potential also includes opportunity with a clear hidden value to you exit like good quality companies facing a restructuring or the acquisition of transmission grid on sale. The driver is to replicate Terna's model in operational and financial discipline, but also in delivery -- in the delivery of realignment and value accretive CapEx plan. A first example is the recent Tamini deal on July '15, a long-running Italian manufacturer recognized for excellence in the sector, both in Italy and abroad and with a very limited financial exposure and good turnaround story. Tamini is a unique opportunity to extract value thanks to synergies and operational efficiencies. The construction of the private interconnection with France is another big deal if a loan represents more than EUR 400 million opportunity. It is core business for us. We'll build and manage the line based on specific agency agreements. Real spending will probably start in '15 after the relevant authorizations and exceptions. \r\nLatam is an interesting region to look at. We are still working on selecting the countries, like Chile, that couples stability and the growth perspective. Our current efforts are focused on both renewable and transmission infrastructures, and we hope to have some good news soon. If so, spending is expected in the second part of the year. \r\nLet's turn to cash flow analysis. We minimize the cash flow impact of the WACC review with a selective CapEx plan, in particular, the operating cash flow, of course, 90% of our need in CapEx and dividend limiting the increase of net debt to only EUR 600 million, EUR 400 million less than old plan. In a nutshell, stronger balance sheet, as you can appreciate from Slide 17. Credit metrics will not come under pressure after the reduction in a low return. And the net depth of RAB is well below the 60% target. And also, net debt on EBITDA will keep its sustainability. The company current financing need until '15 and cost of debt throughout the period, the planned period is expected on average at 2.8%. \r\nLast but not least, dividend policy that we confirm. Indeed, traditional activities provide the floor and nontraditional offer the growth. A comfortable 5% dividend yield coupled with the RAB growth confirms an attractive total return. Today, the board proposed a EUR 0.20 dividend. So in June, our shareholders will get EUR 0.13. And we confirm the interim dividend. \r\nKey take away now. We are holding up the dual strategy, concentrating on asset quality growth and sound return in traditional activities. In nontraditional, the goal is to foster opportunity in different range of prospects or geography. Our risk of various attitude didn't change. We only look where the overall framework is clear and the return are straightforward. Our dual-mode has one single value accretive approach. There is also one other important thing in everything we do, our people, to whom we express much appreciation. \r\nWell, thank you very much for your attention, and I leave the floor to Mr. Crenna for the comment of last year's result. Please?\n\n---\n\nThank you very much, Mr. Cattaneo, and good afternoon, everybody. In 2013, total revenues reached EUR 1.896 million, up 5% versus the previous year. The increase was mainly driven by grid fee, up by EUR 113 million, thanks to inclusion in the RAB of 2011 CapEx. \r\nOther energy item stood at EUR 170 million, up by EUR 9 million versus 2012, mainly due to higher premium for quality of service. We registered EUR 82 million in other activities of which EUR 64 million related to nontraditional activities. When comparing year-on-year, please remember that 2012 results included over EUR 20 million of positive one-off effects, mainly related to the renewal of the fiberoptics contracts and NTAs. \r\nNow moving to the lower part of the profit and loss on the next page. Total operating expenses at EUR 415 million were substantially flat and actually in line with the level of the past 3 years. Strong focus on cost control and revenue growth led to a sound 6.5% growth in EBITDA, up by EUR 91 million at EUR 1.481 million. EBITDA margin reached 78.1%, in line with our guidance and over 1 percentage point higher than 2012. \r\nEBITDA for nontraditional activity was EUR 44 million, which excluding one-off effects accounting in 2012, correspond to a very strong margin of sale of 69%, substantially in line with 2012 and allow to distribute EUR 0.01 of additional dividend. The CapEx dynamics led to an increase of EUR 23 million in DNA to EUR 443 million, driving EBIT to EUR 1.03 million, up 7%. Net financial charges were EUR 100 million, with gross interest costs EUR 190 million, financial income at EUR 61 million and capitalized charges at EUR 26 million. Cost of net debt was down to 2.1%. We accounted taxes for EUR 424 million corresponding to an effective tax rate of 45 plus 2%. Group net income increased EUR 50 million and registered a healthy double digit growth, reaching 400 million -- EUR 414 million. \r\nTurning to CapEx analysis now. Total group CapEx for the third consecutive year have been higher than EUR 1.2 billion. Regulated CapEx were EUR 1,170,000,000, 80% of which incentivized. Other CapEx at EUR 42 million are mainly related to capitalized financial charges. \r\nLet's move now on the next page for net debt evolution. Net debt closed the year at EUR 6,625,000,000, up EUR 770 million in line with our guidance. In 2013, Terna substantially increased the cash flow coverage. Operating cash flow was EUR 928 million or 60% up versus previous year, and cover 57% of our needs in CapEx and dividends. \r\nOur financial structure remains very healthy. As Mr. Cattaneo just said, all our requirements are funded up until 2015 through available liquidity. The maturity profile of our indebtedness has properly spread over the years. And finally, interest rate exposure is prudently balanced with a 68/32 fix to float on net debt. \r\nThank you very much for your attention. We are now ready to take your questions.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Luigi Roth (Executives)】\nGood afternoon, everybody, and thank you for coming. Once again, we would like to begin our strategic presentation with a video that speaks louder than words of who we are and what we have done. You have just seen how our strategy has been turned into investments and saving for the country, growth and efficiency for the company, profits and return for our shareholders. All tangible results, achieved with a sustainable approach, a close attention to sustainability, essential for responsibility and respect for our stakeholders. Terna's management style is genuinely reflected into the ethical principle and regulation of our code of ethics, but it is also recognized by the inclusion of our stock in the main sustainability indexes. \r\nWell, after this very brief opening, I leave the floor to our CFO, Flavio Cattaneo, who will recommend the new targets. Later on, Andrea Crenna will comment the 2013 results.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Flavio Cattaneo (Executives)】\nThank you, Luigi, and good morning, everybody. Well, thanks to our continuous effort, the ninth addition, kicks off with a 33rd consecutive quarter of growth. The ability to translate processes and action into concrete result is our footprint consolidated in years of tough operating and financial discipline. \r\nRevenues are up by 5%, while EBITDA by more than 6%. The EBITDA margin stepped forward, exceeding 78%, our historical peak. Group net income reached 5 1 4, EUR 514 million, with a double-digit growth year-on-year. This result has more than doubled the level of 9 years ago. Net debt at EUR 6.6 billion is in line with our guidance, while the over EUR 1.2 billion CapEx is of high quality level with 80% incentivized investment. \r\nLater on, Mr. Crenna will further comment the result, while I'd like to introduce the strategic target starting from our long path to growth. Since '05, Terna has invested almost EUR 8 billion with a peak EUR 1.2 billion, annual spending in the last 3 years. We feel the infrastructure's gap between Italy and the rest of the Europe, generating up to now more than EUR 5 billion savings for the system. The savings will triple, including all the future benefits. RAB recently exceed EUR 12 billion, doubling the '05 asset base. Operational and financial efficiencies further enhanced earnings, which on a cumulative basis, amounted to EUR 4.2 billion. I remind that 30% of these earnings has been generated by our entrepreneurial approach in our traditional activities. Now consider it a key driver for our dual strategy. \r\nThe combination of this path and some external condition have gradually changed the general framework and the challenges we have to face. Indeed, as expected, the interim review brought the WACC market -- sorry, down from a 7.4% to 6.3%. Fortunately, the positive impact of RAB evolution offset WACC revision, confirming total grade fee substantially flat year-on-year. As a result, our efforts have been adjusted to preserve good profitability and sound credit metrics. \r\nWell, getting to tomorrow, as you see on Page 8, we are confirming our dual strategy with the strong vision that the value creation is shaped on the solid floor on traditional activities and the encouraging potential of now traditional activities. NTAs are [indiscernible] and intermittent are down. On the contrary, the potential is a natural and fundamental evolution of Terna's value. \r\nSo looking at target on the next slide. For the first time since '09, our 5-year CapEx target in the grid is below $4 billion. Nonetheless, annual RAB growth is expected to grow to 5% and the blended return will reach 7.7%. On nontraditional side, we are confirming the potential of EUR 900 million over the amount of contracts already included in the plan. Differently from last year, today, we rely ongoing deals that bring our overall effort to EUR 1.3 billion. Notwithstanding lower WACC, the EBITDA margin will exceed the 79% in '18, while the net debt on RAB ratio is confirmed well below 60%. \r\nLooking at the traditional activities now. The grid development needs are confirmed in the region of EUR 8 billion. But on a grid project selectivity and some delays by local opposition have reshaped the spending now shift over the longer time frame. The plan foresees EUR 5.6 billion by '23, and the rest beyond the 10-year horizon. This whole thing is obviously reflected in our 5 year CapEx plan. \r\nIn which, as anticipated, we'll spend of EUR 3.6 billion dollars, more than half of the spending is concentrated in the first 2 years. The mix is still compelling, over 80% will be remunerated with a framework of incentives when known in the next 2 years. In the longer run, as expected, CapEx will normalize at the lower level. \r\nFew more words on storage now. We are pioneers among the first in the world in the extensive application of storage system as element of the grid. CapEx will be around EUR 200 million over the EUR 60 million already spent. We are progressing well, both in power and energy intensive project. We are currently executing the first phase of the power intensive project, the so-called storage lab consisting and the testing of different technologies. The testing concern the first 60-megawatt and the remaining 24-megawatt that will follow soon after. Energy intensive project are located in 3 sites in southern Italy, 2 of them already fully authorized and ongoing. \r\nNow moving to RAB and blended returns. Giving the higher starting RAB, growth rate stand in the 5% area, already incorporating the new CapEx profile and the recent inflation trends. As the quality has further improved, the optimal timing of the CapEx executed so far secured a very good RAB mix and enhanced the blended return. Indeed, despite the lower WACC, the blended return always stand above the 7.3% historical level up to 7.7% in '18. \r\nNow moving from traditional to nontraditional activities. As we mentioned before, nontraditional activities are not sporadic opportunities. Indeed, we improve the internal best practice that goes from the scouting to effective contribution in the P&L. On top of the EUR 400 million activities already included in the plan, we are confirming the EUR 900 million potential. And as we said last year, we are talking about a service-based or developer style activities in Italy or abroad. These are mainly driven by contract for third parties, no capital intensive, with an opportunity by opportunity approach during the plan period. In only one year, we have identified opportunities converted into ongoing deals that cover about 50% of last year potential, as I'll comment later on. The potential also includes opportunity with a clear hidden value to you exit like good quality companies facing a restructuring or the acquisition of transmission grid on sale. The driver is to replicate Terna's model in operational and financial discipline, but also in delivery -- in the delivery of realignment and value accretive CapEx plan. A first example is the recent Tamini deal on July '15, a long-running Italian manufacturer recognized for excellence in the sector, both in Italy and abroad and with a very limited financial exposure and good turnaround story. Tamini is a unique opportunity to extract value thanks to synergies and operational efficiencies. The construction of the private interconnection with France is another big deal if a loan represents more than EUR 400 million opportunity. It is core business for us. We'll build and manage the line based on specific agency agreements. Real spending will probably start in '15 after the relevant authorizations and exceptions. \r\nLatam is an interesting region to look at. We are still working on selecting the countries, like Chile, that couples stability and the growth perspective. Our current efforts are focused on both renewable and transmission infrastructures, and we hope to have some good news soon. If so, spending is expected in the second part of the year. \r\nLet's turn to cash flow analysis. We minimize the cash flow impact of the WACC review with a selective CapEx plan, in particular, the operating cash flow, of course, 90% of our need in CapEx and dividend limiting the increase of net debt to only EUR 600 million, EUR 400 million less than old plan.

And the net depth of RAB is well below the 60% target. And also, net debt on EBITDA will keep its sustainability.

      "transcript_text3": "Dario Michi from Banca Akros. I have 2 questions. The first one is on the nontraditional activities. If you could please give us an update on all of the nontraditional activities you have already announced, I'm referring to Tamini and Interconnector. The second one is on the RAB value for 2014 and the detail of the deflator you are assuming over the business plan periods. I'm assuming the next is that there is an average level. So if you can give us each value for each year.\n\n---\n\nWe're concerned the update of nontraditional activities, in particular, Tamini and the interconnection. Regarding Tamini, we're talking about a company that's currently built some equipment in electricity sector. And currently, the revenues are around more than EUR 100 million. It's not a big company, but in the past, was more important, than the revenues, more relevant. We -- in part of this revenue, we are as a client for Tamini, but the reason for this acquisition is another one. We think that acquisition plus other opportunity, we can merge together. Or other geographical intent of geographical area of growth, like U.S. or Far East, could push the revenues of Tamini in a positive way. And at that time, Terna don't intend to retain and remain in this sector. The option is the exit, but when we have created the value and when the condition of the market could realize an important return for a profit for our shareholder. Tamini represent the opportunistic approach but into the sector and to the industrial view that Terna have inside in the current management of Terna. Instead, for our concern the interconnection is the normal activity, we do for us, for ourselves everyday with the interconnection. And the change is only the property. Today, we realize infrastructures for us pay from authority. In this case, is the EPC is the construction phase for a third-party. We -- at the moment, we're waiting the exception from the ministry and in particular, authorizations. We think we start this year but the CapEx -- the relevant spending would be in '15. I think this is an important example because it allow Terna to realize the nontraditional activities. Who hired the client, the Italian company. The Italian company that have the possibility to have energy at less price rather than the Italian price. Generally, EUR 40 rather than EUR 60, about, not at end of the year. But at the moment, the differences are about EUR 20. These differences cover the cost of a realization. They pay the annual fees for this realization. The debt is now recourse to Terna because the property is not Terna, but this is a new association or a new company with inside this consumer. And this kind of infrastructures, we can reply in other situation. For this reason, we consider NTAs not only when we fixed last year EUR 900 million. Some of your colleagues asked me that about the dimension, what is -- nontraditional is not possible create a dimension because we're analyzing deal by deal, we create also the opportunity. And in this case, it's a good opportunity. And in my opinion, it's not the first realization for more concern. Infrastructures are totally dedicated to the consumer. In this case, industrial consumer. In addition, we have already showed you our ability to realize renewable. BOO, build, operating and owner, like Brazil. Indeed, we are analyzing some option in Latam for the same replicate and we are -- we keep an eye on also opportunity for grid on sale. And I think I will cover everything in this opportunity. We can -- you can see that the opportunity in nontraditional activities are plenty. When we put on EUR 900 million as dimension, we don't put on an intention. Indeed, we are realizing in terms of agreement already at 50%. Mr. Crenna, for the other element.\n\n---\n\nI think the first question was about the calendar RAB in 2014, which we are currently expecting to be around EUR 12.9 million. The second question was about the deflator we used in the assumptions for the plan. We took an average over the plan period of 1.4%, which would be lower at the beginning of the period and then growing up smoothly.\n\n---\n\nGood morning. Stefano Gamberini, Equita SIM. Three questions, if I may. The first still on nontraditional activities, could you elaborate a little bit on margins of this EUR 400 million and the deals on the existing ones? Margins are in the region of 30%, 40%. I don't know if you can elaborate about these 2 deals that you have in your hands. The second regarding acquisitions. Considering your leverage, which is very low at the end of the plan, do you have some plans or ideas regarding acquisition in traditional assets, in this case? And the last question regarding the allowed WACC that you put in your plan from 2016 onwards. I don't know if this is something that you can disclose or not.\n\n---\n\nFor the margin, Mr. Crenna will answer you because he is more optimistic, unlike me. Now for concerning the acquisition, as I said before, we are available to analyze this opportunity. Obviously, it's important where and the framework. We based with about 2 element, about 2 element, the return -- but this is not only our characteristic, many infrastructure fund see the return -- and EBITDA margin. The current EBITDA margin and what we are able to reach. This is our ability in comparison with the other. The industrial ability to reduce the cost or in double combination like Terna, increasing revenue or reduce the cost. And this is not too easy to find with the other financial subject that intend to participate in some bit. Obviously, if the acquisition are close to Italy, it's better because we save some ticket of plane. And at the moment, this is the situation. But there is not yet starting any opportunity, but if there would be, we get. The margin, mister, the last one...\n\n---\n\nThe assumption on the long haul.\n\n---\n\nThe assumption, please.\n\n---\n\nOkay. On the nontraditional activity margin, I'm going to give you EBITDA margin. We are coming from a profitability over the past 2 years, which was very, very strong, close to 70%. We have taken an assumption, not always on average over the past next 5 years, which is, if I can say, so more prudent, and it's about 50%. On the allowed WACC, we are basically stayed on the 6.3% that we have today. So we have not assumed changes in the WACC, 6.3% flat, base WACC.\n\n---\n\nYes, Stefano Bezzato, Crédit Suisse. Three questions please. The first one on the regulatory cycle. You have a big review coming up next year. Clearly, still one year away, but we have already started hearing politicians saying that network returns are currently too high. We read last year in the gas review that the regulator might push for a public consultation over it in the future to review the regulatory framework. Just wanted to know if how -- what we need to expect next year. Did you have already any discussion with the government regulator? And in particularly -- in particular, considering the current level of sovereign yields, what would be a minimum return level that you would need in order to go ahead with the plan that you present today, with the EUR 3.6 billion of CapEx? The second question is related to that, the dividend. Today you give us visibility for 5 years. In between, there is a full review and an interim review. Is this dividend level committed no matter what the future returns will be? And finally, a third question, just a clarification on the grid sales, grid possible acquisitions that you were mentioning also related to some press article last week regarding potential interest in Greek privatization, would this deal be part -- would these assets become part of the traditional business or the nontraditional activities?\n\n---\n\nSo more concerning the new regulatory period. It's too early to comment about it because next year, but we start 3 months of '14 and it is at the end of '15. It's 2 years in terms of months. But you consider that the WACC base post tax is lower to the European average at the moment. And fortunately, if you analyze also the evolution of the CapEx, you can analyze that we intent preserve the risk for the company and for our shareholder. I will say that we are absolutely not concerned about the reduction in dividend in any situation, even because you can analyze today the result that the EUR 0.19 that it is the base for regulated activities is about, for this year, is less than 80% of payout and the next year will be less. This is not a risk in my opinion, not in my opinion, in our plan. My opinion is not. The privatization of Greek grid, we are interested in. But the auction has not started yet. There will be an expression of an interest. We're waiting on this opportunity. As I said before, it's close to Italy. It's already interconnected with Italy. There is a good condition in terms of returns. There is potential CapEx with incentive. There is an EBITDA margin very low. That is an opportunity for us to create. There is all the characteristic we need for intended an operational deal. What we can offer to the Greek, our professionality, our skill, but also our stability because we have reached our result with our reduction in employees without trouble for the country, without litigation -- in particular, litigation. This is important, even I think for a country that intend to use the growth without problem, but will depend on many factors, many factors. Today is still too early.\n\n---\n\nEnrico Bartoli from MainFirst. Some questions, first of all, I have a question on batteries. You just included the 75 megawatts that you are bidding up. Could you elaborate a bit on, let's say, the potential that you see from this business beyond the 75 megawatts? Obviously, that depends on the attitude of the regulator, but if you think that in the system there will be a need for more investments in this kind of technology. The second question is related to the long term development plan of the grid. It was spread over more years, if I understand, compared to the previous plan. If you can give us some means of the reason of that, if there is something linked also to the Montenegro execution, if there are, indeed, some delays there Or not. And the first one, very -- the third one, very easy, on the CapEx you'll spend for 2014.\n\n---\n\nI will call my colleagues even because they are present is important. It's important. For the battery, Mr. Fiocco, and for the CapEx, Mr. Armani, please.\n\n---\n\nAs far as the storage products are concerned, we are in the process of executing the 75 megawatts that have been scheduled. And we do not have further increases within the same formula of regulated activity. Despite all this, the perspectives for storage opportunities begin to flourish all over Europe and U.S., so there are a number of chances that we are monitoring also for the purposes of considering battery installation as a nontraditional kind of business.\n\n---\n\nArmani, Armani.\n\n---\n\nRegarding CapEx, we have reviewed the National Development Plan based on the indications that were set by the authority leading to a more selective and prioritization of CapEx. And this is, in our view, what is going to be the trend also for the next regulatory period. And therefore, we adjusted our planning also finding new ways to obtain the same results with less expensive solutions. On the other hand, on Montenegro, it's a complex project. We are finding and we are having discussions with all the stakeholders that are involved in the project, in particular the Croatian counterpart. There is an interference with the development of prospects in gas and oil development plans in Montenegro, in Croatian waters, and this may lead to a different planning of the project, but we are solving, of course, all the issues that are underway to complete the projects in line with our expectations.\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nOf course, we also have to take into consideration that we had one of our main projects that was blocked after the Consiglio di Stato pronunciation. This was, of course, unexpected. This led to -- they needed to replan part of the activities. But this is, of course, in the contingency activities that we always certainly manage.\n\n---\n\nThe EUR 3.6 billion CapEx plan over the plan is skewed towards the initial part of the plan. So next year, we will still invest more than EUR 1 billion, although probably a little bit lower than 2013. So something in between.\n\n---\n\nIt's Anna Maria Scaglia from Morgan Stanley. Got just a few questions. On Slide 11, you said that around 67% of the CapEx will receive a 2% premium and 33% a 1.5% premium, where are you positioning the CapEx for the batteries? The second question is regarding your CapEx plan, the EUR 3.6 billion CapEx plan. Is there any inflation to even adjustment? I mean, is it lower because of lower inflation or it's just the moving and timing of project? And also what do you see as a normalized level of CapEx in the long term? Is it EUR 600 million, is it EUR 500 million? And is this level sustainable after the CapEx plan? And just to clarify on Montenegro, is the timeline still the same or not? And also, in the document of the review, the authority was hinting as a discussion with you on the potential returns, are you willing to change the scheme of remuneration of Montenegro?\n\n---\n\nMr. Crenna and Mr. Fiocco for the batteries. Just a few words about the authority in Montenegro, the remuneration is under discussion. Stopped because in business we have obtained authorization and incentive and the company don't intend to discuss the -- about what it has been already authorized. Please?\n\n---\n\nThe second question was that the normal level of CapEx. I'll answer first this question. Let's say, on a steady state stable scenario, what we are expecting is an amount of CapEx around EUR 700 million, more or less, okay? That's going to be, of course, in the long run. It's well beyond the end of the present plan that we are presenting. Batteries are incentivized. I think they are incentivized, the mix of 2% and 1.5%, I don't remember exactly right now out of my mind exactly which percentage on which megawatt. I think we can get back later on to be more precise. The back is on 2%, okay? And -- was there any other question? Sorry, I didn't take note from Morgan Stanley?\n\n---\n\nThe inflation. If there is any inflation in terms of your CapEx going down and you would adjust...\n\n---\n\nNo, it's -- I mean, that amount of CapEx we are expecting to make has not been inflated by any percentage.\n\n---\n\nNominal terms.\n\n---\n\nIn nominal terms, yes.\n\n---\n\nNo, what I meant is that in other companies, we have seen the CapEx plan -- sorry, in other companies, we have see the CapEx plan going down because, of course, the cost of material, the cost of construction has been lower, and that's an element. Of course, you have not such a big cost of material, but I was wondering if there is any...\n\n---\n\nNo, we haven't made this assumption.\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible] we have offer the spend across 3 years ago or 3 years ago. This case the inflation of procurement, although in case of cost of the realization material or not immaterial.\n\n---\n\nIn general, in our supplies, we have an increase in civil works, but metals in general are a big part of our activities have not had a huge impact. So no change on cost on investments is relevant.\n\n---\n\nFederico Pezzetti, Intermonte. Just a clarification on the margins you are expecting from nontraditional activities, just to clarify, if you were talking about the EUR 400 million which are already included in the plan?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. In that case, can you give us an idea of the margins you are expecting on the remaining and, in particular, I guess, I'm thinking about the EUR 400 million which are in progress?\n\n---\n\nNo, because these are not in the plan.\n\n---\n\nWe have specified not at the moment. At the moment, you announced the dimension in the past. Into this amount could be a different kind of deals. If it is EPC or BOO or another grid or another -- or the renewable, the margin are completely different, completely, and completely different risk and so on.\n\n---\n\nI understand. I was referring in particular to the interconnection of Italy and France, of course, on which maybe you might have some more...\n\n---\n\nYou can -- potential of 15%, you can at the moment.\n\n---\n\n1-5?\n\n---\n\n1-5.\n\n---\n\n1-5. Okay. And very quickly...\n\n---\n\nBut I hope my -- could be better, but at the moment...\n\n---\n\nAnd very quickly, I might have missed on -- going back to the results, 2013, what was the average cost of debt and if you could give us a guidance on 2014 cost, average cost of debt and maybe net financial position at the end of the year?\n\n---\n\nYes. On the 2.1%, on the 2013, that's it. There was not a question about that.\n\n---\n\nI missed that, sorry.\n\n---\n\nAll right. Okay. No problem, 2.1%, that's clearly the cost of debt, i.e., on the net financial position.\n\n---\n\nThey never had this.\n\n---\n\nWe have currently an -- 2.8% was the average of the plan, as I think Mr. Cattaneo mentioned during the presentation. In 2014, we are currently expecting a little bit lower than the average of the plan. It's going to be around 2.6%, 2.7%, let me be a little bit more broader on the expectation. On the CapEx -- sorry, on the net financial position, allow me to be not so precise to give you the right number. You have the full variations over the period. You have the CapEx amount. You know more or less how the depreciation is. I think you can work it out quite easily by yourself.\n\n---\n\nA very quick follow-up on Latin America, you mentioned that, if I understand well, you could be interested in renewable projects, in building lines in order to sell them. Do you have some projects in mind, their possible schedule? Are we going to expect something by the end of this year in terms of tenders or on your projects in this business?\n\n---\n\nI leave the floor to our man of South America, Mr. Fiocco. In the past, he has been also the CEO of Terna part in Brazil. He know very well more than me, please.\n\n---\n\nAbout plans in Latam, we are eyeing opportunities both in renewable development and in infrastructural plan, both strengths of business are quite attractive. Many countries are experiencing a rapid growth in the composition of -- the presence of renewable generation in their own electricity systems. And at the same time, they have increasing thirst of infrastructure investments. We have a number of initiatives that we're eyeing at there, both with private counterparts and public entities, that is involving tenders. And most of them are covered by nondisclosure agreements, so I would not comment unless further developments are brought in.\n\n---\n\nOn new areas? Chile?\n\n---\n\nYes, the countries we're eyeing at are the countries that couple the development perspectives I mentioned before, together with a stable framework. So Chile is the first one in the agenda since it is by far and historically one of the Latin American countries that much responds to those requisites.\n\n---\n\nEven because Chile is better than the Feed-in Tariff, because especially in the north of the country, you can reach an agreement, a long agreement, long term, 15 years with private counterparties and different private counterparties for the acquired energy, that allow the company to have a stable cash flow. In this case because there is the same story in every part of -- if there is a stable cash flow, it's possible to reach a good leverage with attractive financing now across the term. And we create a company. Kiss the company, bye, bye. This is our approach. This is not for the BOO. We realize the line. In this case, the same procedure in every part.\r\nWell, there is no other question. Well, thank you so much for your participation, and good afternoon to all the -- or good...\n\n---\n\nGoodbye. Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\nLines.\n\n---\n\nThanks.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Dario Michi (Analysts)】\nDario Michi from Banca Akros. I have 2 questions. The first one is on the nontraditional activities. If you could please give us an update on all of the nontraditional activities you have already announced, I'm referring to Tamini and Interconnector. The second one is on the RAB value for 2014 and the detail of the deflator you are assuming over the business plan periods. I'm assuming the next is that there is an average level. So if you can give us each value for each year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Flavio Cattaneo (Executives)】\nWe're concerned the update of nontraditional activities, in particular, Tamini and the interconnection. Regarding Tamini, we're talking about a company that's currently built some equipment in electricity sector. And currently, the revenues are around more than EUR 100 million. It's not a big company, but in the past, was more important, than the revenues, more relevant. We -- in part of this revenue, we are as a client for Tamini, but the reason for this acquisition is another one. We think that acquisition plus other opportunity, we can merge together. Or other geographical intent of geographical area of growth, like U.S. or Far East, could push the revenues of Tamini in a positive way. And at that time, Terna don't intend to retain and remain in this sector. The option is the exit, but when we have created the value and when the condition of the market could realize an important return for a profit for our shareholder. Tamini represent the opportunistic approach but into the sector and to the industrial view that Terna have inside in the current management of Terna. Instead, for our concern the interconnection is the normal activity, we do for us, for ourselves everyday with the interconnection. And the change is only the property. Today, we realize infrastructures for us pay from authority. In this case, is the EPC is the construction phase for a third-party. We -- at the moment, we're waiting the exception from the ministry and in particular, authorizations. We think we start this year but the CapEx -- the relevant spending would be in '15. I think this is an important example because it allow Terna to realize the nontraditional activities. Who hired the client, the Italian company. The Italian company that have the possibility to have energy at less price rather than the Italian price. Generally, EUR 40 rather than EUR 60, about, not at end of the year. But at the moment, the differences are about EUR 20. These differences cover the cost of a realization. They pay the annual fees for this realization. The debt is now recourse to Terna because the property is not Terna, but this is a new association or a new company with inside this consumer. And this kind of infrastructures, we can reply in other situation. For this reason, we consider NTAs not only when we fixed last year EUR 900 million. Some of your colleagues asked me that about the dimension, what is -- nontraditional is not possible create a dimension because we're analyzing deal by deal, we create also the opportunity. And in this case, it's a good opportunity. And in my opinion, it's not the first realization for more concern. Infrastructures are totally dedicated to the consumer. In this case, industrial consumer. In addition, we have already showed you our ability to realize renewable. BOO, build, operating and owner, like Brazil. Indeed, we are analyzing some option in Latam for the same replicate and we are -- we keep an eye on also opportunity for grid on sale. And I think I will cover everything in this opportunity. We can -- you can see that the opportunity in nontraditional activities are plenty. When we put on EUR 900 million as dimension, we don't put on an intention. Indeed, we are realizing in terms of agreement already at 50%. Mr. Crenna, for the other element.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrea Crenna (Executives)】\nI think the first question was about the calendar RAB in 2014, which we are currently expecting to be around EUR 12.9 million. The second question was about the deflator we used in the assumptions for the plan. We took an average over the plan period of 1.4%, which would be lower at the beginning of the period and then growing up smoothly.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stefano Gamberini (Analysts)】\nGood morning. Stefano Gamberini, Equita SIM. Three questions, if I may. The first still on nontraditional activities, could you elaborate a little bit on margins of this EUR 400 million and the deals on the existing ones? Margins are in the region of 30%, 40%. I don't know if you can elaborate about these 2 deals that you have in your hands. The second regarding acquisitions. Considering your leverage, which is very low at the end of the plan, do you have some plans or ideas regarding acquisition in traditional assets, in this case? And the last question regarding the allowed WACC that you put in your plan from 2016 onwards. I don't know if this is something that you can disclose or not.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Flavio Cattaneo (Executives)】\nFor the margin, Mr. Crenna will answer you because he is more optimistic, unlike me. Now for concerning the acquisition, as I said before, we are available to analyze this opportunity. Obviously, it's important where and the framework. We based with about 2 element, about 2 element, the return -- but this is not only our characteristic, many infrastructure fund see the return -- and EBITDA margin. The current EBITDA margin and what we are able to reach. This is our ability in comparison with the other. The industrial ability to reduce the cost or in double combination like Terna, increasing revenue or reduce the cost. And this is not too easy to find with the other financial subject that intend to participate in some bit. Obviously, if the acquisition are close to Italy, it's better because we save some ticket of plane. And at the moment, this is the situation. But there is not yet starting any opportunity, but if there would be, we get. The margin, mister, the last one...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elisabetta Colacchia (Executives)】\nThe assumption on the long haul.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Flavio Cattaneo (Executives)】\nThe assumption, please.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrea Crenna (Executives)】\nOkay. On the nontraditional activity margin, I'm going to give you EBITDA margin. We are coming from a profitability over the past 2 years, which was very, very strong, close to 70%. We have taken an assumption, not always on average over the past next 5 years, which is, if I can say, so more prudent, and it's about 50%. On the allowed WACC, we are basically stayed on the 6.3% that we have today. So we have not assumed changes in the WACC, 6.3% flat, base WACC.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stefano Bezzato (Analysts)】\nYes, Stefano Bezzato, Crédit Suisse. Three questions please. The first one on the regulatory cycle. You have a big review coming up next year. Clearly, still one year away, but we have already started hearing politicians saying that network returns are currently too high. We read last year in the gas review that the regulator might push for a public consultation over it in the future to review the regulatory framework. Just wanted to know if how -- what we need to expect next year. Did you have already any discussion with the government regulator? And in particularly -- in particular, considering the current level of sovereign yields, what would be a minimum return level that you would need in order to go ahead with the plan that you present today, with the EUR 3.6 billion of CapEx? The second question is related to that, the dividend. Today you give us visibility for 5 years. In between, there is a full review and an interim review. Is this dividend level committed no matter what the future returns will be? And finally, a third question, just a clarification on the grid sales, grid possible acquisitions that you were mentioning also related to some press article last week regarding potential interest in Greek privatization, would this deal be part -- would these assets become part of the traditional business or the nontraditional activities?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Flavio Cattaneo (Executives)】\nSo more concerning the new regulatory period. It's too early to comment about it because next year, but we start 3 months of '14 and it is at the end of '15. It's 2 years in terms of months. But you consider that the WACC base post tax is lower to the European average at the moment. And fortunately, if you analyze also the evolution of the CapEx, you can analyze that we intent preserve the risk for the company and for our shareholder. I will say that we are absolutely not concerned about the reduction in dividend in any situation, even because you can analyze today the result that the EUR 0.19 that it is the base for regulated activities is about, for this year, is less than 80% of payout and the next year will be less. This is not a risk in my opinion, not in my opinion, in our plan. My opinion is not. The privatization of Greek grid, we are interested in. But the auction has not started yet. There will be an expression of an interest. We're waiting on this opportunity. As I said before, it's close to Italy. It's already interconnected with Italy. There is a good condition in terms of returns. There is potential CapEx with incentive. There is an EBITDA margin very low. That is an opportunity for us to create. There is all the characteristic we need for intended an operational deal. What we can offer to the Greek, our professionality, our skill, but also our stability because we have reached our result with our reduction in employees without trouble for the country, without litigation -- in particular, litigation. This is important, even I think for a country that intend to use the growth without problem, but will depend on many factors, many factors. Today is still too early.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Enrico Bartoli (Analysts)】\nEnrico Bartoli from MainFirst. Some questions, first of all, I have a question on batteries. You just included the 75 megawatts that you are bidding up. Could you elaborate a bit on, let's say, the potential that you see from this business beyond the 75 megawatts? Obviously, that depends on the attitude of the regulator, but if you think that in the system there will be a need for more investments in this kind of technology. The second question is related to the long term development plan of the grid. It was spread over more years, if I understand, compared to the previous plan. If you can give us some means of the reason of that, if there is something linked also to the Montenegro execution, if there are, indeed, some delays there Or not. And the first one, very -- the third one, very easy, on the CapEx you'll spend for 2014.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Flavio Cattaneo (Executives)】\nI will call my colleagues even because they are present is important. It's important. For the battery, Mr. Fiocco, and for the CapEx, Mr. Armani, please.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alessandro Fiocco (Executives)】\nAs far as the storage products are concerned, we are in the process of executing the 75 megawatts that have been scheduled. And we do not have further increases within the same formula of regulated activity. Despite all this, the perspectives for storage opportunities begin to flourish all over Europe and U.S., so there are a number of chances that we are monitoring also for the purposes of considering battery installation as a nontraditional kind of business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Flavio Cattaneo (Executives)】\nArmani, Armani.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gianni Armani (Executives)】\nRegarding CapEx, we have reviewed the National Development Plan based on the indications that were set by the authority leading to a more selective and prioritization of CapEx. And this is, in our view, what is going to be the trend also for the next regulatory period. And therefore, we adjusted our planning also finding new ways to obtain the same results with less expensive solutions. On the other hand, on Montenegro, it's a complex project. We are finding and we are having discussions with all the stakeholders that are involved in the project, in particular the Croatian counterpart. There is an interference with the development of prospects in gas and oil development plans in Montenegro, in Croatian waters, and this may lead to a different planning of the project, but we are solving, of course, all the issues that are underway to complete the projects in line with our expectations.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Flavio Cattaneo (Executives)】\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gianni Armani (Executives)】\nOf course, we also have to take into consideration that we had one of our main projects that was blocked after the Consiglio di Stato pronunciation. This was, of course, unexpected. This led to -- they needed to replan part of the activities. But this is, of course, in the contingency activities that we always certainly manage.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrea Crenna (Executives)】\nThe EUR 3.6 billion CapEx plan over the plan is skewed towards the initial part of the plan. So next year, we will still invest more than EUR 1 billion, although probably a little bit lower than 2013. So something in between.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anna Maria Scaglia (Analysts)】\nIt's Anna Maria Scaglia from Morgan Stanley. Got just a few questions. On Slide 11, you said that around 67% of the CapEx will receive a 2% premium and 33% a 1.5% premium, where are you positioning the CapEx for the batteries? The second question is regarding your CapEx plan, the EUR 3.6 billion CapEx plan. Is there any inflation to even adjustment? I mean, is it lower because of lower inflation or it's just the moving and timing of project? And also what do you see as a normalized level of CapEx in the long term? Is it EUR 600 million, is it EUR 500 million? And is this level sustainable after the CapEx plan? And just to clarify on Montenegro, is the timeline still the same or not? And also, in the document of the review, the authority was hinting as a discussion with you on the potential returns, are you willing to change the scheme of remuneration of Montenegro?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Flavio Cattaneo (Executives)】\nMr. Crenna and Mr. Fiocco for the batteries. Just a few words about the authority in Montenegro, the remuneration is under discussion. Stopped because in business we have obtained authorization and incentive and the company don't intend to discuss the -- about what it has been already authorized. Please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrea Crenna (Executives)】\nThe second question was that the normal level of CapEx. I'll answer first this question. Let's say, on a steady state stable scenario, what we are expecting is an amount of CapEx around EUR 700 million, more or less, okay? That's going to be, of course, in the long run. It's well beyond the end of the present plan that we are presenting. Batteries are incentivized. I think they are incentivized, the mix of 2% and 1.5%, I don't remember exactly right now out of my mind exactly which percentage on which megawatt. I think we can get back later on to be more precise. The back is on 2%, okay? And -- was there any other question? Sorry, I didn't take note from Morgan Stanley?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anna Maria Scaglia (Analysts)】\nThe inflation. If there is any inflation in terms of your CapEx going down and you would adjust...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrea Crenna (Executives)】\nNo, it's -- I mean, that amount of CapEx we are expecting to make has not been inflated by any percentage.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Flavio Cattaneo (Executives)】\nNominal terms.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrea Crenna (Executives)】\nIn nominal terms, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anna Maria Scaglia (Analysts)】\nNo, what I meant is that in other companies, we have seen the CapEx plan -- sorry, in other companies, we have see the CapEx plan going down because, of course, the cost of material, the cost of construction has been lower, and that's an element. Of course, you have not such a big cost of material, but I was wondering if there is any...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrea Crenna (Executives)】\nNo, we haven't made this assumption.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Flavio Cattaneo (Executives)】\n[indiscernible] we have offer the spend across 3 years ago or 3 years ago. This case the inflation of procurement, although in case of cost of the realization material or not immaterial.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrea Crenna (Executives)】\nIn general, in our supplies, we have an increase in civil works, but metals in general are a big part of our activities have not had a huge impact. So no change on cost on investments is relevant.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Federico Pezzetti (Analysts)】\nFederico Pezzetti, Intermonte. Just a clarification on the margins you are expecting from nontraditional activities, just to clarify, if you were talking about the EUR 400 million which are already included in the plan?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrea Crenna (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Federico Pezzetti (Analysts)】\nOkay. In that case, can you give us an idea of the margins you are expecting on the remaining and, in particular, I guess, I'm thinking about the EUR 400 million which are in progress?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrea Crenna (Executives)】\nNo, because these are not in the plan.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Flavio Cattaneo (Executives)】\nWe have specified not at the moment. At the moment, you announced the dimension in the past. Into this amount could be a different kind of deals. If it is EPC or BOO or another grid or another -- or the renewable, the margin are completely different, completely, and completely different risk and so on.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Federico Pezzetti (Analysts)】\nI understand. I was referring in particular to the interconnection of Italy and France, of course, on which maybe you might have some more...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Flavio Cattaneo (Executives)】\nYou can -- potential of 15%, you can at the moment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Federico Pezzetti (Analysts)】\n1-5?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Flavio Cattaneo (Executives)】\n1-5.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Federico Pezzetti (Analysts)】\n1-5. Okay. And very quickly...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Flavio Cattaneo (Executives)】\nBut I hope my -- could be better, but at the moment...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Federico Pezzetti (Analysts)】\nAnd very quickly, I might have missed on -- going back to the results, 2013, what was the average cost of debt and if you could give us a guidance on 2014 cost, average cost of debt and maybe net financial position at the end of the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrea Crenna (Executives)】\nYes. On the 2.1%, on the 2013, that's it. There was not a question about that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Federico Pezzetti (Analysts)】\nI missed that, sorry.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrea Crenna (Executives)】\nAll right. Okay. No problem, 2.1%, that's clearly the cost of debt, i.e., on the net financial position.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Flavio Cattaneo (Executives)】\nThey never had this.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrea Crenna (Executives)】\nWe have currently an -- 2.8% was the average of the plan, as I think Mr. Cattaneo mentioned during the presentation.

You know more or less how the depreciation is. I think you can work it out quite easily by yourself.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nA very quick follow-up on Latin America, you mentioned that, if I understand well, you could be interested in renewable projects, in building lines in order to sell them. Do you have some projects in mind, their possible schedule? Are we going to expect something by the end of this year in terms of tenders or on your projects in this business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Flavio Cattaneo (Executives)】\nI leave the floor to our man of South America, Mr. Fiocco. In the past, he has been also the CEO of Terna part in Brazil. He know very well more than me, please.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alessandro Fiocco (Executives)】\nAbout plans in Latam, we are eyeing opportunities both in renewable development and in infrastructural plan, both strengths of business are quite attractive. Many countries are experiencing a rapid growth in the composition of -- the presence of renewable generation in their own electricity systems. And at the same time, they have increasing thirst of infrastructure investments. We have a number of initiatives that we're eyeing at there, both with private counterparts and public entities, that is involving tenders. And most of them are covered by nondisclosure agreements, so I would not comment unless further developments are brought in.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Flavio Cattaneo (Executives)】\nOn new areas?

      "transcript_text1": "Good morning, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our 2013 results conference call. Today, our CEO, Burak, will briefly talk about our operations; and our CFO, Orhun, will share with you the financial review. Following Burak's closing remarks, we will start Q&A session. \r\nBefore we begin, please kindly be advised of our cautionary statement. This conference call may contain forward-looking management comments, including projections. They should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary language contained in this earnings release. A copy of the earnings release and financials are available on our website at www.cci.com.tr. \r\nNow let me turn the call over to Burak.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Deniz. Good afternoon, everyone. I am very delighted to say that we've exceeded 1 billion unit cases of volume for the first time in 2013, supported mainly by the double-digit volume growth in our international markets. Turkey volume returns to growth in the fourth quarter of -- in 2013. This was a result of successful campaigns to reenergize the volume growth in Turkey after the weak third quarter. \r\nI am particularly pleased with the margin improvement in our international markets, driven by strong performance in our key international markets namely Pakistan, Iraq and Kazakhstan. In 2013, our efforts to improve balance sheet health continues with a very successful U.S. private placement in May and a Eurobond in October. With these successful debt issuances, total duration of our debt portfolio extended from 1.2 years to 5 years. \r\nLast year, our consolidated volume growth was 13%. Turkey sales volume increased by 1% despite the decline in the third quarter and the challenging market economic conditions in the second half of the year. International operations contribution to volume growth was 32% in 2013, as all key markets posted strong growth numbers. \r\nTurning to volume breakdown, we are very happy to say that CCI has a more balanced portfolio of business than previous years. International sales volume is now 46% of our total volume in 2013 and up from 39% in 2012. This was achieved by the high-organic growth in Central Asia and Pakistan, as well as acquisition of Al Waha in South Iraq. In 2013, the share of the sparkling category in total mix was at 73%. Sparkling category posted 13% strong growth, driven by brand Coke and Sprite, particularly in international operations. Still category grew by 11%, with a strong growth of Juice, Iced-Tea and Water segments. \r\nNow let me briefly touch base on the operations, beginning first with the Turkey operations. Following the decline in the third quarter, Turkey volume turned to positive 2% growth in the fourth quarter of 2013. The growth was achieved in spite of the persistent uncertainty due to TL's sharp depreciation and also weakening consumer sentiment in the second half of the year. Sparkling beverage category contracted by 1% in 2013, while Coke Zero posted double-digit growth, driven by the relaunch campaign in the first half of the year. The immediate consumption packages shared in the total sparkling mix increased by 100 basis points to 18% in total in 2013 on the back of successful new package introductions in the first half of the year. \r\nStill Beverages, excluding water, grew at high-single digits in 2013, driven by juice and iced-tea categories. In Juice segment, Cappy posted volume growth, supported by the help of new flavors. Fuse Tea continued to grow at high-double digits. The water category contracted by high-single digits, mainly by contraction of our HOD business. This was in line with our strategy to balance water volume growth and to manage profitable details to category. The non-ready-to-drink tea business grew at double digits, driven largely by the loose Black Tea segment. \r\nIn addition to successful Rock'N Coke and Fanta Youth Festival in 2013, very successful consumer promotions and activations supported volume growth, especially in the fourth quarter. We have also started a Connect Campaign in Turkey in 2013, brand Coke features 200 most popular names on the both IC and HC packages. Connect promotion brought high advantage and significantly increased our brand equity scores in the marketplace. \r\nMoving on to international operations, in 2013, we continue to strengthen our market position in our key international markets. Pakistan sales volume was up 22%, driven by strong local marketing campaigns, cooler injections and increased our outlet penetrations. Brand Coke, Fanta and Sprite continue to grow double digits in 2013. In Pakistan, we have activated very successful Ramadan promotion with the help of 1.25-liter PET package. Iraq volume more than doubled in the back of inclusion of Al Waha and continued strong growth in Northern Iraq. In South Iraq, we have started Coke production in March of 2013 and initiated consumer activations in Baghdad as well. CCI maintained its #1 position in North Iraq and currently build in our outlet penetration in South. In 2013, our market share in Iraq in Sparkling was 26% in total. \r\nCentral Asia maintained its high growth trends and grew by 19%, thanks to growing economies, market share gains and improved execution. Our largest operation in Central Asia, Kazakhstan, grew by 24%, while all categories posted market share gains. Brand Coke grew 60%, hence, our sparkling market share in Kazakhstan posted strong 6.1% increase, reaching 48% in 2013. Fuse Tea sales growth was at high-single digits, posting share gain as well. \r\nNow I would like to turn the call to Orhun for an update on the financials. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Burak. And Good afternoon, and good morning, everyone. Before I start walking through our financial performance for 2013, as always, let us remember that between the 31st of December 2012 and 31st of December 2013, the Turkish lira has weakened some 19.7% against the dollar, whereas the average devaluation was about 6%, 6.2%. And again, the annual inflation on a year-on-year basis was 7.4% in the year. \r\nNow if you move over to the financial statements, that would be on Slide 11, the 2012 numbers you see here, as you would all remember by now, are pro forma numbers, whereas the Pakistani business is consolidated in full, so that's directly comparable to the numbers in 2013. I'm happy to again underline that we have delivered, in line with our guidance for 2013 and for the ones who have joined our call roughly a year ago when we were discussing our 2012 results and giving a guidance for 2013, we'll recall that we have done a little bit better in terms of how we have grown our EBITDA and extended our margin in the year. I think, this, as we have spoken throughout 2013, is a testament to CCI's strong business portfolio today, which roughly, in volume, revenue and a profitability perspective, is contributed roughly about 55% by our Turkish business and 45% by our International businesses. \r\nAs Burak was stating, our sales volume exceeded the 1 billion threshold, first time in 2013, whereas our net revenue has exceeded TL 5 billion, growing by about 17% on a consolidated basis versus 2012. If you look at 2013 in Turkey, the net sales grew by 5.6% over volume growth over just under 1% in the year, whereas the per unit case net sales revenue was up by about 4.7%. For some of our key packages, especially the larger packages like 2.5 liter or 1 liter, there has been price increases in line with the inflation. And again, as you would remember, as of the end of the 9 months for 2013, our average price in Turkey was up by about 7%. So higher than the inflation at the time, and pretty much in line with the annual inflation. Whereas in the last quarter of the year, due to the promotion campaigns that Burak was referring to, the net sales have come down by about 2%. However, we have been able to grow our volumes by about 2.1%. Now that was, I believe quite remarkable because that's coming on top of a contracting third quarter in the year, and rolling a very strong base of 12% growth coming from the last quarter of 2012. \r\nOutside of Turkey, though, the international revenue were up by about 26% for the whole year, and our International business has reached a revenue of about $1.2 billion, and in the last quarter, the growth was about 12.9%. Basically, that's a bit slower than the volume growth of 14% for the last quarter. \r\nNow the ones, again you would, I'm sure, remember our guidance for international where we were expecting softer average pricing, that was due to the inclusion of the South Iraq and 2013 was the first full year for the South Iraq business. So on an annual basis, we see our net sales per cases and dropping by about 1.2% on the international -- apologies, 4.2% for the international, that's primarily due to the inclusion of the South Iraq. In the last quarter, again, the unit cases were down by about 1.2%, and that's in reference to how our portfolio is taking shape because of a higher share of Pakistan and Iraq in the overall portfolio. However, if you look at 2013 as a whole, our consolidated net revenue per case was up by 3.2%. And as I have indicated, our overall revenues has grown close to 17% higher than our consolidated volume growth of about 13%. \r\nNow if you come to the profits, that's on Page 12, first of all, our gross profit has grown by 16.2%. That's slightly less than the revenue, but our gross profit margin were pretty much in line for all practical purposes at 37.8%. If you look at some of the details here, as we discussed, the raw material prices versus 2012 were pretty much in line or favorable throughout the year. In Turkey, the sugar prices were up by high-single digits. That's our expectation on a year-on-year basis, pretty much in line with the inflation. Apart from that, based on our strategic procurement initiatives, we have actually enjoyed a favorable pricing environment versus last year, which was somehow offset in Turkey by the FX movement for some of these items like resin and cans, which, on average at the end of the day in Turkey, made our gross profit margin flat versus last year at 41.9%. \r\nOn the international side though, again, due to lower sugar, resin and can prices, our gross profit margin was up to 32.6%. Now our strategic procurement initiatives we expect to continue in 2014. In fact, we have currently hedged about 98% close to full of our sugar requirements for 2014, that is exclusive of Turkey. We have actually fixed almost half of our aluminum needs for 2014, and we've hedged our positions financially. And for resin, which we can't hedge either financially or suppliers, we've prebought roughly half of our requirements for the year. So for 2014 as well, looking from today, we have quite a good visibility as far as our raw material prices are concerned. \r\nIf you look at our OpEx, our OpEx, on average, grew slower than our revenue base, although this is primarily driven by international, where we have been enjoying operating leverage and as far as the South Iraq business with the lower operating base, operating expense base is concerned, drives our average operating expenses on the international. And in Turkey, the operating expenses somehow grown a bit higher than the revenue that's primarily driven by sales distribution, and especially it was the second half of the year marketing and promotional expenses. \r\nIf you look at our EBITDA, our EBITDA consolidated EBITDA margin was up by some 8 -- 80 basis points to 17.2%. Basically, that's driven by Turkey's EBITDA growing by 10% and international EBITDA growing some 41%, thereby growing our consolidated EBITDA by 22%, again, resulting in a margin expansion for the year. If you look at our bottom line, we have recorded, as you will see on Page 13, noncash FX losses. If I can walk you through the structure of our financial expenses for the year, we have increased our interest income versus 2012. That's primarily driven by the amount of the cash that we were having at hand. As you will remember, we have finalized 2 transactions as Burak was referring to, one was the U.S. private placement transaction and the other one was the Eurobond. Although we have finalized these transactions, we have not yet closed some of the debt that is maturing this year in 2014 because of a favorable positive carry we have, which resulted in higher interest income we gained over higher average cash that we were holding. On the other hand, the interest expenses versus last year has also increased. That's due to the increased maturity of our debt portfolio from an average of 1.2 years, it's now increased to about 5 years at this point in time, which resulted on incremental higher interest expenses. The foreign exchange gains, the noncash gains that we have, that you see is a result of the hard currency denominated cash that we held at hand and the actually realized FX losses are at a minimum, that's the FX impact on the interest that we're paying. Whereas the unrealized FX losses that's driven by the especially the financial debt, that we carry in our balance sheet was over TL 300 million versus a TL 57 million gain last year resulted in a net financial expense of TL 257 million versus about a TL 5 million loss in 2012. So as a result, net income, if you were to decrease by 35% to some just under TL 250 million, and I'm presenting this by excluding the one-off income, that's an accounting income, that's coming out of the full consolidation of Pakistan for 2013, so our net income on a like-for-like basis versus last year decreased by some 35%. \r\nIf you look at the debt profile, that's on the next slide on 14, our gross debt from a base of $1,022,000,000 has increased to $1,446,000,000 at the end 2013, however, as I said, based on the amount of cash that we hold that's coming from Eurobond proceeds that we haven't utilized in  prefunding some of the upcoming maturities yet, so that increases both the cash and the debt numbers at the end of the year. So if we were to exclude that, our year-end financial debt would have been $1,012,000,000, slightly less than last year number, and the cash that we were holding should be about a little over $250 million. It doesn't have an impact on our net debt, which was about $750 million at the end of 2013 versus a $681 million at the end of 2012. However, if you look at the maturity looking from the end of 2013, there's quite a bit now, seem to be quite a bit maturing in 2014, although that amount is already available in cash. So if we were to look at it on an adjusted basis, only about 11% of our debt is actually maturing in 2014 and some 62% would be maturing in 2018, as we discussed the average of our debt has come to about 5 years, that's going -- most of them coming to 2018. \r\nAnd if you look at the composition of our debt, again, the majority is in dollars still, about 90% is in dollars, and 4% in euros. You will remember, when we discussed back in 2013, at the time before we were planning to do our Eurobond, we were thinking to utilize some Turkish lira instruments, potentially Euro TL instrument. There were transactions in the market at the time, but we've realized it was not a market, but more a window of opportunity. So going forward, we will see, if we can further capitalize on any window of opportunity that would enable us to increase the TL debt in our overall debt portfolio in CCI. And our net debt-to-EBITDA basis, our net-debt-to-EBITDA was 1.8x versus 1.7x in 2012 debt. Even though it's about a 20%, close to 20% devaluation of TL, so we can comfortably say I'm looking forward as well, we look to maintain our net-debt-to-EBITDA below 2x. \r\nIf you look at some of the other metrics that's impacting our cash flow, that's on Slide 15, on CapEx, as you remember, we guided about a 12% CapEx net sales revenue for 2013. And in fact, our spending was pretty much in-line, but we ended the year with some 13.5%. That's 150 basis points that's primarily attributable to the FX movement, so our spending was pretty much in-line with the guidance that we have given to yourselves. And it has increased versus 2012, because we have, as you will remember, doing some greenfield projects in Pakistan and in Kazakhstan, we're referring to what Burak was saying 2 markets where our volume growth was very strong, close or over 20% levels. So therefore, although we were planning to have a slightly positive free cash flow for 2013, we expedited some of these investments towards the end of 2013. So we ended the year with a minus TL 44 million, free cash flow. And the net working capital is pretty much in line, it was 12%, we ended up with 13%. That is again not to a great extent driven by how our receivables, payables or inventories moving. But as we have consolidated a larger TL equivalent of the international working capital due to the FX movement, that created a slight increase in our net working capital, but otherwise, our management to our working capital was intact and pretty much in line with the guidance that we have given you at that time. \r\nNow at this point in time, I'd like to turn over to Burak to share the outlook for the rest of the year and then we'll be happy to later take any questions about the financials again.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Orhun. Moving to our company guidance for 2014, we expect low-single digits volume growth in Turkey and mid-teens volume growth in international operations, resulting in high-single digits volume growth on a consolidated basis. We also expect net sales grow to ahead of our volume growth. We expect flat EBITDA margin due to current economic challenges, particularly around the volatile exchange rates. \r\nLast year, in the first quarter, as you know, Turkey, volume grew by 8%, so we have a tough comp ahead of us in the first quarter. However, we are pleased to see improvement volume trends in the beginning of the year. Moreover, international volume trend are in line with the expectations. We do not expect any major change in our input prices as Orhun mentioned. We expect our CapEx to net sales ratio to be around 13% for the 2014. A significant amount of the CapEx will be in our international operations. Finally, our net debt to EBITDA is expected to be lower than 2x for the 2014. \r\nSo now, we are available for any questions for the rest of the conference. Thank you.",

Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Nusret Köstem (Executives)】\nThank you, Burak. And Good afternoon, and good morning, everyone. Before I start walking through our financial performance for 2013, as always, let us remember that between the 31st of December 2012 and 31st of December 2013, the Turkish lira has weakened some 19.7% against the dollar, whereas the average devaluation was about 6%, 6.2%. And again, the annual inflation on a year-on-year basis was 7.4% in the year. \r\nNow if you move over to the financial statements, that would be on Slide 11, the 2012 numbers you see here, as you would all remember by now, are pro forma numbers, whereas the Pakistani business is consolidated in full, so that's directly comparable to the numbers in 2013.

If you look at 2013 in Turkey, the net sales grew by 5.6% over volume growth over just under 1% in the year, whereas the per unit case net sales revenue was up by about 4.7%. For some of our key packages, especially the larger packages like 2.5 liter or 1 liter, there has been price increases in line with the inflation. And again, as you would remember, as of the end of the 9 months for 2013, our average price in Turkey was up by about 7%. So higher than the inflation at the time, and pretty much in line with the annual inflation. Whereas in the last quarter of the year, due to the promotion campaigns that Burak was referring to, the net sales have come down by about 2%. However, we have been able to grow our volumes by about 2.1%. Now that was, I believe quite remarkable because that's coming on top of a contracting third quarter in the year, and rolling a very strong base of 12% growth coming from the last quarter of 2012. \r\nOutside of Turkey, though, the international revenue were up by about 26% for the whole year, and our International business has reached a revenue of about $1.2 billion, and in the last quarter, the growth was about 12.9%. Basically, that's a bit slower than the volume growth of 14% for the last quarter. \r\nNow the ones, again you would, I'm sure, remember our guidance for international where we were expecting softer average pricing, that was due to the inclusion of the South Iraq and 2013 was the first full year for the South Iraq business. So on an annual basis, we see our net sales per cases and dropping by about 1.2% on the international -- apologies, 4.2% for the international, that's primarily due to the inclusion of the South Iraq. In the last quarter, again, the unit cases were down by about 1.2%, and that's in reference to how our portfolio is taking shape because of a higher share of Pakistan and Iraq in the overall portfolio. However, if you look at 2013 as a whole, our consolidated net revenue per case was up by 3.2%. And as I have indicated, our overall revenues has grown close to 17% higher than our consolidated volume growth of about 13%. \r\nNow if you come to the profits, that's on Page 12, first of all, our gross profit has grown by 16.2%. That's slightly less than the revenue, but our gross profit margin were pretty much in line for all practical purposes at 37.8%. If you look at some of the details here, as we discussed, the raw material prices versus 2012 were pretty much in line or favorable throughout the year. In Turkey, the sugar prices were up by high-single digits. That's our expectation on a year-on-year basis, pretty much in line with the inflation. Apart from that, based on our strategic procurement initiatives, we have actually enjoyed a favorable pricing environment versus last year, which was somehow offset in Turkey by the FX movement for some of these items like resin and cans, which, on average at the end of the day in Turkey, made our gross profit margin flat versus last year at 41.9%. \r\nOn the international side though, again, due to lower sugar, resin and can prices, our gross profit margin was up to 32.6%. Now our strategic procurement initiatives we expect to continue in 2014. In fact, we have currently hedged about 98% close to full of our sugar requirements for 2014, that is exclusive of Turkey. We have actually fixed almost half of our aluminum needs for 2014, and we've hedged our positions financially. And for resin, which we can't hedge either financially or suppliers, we've prebought roughly half of our requirements for the year. So for 2014 as well, looking from today, we have quite a good visibility as far as our raw material prices are concerned. \r\nIf you look at our OpEx, our OpEx, on average, grew slower than our revenue base, although this is primarily driven by international, where we have been enjoying operating leverage and as far as the South Iraq business with the lower operating base, operating expense base is concerned, drives our average operating expenses on the international. And in Turkey, the operating expenses somehow grown a bit higher than the revenue that's primarily driven by sales distribution, and especially it was the second half of the year marketing and promotional expenses. \r\nIf you look at our EBITDA, our EBITDA consolidated EBITDA margin was up by some 8 -- 80 basis points to 17.2%. Basically, that's driven by Turkey's EBITDA growing by 10% and international EBITDA growing some 41%, thereby growing our consolidated EBITDA by 22%, again, resulting in a margin expansion for the year. If you look at our bottom line, we have recorded, as you will see on Page 13, noncash FX losses. If I can walk you through the structure of our financial expenses for the year, we have increased our interest income versus 2012. That's primarily driven by the amount of the cash that we were having at hand. As you will remember, we have finalized 2 transactions as Burak was referring to, one was the U.S. private placement transaction and the other one was the Eurobond. Although we have finalized these transactions, we have not yet closed some of the debt that is maturing this year in 2014 because of a favorable positive carry we have, which resulted in higher interest income we gained over higher average cash that we were holding. On the other hand, the interest expenses versus last year has also increased. That's due to the increased maturity of our debt portfolio from an average of 1.2 years, it's now increased to about 5 years at this point in time, which resulted on incremental higher interest expenses. The foreign exchange gains, the noncash gains that we have, that you see is a result of the hard currency denominated cash that we held at hand and the actually realized FX losses are at a minimum, that's the FX impact on the interest that we're paying. Whereas the unrealized FX losses that's driven by the especially the financial debt, that we carry in our balance sheet was over TL 300 million versus a TL 57 million gain last year resulted in a net financial expense of TL 257 million versus about a TL 5 million loss in 2012. So as a result, net income, if you were to decrease by 35% to some just under TL 250 million, and I'm presenting this by excluding the one-off income, that's an accounting income, that's coming out of the full consolidation of Pakistan for 2013, so our net income on a like-for-like basis versus last year decreased by some 35%. \r\nIf you look at the debt profile, that's on the next slide on 14, our gross debt from a base of $1,022,000,000 has increased to $1,446,000,000 at the end 2013, however, as I said, based on the amount of cash that we hold that's coming from Eurobond proceeds that we haven't utilized in  prefunding some of the upcoming maturities yet, so that increases both the cash and the debt numbers at the end of the year. So if we were to exclude that, our year-end financial debt would have been $1,012,000,000, slightly less than last year number, and the cash that we were holding should be about a little over $250 million. It doesn't have an impact on our net debt, which was about $750 million at the end of 2013 versus a $681 million at the end of 2012. However, if you look at the maturity looking from the end of 2013, there's quite a bit now, seem to be quite a bit maturing in 2014, although that amount is already available in cash. So if we were to look at it on an adjusted basis, only about 11% of our debt is actually maturing in 2014 and some 62% would be maturing in 2018, as we discussed the average of our debt has come to about 5 years, that's going -- most of them coming to 2018. \r\nAnd if you look at the composition of our debt, again, the majority is in dollars still, about 90% is in dollars, and 4% in euros. You will remember, when we discussed back in 2013, at the time before we were planning to do our Eurobond, we were thinking to utilize some Turkish lira instruments, potentially Euro TL instrument. There were transactions in the market at the time, but we've realized it was not a market, but more a window of opportunity. So going forward, we will see, if we can further capitalize on any window of opportunity that would enable us to increase the TL debt in our overall debt portfolio in CCI. And our net debt-to-EBITDA basis, our net-debt-to-EBITDA was 1.8x versus 1.7x in 2012 debt. Even though it's about a 20%, close to 20% devaluation of TL, so we can comfortably say I'm looking forward as well, we look to maintain our net-debt-to-EBITDA below 2x. \r\nIf you look at some of the other metrics that's impacting our cash flow, that's on Slide 15, on CapEx, as you remember, we guided about a 12% CapEx net sales revenue for 2013. And in fact, our spending was pretty much in-line, but we ended the year with some 13.5%. That's 150 basis points that's primarily attributable to the FX movement, so our spending was pretty much in-line with the guidance that we have given to yourselves. And it has increased versus 2012, because we have, as you will remember, doing some greenfield projects in Pakistan and in Kazakhstan, we're referring to what Burak was saying 2 markets where our volume growth was very strong, close or over 20% levels. So therefore, although we were planning to have a slightly positive free cash flow for 2013, we expedited some of these investments towards the end of 2013. So we ended the year with a minus TL 44 million, free cash flow. And the net working capital is pretty much in line, it was 12%, we ended up with 13%. That is again not to a great extent driven by how our receivables, payables or inventories moving. But as we have consolidated a larger TL equivalent of the international working capital due to the FX movement, that created a slight increase in our net working capital, but otherwise, our management to our working capital was intact and pretty much in line with the guidance that we have given you at that time. \r\nNow at this point in time, I'd like to turn over to Burak to share the outlook for the rest of the year and then we'll be happy to later take any questions about the financials again.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Burak Basarir (Executives)】\nThank you, Orhun. Moving to our company guidance for 2014, we expect low-single digits volume growth in Turkey and mid-teens volume growth in international operations, resulting in high-single digits volume growth on a consolidated basis. We also expect net sales grow to ahead of our volume growth. We expect flat EBITDA margin due to current economic challenges, particularly around the volatile exchange rates. \r\nLast year, in the first quarter, as you know, Turkey, volume grew by 8%, so we have a tough comp ahead of us in the first quarter. However, we are pleased to see improvement volume trends in the beginning of the year. Moreover, international volume trend are in line with the expectations. We do not expect any major change in our input prices as Orhun mentioned. We expect our CapEx to net sales ratio to be around 13% for the 2014. A significant amount of the CapEx will be in our international operations. Finally, our net debt to EBITDA is expected to be lower than 2x for the 2014. \r\nSo now, we are available for any questions for the rest of the conference. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text3": "Three questions from me, if I may. First of all, it looks like your revenue per case slipped in Q4 in Turkey given the increased promotions as you help stimulate demand on the net market. Could you comment on how revenue per case has evolved into 2014? And secondly, in Kazakhstan, I appreciate the Q1 is not a big season for soft drink sales, but can you comment on what impact you've seen so far in consumer sentiment following the Tenge devaluation in February? And then finally on your margin guidance a flat EBITDA margin in 2014, in your outlook statement, you talked about taking necessary mitigating steps across your geographies. Could you perhaps comment a little bit further on that?\n\n---\n\nEdward, thank you for the question. Let me start with the revenue per case on the Turkey front. What we have been seeing since the last quarter of 2012 was a little weaker volume on the consumer pull side. So the 2014 strategy started from, which started from the last quarter of 2013, was to increase our household penetration figures in Turkey. So that's why we have started new promotions to increase our household penetrations, which obviously impacted our net revenue per UC numbers. This year, 2014, we're expecting our net revenue per UC to in line with the inflation numbers. But our main goal is to grow the category of sparkling in Turkey and also increase our household penetration numbers. Regarding your second question around Kazakhstan, as you know, I mean, as you said, the first quarter, the first couple of months is pretty early right now, but we're planning to increase our prices in order to offset the Tenge devaluation. When we look at the year-to-date numbers, we're seeing good growth numbers in Kazakhstan. We haven't seen any negative pushback from the consumer demand side. So we're seeing positive numbers. But we need to see how will the second quarter and the third quarter will evolve, but I'm not seeing any major slippage in our volume growth numbers in Kazakhstan. On the margin front, we have taken a lot of the necessary steps to maintain our margin after the devaluation in Turkey. As you know, year-on-year it's about a little over 20% and 20% in Kazakhstan, and we've seen some kind of a devaluation impact on the Kyrgyzstan and some other Central Asian countries. So we're offsetting those currency devaluations through some price increases and then some OpEx management, and also the sum of the procurement initiatives that we have taken in the last years are helping us to offset some of those shortfalls. So that's why we're guiding a flat margin for 2014.\n\n---\n\nIf I can just get back to the first question. So you're planning to take on revenue per case in Turkey and Lehman inflation so sort of high-single digits. As you increase your household penetration figures, what does that mean for your strategy to push in a more favorable packs, more favorable channels and sparking over still, you've been successful with the last couple of years?\n\n---\n\nEdward, if you -- when you look at the Turkey in terms of the package mix, you understand, I see mix in our total portfolio is around 18%. So when you look at the most -- more developed markets, this number goes up to 30% or so. So we still have clear room for improvement on our IC mix. And when you look at the channel mix in terms of the home market, organize trades and on-premise channel, we still have a lot of room to grow, our immediate consumption channel mix in our total portfolio. So we have a lot to do on that too. The soda strategy will be to increase the household penetration numbers through some consumer promotions. As you would remember, we have missed Ramadan promotion last year. I mean that was a conscious decision from our part, but this year, we are going to doing that Ramadan promotion for the consumers. But at the same time, we are taking a lot of initiatives to improve our IC mix and also to -- we've taken a lot of a lot of initiatives to improve our sales mix in the on-premise channels. So those will help us to improve our net revenue per case, almost in line with the inflation number.\n\n---\n\nI have a follow-up question. My question is regarding -- you mentioned recovery in volumes in the first quarter of 2014 for the local market, Turkish market. I just wondered, the composition of the profitability, do we -- do you expect flat margins for Turkish operations and international operations or the composition will change? As far as I understand, you are still promoting Turkish products and in the international operations, you are making price adjustments. Can you give us more color on that front?\n\n---\n\nTo be honest with you, I would be more prudent on the Turkish front, so I would guide you have an flattish margin on the Turkey business, because of the things I talked about. So we want to grow the categories, so we're going to be increasing our activations at the consumer level. So I would assume that flattish margin in Turkish operation. But if the things go as it is in the international market, I would have assumed a little bit of a margin improvement on the international front. So the consolidated should be around flat. So I don't want to overpromise anything. Turkey, flattish, international operations being a little stronger on the margin front.\n\n---\n\nAnd if I may just add to that, Kenan, given -- back to Burak's earlier point, given that we have quite a strong first half in 2013, we will be rolling a very strong base in Turkey in the first half of the year. So therefore, I think the progress would be more incremental in the first half. Although we started the year again quite well. Hopefully, the international will continue with the momentum. But I think we get to the third quarter, whereas we can say that maybe an opportunity given now the softer base in Turkey last year, I think we will maintain a more conservative outlook in terms of margins given the uncertainty. But again, into the year, coming back to Burak's point, we'll be happy to revisit our guidance if we see any changes to our expectations.\n\n---\n\nA couple of questions from me, if I may. Firstly, on your interest line, you talked a lot about this and the changes that have come through in 2013, and if my numbers are correct, I think net interest, excluding the FX impact went from minus TL 22 in 2012 to minus TL 54 in 2013. What upside do you see to that number as you continue refinancing through 2014 given that everything you did in 2013 and the continual paydown that you're going to do? I guess you have quite a lot of visibility around your interest charge through 2014. So that's the first question.\n\n---\n\nOkay, Nick, this is Orhun speaking. Let me quickly answer that. You're right, our net interest expense, I was trying to -- it has increased. And I think that relatively increased rates would be there to stay because if you remember for most of 2013 and earlier, our average cost of indebtedness was LIBOR plus 200, 210 basis points. So essentially, we've replaced it with a maturity of an average of 1.2 years. So we replaced it with debt with a maturity of 5 years, but a average, let's say, cost of indebtedness is somewhere between 4% and 4.5%, maybe 4.30%, basically. So that increase is here to stay and that's what we should expect going forward. Now I think that's the majority of the debt anyway, And that's so longer-term debt. So anything that's coming and going in between will have a limited impact on the average cost of indebtedness, but these levels we should expect to see going forward.\n\n---\n\nBut you still have -- just to be clear, you still have some of that to work its way through into the 2014 numbers, because we're not seeing everything in 2013, is that right?\n\n---\n\nSure, sure, that's what I'm saying. That's why I'm referring to you not the amount that we pay, but the percent of interest that we are going to pay. So that would be -- at least there should be about that means 250 to 300 basis points increase, that's because of the nature of the -- changing nature of the debt in our balance sheet.\n\n---\n\nOkay, and then secondly, just a hop back to the operations in -- well based in Turkey and in Kazakhstan year-to-date, and I just want to be absolutely clear on this. You talked about in both countries seeing price adjustments with inflation in Turkey and then to cover the devaluation in Kazakhstan. Have you actually put price increases through yet or are you seeing the good start of the year, the volume increases year-to-date without having put price increases through yet?\n\n---\n\nNick, this is Burak. We haven't put any price increases in place yet. But we will pretty soon in Kazakhstan. We have increased juice prices in Kazakhstan just recently. But if you look at the year-to-date volume growth numbers, they are phenomenal, that I can tell you. But we will be increasing our prices because of 20% devaluation in Tenge. You cannot live without having the price increases, we will do that. In Turkey, we haven't planned any price increases and we will probably not do any price increases until after the first half. So we want to see the volume uptick from the consumers, and we want to understand our promotions effectiveness at the consumer level. But if you see any necessity, we can increase our prices at any time. So in terms of year-to-date volume performance, we're pretty happy with what we're seeing. We're in line with plans in Turkey and we're ahead of our plans in Central Asia. And then we will do any necessary price adjustments when we see necessary going forward in Kazakhstan and in Turkey.\n\n---\n\nAnd just in general, with the Turkish consumer, how are you seeing -- have you seen much change as we've gone through the course of the year so far?\n\n---\n\nTo be honest with you, no. I mean, I would have expected a deeper deterioration on the consumer sentiment, but we haven't. As I've said, I'm pretty happy with the Turkish performance in terms of volume numbers. So that gives me confidence that our initiatives and our plans are working. So that's why we haven't decided -- we have decided not to increase our prices in the first couple of months, and then we will wait until the end of first half and decide accordingly.\n\n---\n\nMy questions -- I have 2 questions for you. First one regarding the margin, so that -- maybe I missed it, but you said the flat -- you are guiding flat EBITDA margin for all operation, but then I got the idea that TR margin, you expect Turkish margin to be flat going forward. But you are increasing the prices in the first half and there are also cost pressures. The Costs, should we look at it like what I understand, international margins are going much better. So it's a going to make up for the loss in Turkey, but you're seeing something else, I think. Should we expect mix change to make up for all these loss? And I have another question.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Alan. [ph] Now first of all, going back to Burak's point earlier, on the international side, we expect the momentum to continue, meaning that we can expect to see margin expansion with a mid-teens volume growth. That's more or less what we expect to see. In Turkey, at this point in time, we want to be a bit more conservative because at least, as we're trying to explain in the first half of the year, we'd be rolling a very strong base and given the uncertainty in the market, we don't necessarily make plans to immediately push through price increases, but reserve them for the second half of the year. So we are, at this point in time, taking a conservative approach, and looking at maybe flattish margins at best. But on a consolidated level, we should at least expect a flat EBITDA margin profile. Now at the same time, given that we have a soft third quarter to roll from 2013 base, there may be potentially upside risk to what we're seeing. But until we see how the year evolves, that's a bit early for us to make aggressive guidance or judgments on that, we will maintain a flat EBITDA margin outlook, but again, happy to revisit that on a going forward basis. Now as far as the cost pressure is concerned, because that's I think is something that you have been referring to, now as I said, we have pretty much visibility on the prices of the raw materials at this point in time. So basically, we know more or less what those prices is going to be. Now the precautions we are going to take is, for example, any more, let's say FX volatility significantly above what we see today. But that's what we're saying, we're taking a more conservative approach at least for the first half in Turkey. And reserve any, let's say, price adjustments primarily for the second half of the year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I have another question about the working capital need. Burak, should we expect a decline going forward like or are these levels -- could you elaborate on that?\n\n---\n\nSure, normally, yes, I mean, our net working capital as a percent of net sales revenue was about somewhere between 14% to 15%, that was back in 2009 and 2010 where we started gradually to decrease that by about 12% level in 2012. Now in 2013, it was 13%. But the reason it was 13% was because we have roughly half of the contribution of the international roughly half of the overall. And we consolidated it from a higher base because of the FX movements. So there's a, let's say, unnatural impact coming from the networking capital. If you look at the components, meaning the receivables, the inventories and payables, normally 12% is what we should expect to continue delivering. But when the Turkish lira weakens against the dollar, we have a stronger International business, which creates a higher working capital contribution. That's the impact we see over and above the 12% average that we expect to see going forward.\n\n---\n\nJust 2 quick questions on the debt, you have $548 million due in 2014, out of which I think 4 35 -- $435 million you would -- you have -- you will be paying off from the bond issue. What about the other 100 -- $100 and change million? And the second question is with the new Eurobond, what's the average cost of debt for the company now?\n\n---\n\nThank you, this is Orhun speaking. The balance is actually, the 435 million that we require to pay back in 2014, because we have paid some of it when we did the USPP back in May. So that's the amount that we need to repay. There's some bit that's primarily the debt that we carry in Pakistan, but that's a smaller amount that we need to consider in the second half of the year, but we don't have to necessarily look at its -- for a long-term funding perspective. And that's the 11% that I was referring to that's maturing, especially in the second half of the year. And the cost of debt, as I was saying, we increased it from an average of LIBOR plus 210 basis points with an average maturity of 1.2 years, to about maybe 4.3% fixed with a maturity of roughly 5 years. And that's what we should expect on a dollar basis, the cost of funding is going to be.\n\n---\n\nJust one follow-up question on the debt, you mentioned that you would be looking for ways of increasing the lira portion of your debt. Do you have a idea or ballpark figure of how much could you achieve, say within 1 or 2 years?\n\n---\n\nWell, I mean, it's -- well, the mathematics would go like this: We have ab -- let's say, average cost of funding for about somewhere between 10% to 11% over the course of past 5 years, including the devaluation. That's not only the interest that we're paying on the debt, but also the impact of the devaluation as well. Now when we want to include the Turkish lira component, we would want to make sure that our cost of indebtedness, again, including the devaluation should not include very significant. So that proportion is a matter of mathematics, making sure that we would not necessarily significantly exceed, and what I mean is that, today, probably in any Turkish lira that we want to switch, will not be less than this 11% to 12% into the portfolio. So we would be very careful in doing so because just for a reminders part of -- although we'll be paying some 4.5% on the dollar debt, the rest would be coming from any potential devaluation which has a noncash impact. And including more Turkish lira debt in the portfolio means that we are going to pay that in cash as interest. So that's why we want to make sure we maintain a blend that would not necessarily and significantly increase our average cost of indebtedness. That, I can -- I'm not able to tell you exactly what it could be today, but I would assume maybe at around 50%, give or take. But that's -- the number is not a predetermined number. It would be based on the average cost of indebtedness that we would be looking at.\n\n---\n\nWell, thank you. Before closing, I would like to remind you a few important near-term strategic pillars of our growth. We will be focusing on energizing sparkling growth and continue to improve our immediate consumption business to support profitable growth and increase per capita consumptions in Turkey. We will accelerate revenue and margin growth is international operations, particularly in Iraq and Pakistan. We believe CCI has an unmatched growth story in the frontier markets and growth potential in Turkey. Furthermore, its more balanced portfolio with increasing share of our international operations help the balance sheet, all now making CCI more attractive than ever. \r\nThank you, all, for your participation in the call. I wish you all a wonderful day. Thank you.",

We haven't put any price increases in place yet. But we will pretty soon in Kazakhstan. We have increased juice prices in Kazakhstan just recently. But if you look at the year-to-date volume growth numbers, they are phenomenal, that I can tell you. But we will be increasing our prices because of 20% devaluation in Tenge. You cannot live without having the price increases, we will do that. In Turkey, we haven't planned any price increases and we will probably not do any price increases until after the first half. So we want to see the volume uptick from the consumers, and we want to understand our promotions effectiveness at the consumer level. But if you see any necessity, we can increase our prices at any time. So in terms of year-to-date volume performance, we're pretty happy with what we're seeing. We're in line with plans in Turkey and we're ahead of our plans in Central Asia. And then we will do any necessary price adjustments when we see necessary going forward in Kazakhstan and in Turkey.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nicholas Ashworth (Analysts)】\nAnd just in general, with the Turkish consumer, how are you seeing -- have you seen much change as we've gone through the course of the year so far?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Burak Basarir (Executives)】\nTo be honest with you, no. I mean, I would have expected a deeper deterioration on the consumer sentiment, but we haven't. As I've said, I'm pretty happy with the Turkish performance in terms of volume numbers. So that gives me confidence that our initiatives and our plans are working. So that's why we haven't decided -- we have decided not to increase our prices in the first couple of months, and then we will wait until the end of first half and decide accordingly.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nMy questions -- I have 2 questions for you. First one regarding the margin, so that -- maybe I missed it, but you said the flat -- you are guiding flat EBITDA margin for all operation, but then I got the idea that TR margin, you expect Turkish margin to be flat going forward. But you are increasing the prices in the first half and there are also cost pressures. The Costs, should we look at it like what I understand, international margins are going much better. So it's a going to make up for the loss in Turkey, but you're seeing something else, I think. Should we expect mix change to make up for all these loss? And I have another question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nusret Köstem (Executives)】\nThank you, Alan. [ph] Now first of all, going back to Burak's point earlier, on the international side, we expect the momentum to continue, meaning that we can expect to see margin expansion with a mid-teens volume growth. That's more or less what we expect to see. In Turkey, at this point in time, we want to be a bit more conservative because at least, as we're trying to explain in the first half of the year, we'd be rolling a very strong base and given the uncertainty in the market, we don't necessarily make plans to immediately push through price increases, but reserve them for the second half of the year. So we are, at this point in time, taking a conservative approach, and looking at maybe flattish margins at best. But on a consolidated level, we should at least expect a flat EBITDA margin profile. Now at the same time, given that we have a soft third quarter to roll from 2013 base, there may be potentially upside risk to what we're seeing. But until we see how the year evolves, that's a bit early for us to make aggressive guidance or judgments on that, we will maintain a flat EBITDA margin outlook, but again, happy to revisit that on a going forward basis. Now as far as the cost pressure is concerned, because that's I think is something that you have been referring to, now as I said, we have pretty much visibility on the prices of the raw materials at this point in time. So basically, we know more or less what those prices is going to be. Now the precautions we are going to take is, for example, any more, let's say FX volatility significantly above what we see today. But that's what we're saying, we're taking a more conservative approach at least for the first half in Turkey. And reserve any, let's say, price adjustments primarily for the second half of the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nOkay. I have another question about the working capital need. Burak, should we expect a decline going forward like or are these levels -- could you elaborate on that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Burak Basarir (Executives)】\nSure, normally, yes, I mean, our net working capital as a percent of net sales revenue was about somewhere between 14% to 15%, that was back in 2009 and 2010 where we started gradually to decrease that by about 12% level in 2012. Now in 2013, it was 13%. But the reason it was 13% was because we have roughly half of the contribution of the international roughly half of the overall. And we consolidated it from a higher base because of the FX movements. So there's a, let's say, unnatural impact coming from the networking capital. If you look at the components, meaning the receivables, the inventories and payables, normally 12% is what we should expect to continue delivering. But when the Turkish lira weakens against the dollar, we have a stronger International business, which creates a higher working capital contribution. That's the impact we see over and above the 12% average that we expect to see going forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Klim Fedoff (Analysts)】\nJust 2 quick questions on the debt, you have $548 million due in 2014, out of which I think 4 35 -- $435 million you would -- you have -- you will be paying off from the bond issue. What about the other 100 -- $100 and change million? And the second question is with the new Eurobond, what's the average cost of debt for the company now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nusret Köstem (Executives)】\nThank you, this is Orhun speaking. The balance is actually, the 435 million that we require to pay back in 2014, because we have paid some of it when we did the USPP back in May. So that's the amount that we need to repay. There's some bit that's primarily the debt that we carry in Pakistan, but that's a smaller amount that we need to consider in the second half of the year, but we don't have to necessarily look at its -- for a long-term funding perspective. And that's the 11% that I was referring to that's maturing, especially in the second half of the year. And the cost of debt, as I was saying, we increased it from an average of LIBOR plus 210 basis points with an average maturity of 1.2 years, to about maybe 4.3% fixed with a maturity of roughly 5 years. And that's what we should expect on a dollar basis, the cost of funding is going to be.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Erik Hegedus (Analysts)】\nJust one follow-up question on the debt, you mentioned that you would be looking for ways of increasing the lira portion of your debt. Do you have a idea or ballpark figure of how much could you achieve, say within 1 or 2 years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Burak Basarir (Executives)】\nWell, I mean, it's -- well, the mathematics would go like this: We have ab -- let's say, average cost of funding for about somewhere between 10% to 11% over the course of past 5 years, including the devaluation. That's not only the interest that we're paying on the debt, but also the impact of the devaluation as well. Now when we want to include the Turkish lira component, we would want to make sure that our cost of indebtedness, again, including the devaluation should not include very significant. So that proportion is a matter of mathematics, making sure that we would not necessarily significantly exceed, and what I mean is that, today, probably in any Turkish lira that we want to switch, will not be less than this 11% to 12% into the portfolio. So we would be very careful in doing so because just for a reminders part of -- although we'll be paying some 4.5% on the dollar debt, the rest would be coming from any potential devaluation which has a noncash impact. And including more Turkish lira debt in the portfolio means that we are going to pay that in cash as interest. So that's why we want to make sure we maintain a blend that would not necessarily and significantly increase our average cost of indebtedness. That, I can -- I'm not able to tell you exactly what it could be today, but I would assume maybe at around 50%, give or take. But that's -- the number is not a predetermined number. It would be based on the average cost of indebtedness that we would be looking at.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Burak Basarir (Executives)】\nWell, thank you. Before closing, I would like to remind you a few important near-term strategic pillars of our growth. We will be focusing on energizing sparkling growth and continue to improve our immediate consumption business to support profitable growth and increase per capita consumptions in Turkey. We will accelerate revenue and margin growth is international operations, particularly in Iraq and Pakistan. We believe CCI has an unmatched growth story in the frontier markets and growth potential in Turkey. Furthermore, its more balanced portfolio with increasing share of our international operations help the balance sheet, all now making CCI more attractive than ever. \r\nThank you, all, for your participation in the call. I wish you all a wonderful day. Thank you.",

      "transcript_text1": "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of the Investment Analysts Society, we would like to thank Sanlam at the outset for hosting us here today in the presentation for the results of the year ended December 2013. The director [ph] from sales, the executives, members of the board, we thank you. \r\nSanlam has its origins almost 100 years old. I don't want to preempt anything about what happens in 2018, but it was formed in 1918. It was incorporated as an enterprise to mobilize investment savings in South Africa through various investment products. This company has done that over the years and particularly in the formative years in the '30s through to the '70s when it formed closed investment trusts as a medium of investment. And in those trusts, it invested in small enterprises. And over the years, those small enterprises are today major enterprises in South Africa. Many of them are listed. Some of the market capitalizations today far exceeding that of Sanlam. Sanlam's market capitalization takes it into the top 50 companies in South Africa. But there are many ahead, and there are many unlisted companies and there are many below that owe their origins of capital and investment to Sanlam. \r\nSanlam has always been a company that's been on the forefront of investment enterprise in South Africa no more so than today, as it embraces a new social and economic order. And so it's with great interest today that we thank you not only for inviting us, but to share in the results of what has been achieved over the past 12 months, and gain insight as to where this company is going to in the future and playing such a vital part in the enterprise of -- for all South Africans. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThank you so much for that introduction, and the advertisement as well. Ladies and gentlemen, it's a pleasure to welcome you all here at the -- our annual results presentation on 2013. Before I really start, I would like to welcome a few special guests, some of our board members here: our Chairman, Desmond Smith; other board members, Philip Rademeyer; Rejoice Simelane; Bernard Swanepoel; a few staff members here from the EXCO, Temba Mvusi; Tema Gametsi [ph]; and so. And people who'll join me in answering questions and doing part of the presentation here: Kobus Möller, our Financial Director; and Andre Zeeman, our Chief Actuary and also Chief Risk Officer. We would like to also welcome some of our other partners here: the FSB, our regulator; SARS, our big partner; and some business people here from our businesses, welcome. \r\nLadies and gentlemen, our presentation as usual will focus a bit on the operating environment, which I'll cover, to set the scene for the results. I think the results are meaningless without taking into account what we had to deal with. And then I'll give you a strategic overview of the business, some of the main results and where we're heading. Kobus Möller, our Financial Director, will talk a little bit about the financials, give you the actual results and the feedback. And I'll end off with the outlook and priorities that we have for this year, things that we'll be tackling, and our vision for the future. Then there will be some question time and Andre Zeeman, our Chief Actuary, will also join us because I'm sure some of those questions will be fairly technical in nature. \r\nStarting off with the operating environment. I have to, from the outset, say it's been a tough year. It is -- the fundamentals remain uncertain and increasingly, there is no predictability. If we really look at the operating environment, the conditions were quite challenging, slow global recovery. But I must say signs of improvement, but it's not necessarily all well and particularly Europe is still struggling. Some of the big news with respect to the Emerging Markets of which we're  [ph] one [ph] is the tapering of the quantitative easing that is impacting negatively on emerging markets. And we felt it ourselves, but a big part of our focus is also Emerging Markets, and we have to reexamine on how we're going to roll out our strategy there. We've also seen the low short-term interest rate environment in 2013, and while we've seen some uptick in interest rates this year, in 2013, the short-term rates were still low. And in particular, we've seen a very weak short-term insurance claim cycle. And our big business there, Santam, actually felt that. And I'll talk a bit later about that as well. \r\nIn South Africa, I'll show you a few slides on the growth, which is low. The interest rates that -- particularly, the long rates having [ph]  Gone up quite a bit. The equity market, that's been very kind to us, and then the currency, that has been weakening, but has been positive for our international businesses and the contribution. And increasingly, we'll also have to talk about Africa and India because they are also forming a bigger part of our business. So I'll show you a few slides on that. \r\nIf we look at the South African economy, I think the overriding factor is the low growth level. Throughout the year in 2013, it's been lowering, the growth expectation, and we now know that it's just around 2%. I think that hides a big part of the positives that we see. Within that low growth rate, there has been a massive redistribution of wealth and a big number of new entrants into the market. If we take the period 2006 to 2012 for which we have data, we've seen a very large number of people becoming part of the mainstream economy, people who have been excluded in the past. And of course, they're underinsured, and in the lower end of the South African market, the entry level, it creates a real opportunity. So despite a difficult period, which we expect to continue for a while, in spite of elections and things like that, where you would expect stimulus and things like that, it is still a tough area. The big focus on opportunity mainly comes from a higher number of people rather than the economy turning around. \r\nIf you look at the interest rates, you can see from the short-term rate is still being relatively low. But the big move that we've seen from the end of last year until now is really the 9-year sort of bond yield, bond rate that went up quite substantially, around 140 basis points. And that will have real negative impacts on our return on group embedded value and the value of new business growth because that is a critical part in the discount factor that we utilize in a big part of our business in the middle market, where we still play a dominant role. So overall, a higher rate means a higher discount rate, lower present value, that is essentially what it is about there. We've seen that thing tick up quite a bit. \r\nThe big story really and a big part for the positive results that we'll be talking about just now has been the SA equity market. You'll see the bond market didn't perform well at all in the past year, in fact, in the -- over the year, only yielded 0.6%. But the equity market did around 18%. And this, I think the key part of that, it's not only that it grew, but it grew off already a high base that was substantially higher than the previous year. So our businesses involved in asset gathering and where people paid fees on the investments really did well. So it was a positive across the board for us. It was offset a little bit by the weak bond market performance. But overall, a positive effect. \r\nThe weakening in the average exchange rate for the rand benefited our non-South African earnings, but it also put pressure on our earnings in South Africa through inflationary effects, and particularly a business like Santam struggled with dealing with the quick drop in the rand where you cannot raise the premiums quickly enough, particularly in the motor business, to adjust for price increases in parts. But you can see against the developed markets around 20% -- between 15% and 20% decrease, so our businesses there did well. And then in Botswana, India, and Rest of Africa, our major component in the Emerging Markets, changes between sort of 5% and 10%. So overall, we benefited from this strength and that contributed to around ZAR 150 million or so positive to our earnings overall. \r\nIf we look at the businesses in Africa and the economy there, in Botswana in particular, which is a big part of our business, the consumer remains under pressure. We have to do a lot of business in the civil service, they haven't had inflationary-type increases in salaries there for quite a while, so they're falling behind. And that put, of course the customers and the clients there under pressure. In the Rest of Africa, we see a low demand for resources, still [ph] resource-driven economies, apart from oil. But overall, the growth remains higher than in South Africa and we're still feeling positive that we're doing the right stuff over there. \r\nIn India, we've seen below-trend economic growth during the last year, but the growth is still just around 5% to 6%, which is substantially higher than elsewhere. And at this growth level, we still add big numbers of people to the middle market, which we're focusing on. And so overall, we're quite positive and bullish -- not necessarily about the overall Indian economy, but what is happening in the market segment that we're targeting. We think there is substantial scope, and we've seen growth rates that we're very proud of. So inflation is relatively high. We also see high-rising interest rates there. But overall, it is benefiting us, and the currency volatility is very similar to that of South Africa. \r\nWithin this environment, our results and how we performed. Firstly, our strategy, still focusing on returns. For us, the return measure is much more important than size or any other metric. We have a big focus on growth trying to add value, and we're growing the profitability through getting new business, through getting diversification to make that growth more robust, but also through cutting costs and making sure that the efficiencies that we run at are really low in terms of low cost-producing businesses. And I think in particular, in the cost management, we've done well in the past year. Although you will see the business flow has also increased quite nicely and so forth. \r\nThe other big part that we're focusing on is capital efficiency. This has been a central theme, optimal application of capital, chasing surplus capital out, lazy capital out, make it discretionary, applying it if we find things, paying special dividends and returning to shareholders if we don't use it. Last year, we did return some. This year, we only pay a normal dividend because we think we have a pipeline of products that may use most of the surplus at the kind of rates and returns that we would like to have. But if you look back at the past 10 years, these 2 key strategies, we think, added around 50% each of the value. About half the value in the Sanlam share that we've seen -- or the increase in value in the last 10 years -- has come from the growth part of it, and around half of it is because of managing the capital substantially better. Of course, there's also an interaction between these 2 as this slide shows you. \r\nThe big part of our businesses is still South Africa. It's fairly mature. It's stable. It gives quite nice cash. It delivers a lot of cash. And the key here is maximizing returns, efficient and effective management of what we have, and then utilizing the surplus cash through paying dividends and so forth. But what we have over and above that, reapplying it through effective capital management in what we believe is the new growth opportunities, the high-yielding areas into Africa, Southeast Asia and some niche areas that we've seen in the asset management industry in the developed world. So it's been a key part of what we're driving, and I think for the first year, this year, we can really see that strategy coming through to the fore, with particularly the international platform into the emerging markets that we're setting up for the future, giving us a really nice kick in terms of profitability and so forth. And if you really look at what's been earned in earnings per share and so forth, you see the net operating profit per share increased by 34%, which we believe is a very credible number given the environment that we're in.  \r\nGranted a lot of that was acquisitive growth, businesses that we bought, Shriram, P&O in Malaysia, 1 or 2 businesses in Africa that we acquired. And if we strip that out, the growth through organic, and the organic growth was in the order of about 25%, 26%, which we think is excellent. \r\nNormalized headline earnings per share up 25%, also a very nice number, on the back of investment markets also helping quite a bit. If we look at business volumes, new business volumes increased 36%. Net fund flows up substantially. Net life value of new business up 12%. The flows were quite nicely up but because we're using higher discount rates, it impacted on that negatively in spite of volumes being higher. The net value of new business margin improved on a constant discount rate, fairly flat. If we use the higher rate Group Equity Value, which is really a measure of the intrinsic value of Sanlam for ZAR 4 121 cents per share and a return on group embedded value per share of roughly 17%, which gives you an ROE of 23%, 24%. It's a bit of a meaningless number in our own case, but it is a substantial number and often people would like to compare that with banks. \r\nSo if you really look at the profitable growth, you can see our value of new business on the Life side increasing substantially, the sources of that where it is coming from, and you see also the effect. The margin is the gray line. On the slide there, you can see that coming slightly down, mainly through the effect of the higher discount rate. As I've said, on the entry-level market, we use the 5-year bond rate, that is -- went up by about 150 basis points from the previous year. And in the middle market and higher end of the market, we now use the 9-year bond rate, which went up around 140 basis points. But if you do that, you'll get the numbers. But overall, the business has been growing something that is very satisfactory. \r\nIf we look at persistency, you can see the numbers there in the middle market. You can also see, towards the end there, the ticking up of lapses, surrenders and so. Partly, it's because the regulatory framework makes it easier for people to shift money away and move it between different players. The second part why we see the tick up is because of the tough economic environment. Now the important thing there is it is well within our assumption base. We're performing well within the assumption base, and we still make persistency profits like you'll see on the -- in terms of what we'll have. And later on Kobus will take you through that. In this graph, you can see when the people lost their jobs in 2008 because of the crisis that we've had across the world in 2007, where 1 million people lost their jobs in South Africa, a mild tick-up, I think less so than our peers, where persistency went south a little bit. We managed to bring it down, but you can see the increasing pressure in the economy. Now for the first time since then, really picking up a little bit, as -- but as I've said, well within our assumption base, and similarly, in the lower end of the market. While we're trying to focus on people who are not indebted, we've really set ourselves up and so forth. Things like the strikes, in particular the platinum area, have been hurting us. \r\nA big part of our business, in fact, in Sanlam Sky, Rustenburg, the Rustenburg branch is by far our biggest and most productive branch. And when you have a lot of strikes over there, those people simply don't earn income, and you'd expect persistency to weaken and you can see that. Again, we're well within our assumption base, and we don't think there's a problem, but we wouldn't like these industrial actions to go on for too long. So we have a big stake riding on that. \r\nOkay. If you look at our investment performance, I think I have to give credit to our -- the team there. If you look at on -- whether you look on a 3-year basis or on a 5-year basis, we have over 90% of the money that we manage -- in this case, well over ZAR 300 billion within SIM -- making the benchmark that we've set for ourselves. We work mainly with fixed benchmarks being an insurer. We would like to get to certain targets. We're not that good when we run in an open race against everybody else, but where we have a fixed target in retirement, and particularly within an insurance company, you would expect us to do well and we've done that. So overall, whichever period you look at, it's been going very well and you can see the up-tick there. \r\nWe -- long-term value investors, we call it pragmatic value because we make assumptions there. And you can really see the strategy doing well for us over a period of time. On experience variances, we've had an exceptional year. For the first time in our history, we've had experience variances, positive experience variances of over ZAR 1 billion. And it's a key part. It surprised us with how big it was -- or it is -- and we don't necessarily expect this to continue because if we expected it to continue, it would have to be capitalized. The source of these experience variances come from several different strategies, which vary a bit from year-to-year. But it also shows the prudence, the consistency and that nothing has changed in the way that we look at the business. \r\nIf we look at the diversification of the base, on the left hand, if you really look at our Group Equity Value, you'll see we are about -- 7, 8 years ago, life insurance used to be half of our business -- 80% of our business. It's roughly half of our business now with other kinds of businesses, short-term insurance, investment management, credit and banking, admin and so forth being the other half. And if you look at the net operating profit, you can see the contribution over there. The life business had really -- came to the party well. The asset management, I think, did particularly well in the past year. Credit banking, particularly Sanlam Capital Markets, did particularly well. Short-term insurance, under pressure. While we have 70% of our assets in there or of our investments, they only contributed 7%. And initially, we thought it's a bad performance. But as more and more of the -- our peers and competitors announced their results, we were feeling much better about what -- how we performed over there. So overall, that the Santam did fairly well. \r\nIf you also look at our footprint, increasingly, you know it's in Africa, Southeast Asia, English-speaking regulatory environment that we understand, where we can make contributions. We have a team from South Africa contributing and interacting in a partnership model outside of South Africa. So overall, it's working and the contribution from our businesses outside of South Africa has been tremendous. While we have 20% of our money invested in our international businesses in terms of our value, our equity value, it contributed 27% of our profits. So it's a sizable number. We haven't made big bets. We've been very cautious about it, and we're pretty proud of the performance there. The return on the group embedded value in our international businesses has been mid-30%. If you take the effects of the markets out on the operational level and so forth, it's been 26%. It's been a very good story for us up till now. And we'd like to strengthen our relationships there and do a bit more. \r\nIf you really look at the growth of the business, this diversification story: 10 years ago, 98% South African business, the bulk of it in life insurance. We were able to grow the pie quite substantially, and you can see there on the right-hand side, just in the past 2 years, on how we've been able to evolve the strategy, different sources of income. And with about 1/3 of it coming from nontraditional areas, places where we and businesses that we were not in 5 years ago, that is really treating us very well because the returns are high and the growth rates are substantially high. So overall, I think a pleasing picture. \r\nAnd if we'll just look, a bit of a forward-looking area. If we look at the life insurance space, South Africa, where we were, 2003 to where we are now, about half of it coming from the traditional areas and half of it coming from new areas. And this is how the book will look a few years from now when we see things mature a little bit. So overall, strategy has been in place for a while and it's starting to deliver results. I think we're pretty pleased about what's been happening there. \r\nBefore we come to the results, 1 or 2 remarks on capital. As you know, we're in the process of implementing the Solvency II regime in South Africa, the one that we call SAM over here, we're taking a fairly prudent approach on the capital while we're awaiting the final SAM specifications. 1 or 2 areas of uncertainty. We hope that there will be more certainty and clarity towards the end of the year, which means that we'll be able to move forward on the capital story. For the moment, we think we are well capitalized and we're not going to change the model substantially until we know exactly where we're heading with the new SAM regime. \r\nWe spent about ZAR 2.5 billion in new investments in growth markets finalized in 2013. We paid around ZAR 1 billion of special dividends last year, which accounted for most of the surplus capital that we have. And the discretionary capital that we have left, which is again around ZAR 4 billion because we were able to chase some more capital out, has been earmarked mainly for Africa, where we'd like to not necessarily add substantially a bigger number of countries, but where we would rather like to deepen the relationships and broaden the relationships with our existing people over there. In India, similarly, not expanding massively and doing more with other companies and so forth, but rather do more with our clients. In Southeast Asia, where we would like to bulk up. We're already in Malaysia, where we have a general insurance business. We would like to add some life insurance capabilities to that. And in all those places, there's a solid pipeline of businesses. \r\nJust on the movement. If you look at the discretionary capital there, it started with ZAR 4.2 billion. We did some transactions. We paid a special dividend. We added substantial moneys to that additional capital that we released of around ZAR 2 billion. We had excellent investment returns. We did a few other things and so that added another ZAR 700 million. So we ended the year off with ZAR 4 billion. That's a substantial war chest, but we have a pipeline to utilize most of that, what we see in the foreseeable future, in the next year, 1.5 years and so forth. So we're working on that. \r\nJust to give you a snapshot of the journey that we've been on, on the capital. You can see the capital that we've been releasing since 2005, over the last 8 -- 7, 8 years, around ZAR 30 billion. Of that, we bought back quite a bit of our shares when we thought we were trading at substantially below embedded value. You can see we used about ZAR 13 billion, ZAR 14 billion for that. We used quite a bit to invest in emerging markets, selective basis. We also invested a bit on the developed markets mainly to complement our offering in South Africa and make seamless transfers of moneys into the U.K. and so forth. And we also paid a special dividend, and so -- and we have a bit of discretion -- discretionary capital at the top. It's a consistent story, and it's been adding substantial value for us. We think that we will continue with that. \r\nAnd if you really look at that, what it's achieved for us, if you look at the picture in 2005 in the group embedded value, we've had a lot of capital. A lot of them -- of it lazy. We had a relatively small in-force, and we had a relatively small nonlife business. We essentially sold our APSA stake, which was the biggest part of our life-required capital, and we used that money fairly wisely by growing our value of in-force component, by growing our diversification into nonlife businesses, and by paying out a little bit of the surplus capital and so, elsewhere. But overall, it's been a pretty picture. And the change in that composition makes us a much-higher yielding business and has been responsible for a big transformation in terms of the value components of what we've been doing. \r\nI think with those few remarks, I would like to invite Kobus Möller, our Financial Director, up to the podium to come and share with us the actual numbers. Kobus?\n\n---\n\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. It's a pleasure to share with you some of the main features of our results for 2013. To start with, just a reminder of some of the changes in the disclosure in our results, very similar to what we've done in the interim stage already. We've adopted IFRS 10, so that required some restatement. We had to -- consolidated some additional entities. It did have an impact on the presentation of the results, but not on the bottom line. Similarly, we've also made some changes to the investment classification on the face of the balance sheet to be aligned with the SAM requirements, with SAM invest -- reporting requirements. STC has been replaced with withholding tax. And then we also made some changes in the presentation of our non-life operations to align that with the way that we disclose our life operations in the equity value, where we actually show the dividends that we expect to receive from those businesses as separate from the actual face value of the value -- of the entities. Johan already referred to the changes in the interest rates and the effect that, that had on our results, in particular, the long rates, the effect on the risk discount rate and the value that we put on value of new business and also on some of the other valuations of our businesses.\r\nIn summary, the Group Equity Value ended the year with ZAR 84 billion, which is ZAR 41 a share, which gave us a return of 17.7% on an absolute value and on a per share basis, 17%. If you make an adjustment for the impact of the market, the adjusted return is 10.6%, which is just marginally below our hurdle for the period. And I'll come back to that and the reasons for that.\r\nOur operating profit increased by 35% and headline earnings by 36%. And I'll show you some of the detail there. Based on the underlying increase in the cash earnings, of course we base our dividend on our cash earnings, the board declared a dividend of ZAR 2 a share, which is 21% up on the ZAR 1.65 that we've declared last year. Our new business volumes, if you include the low margin white label business, up 26% with some good net fund flows and a 12% increase in the value of new business based on the actual discount rate.\r\nIf I turn to our individual businesses and starting with Sanlam Personal Finance, SPF. SPF had a very good year in terms of the operational performance, a 31% increase in new business volumes. In the entry-level market, we continue to see good growth from our group business or voluntary group business and also our agency flows [ph]. Growth in excess of 20% there. In line with what -- the trend that we've seen in the past reporting periods, there is some reduction in the business being written by brokers in that segment of the market. So that was also the case for this time around. Middle income continue to see good growth, in particular at single premiums, but also in the retirement annuity business that we write. And then in the affluent market, we continue to see very good inflows, in particular on the investment side onto the Glacier platform, in excess of 50%, again, for this -- for the last year. And you can also see that in the net flows. On the platform, we had almost a ZAR 14 billion net positive inflow in the last year. In the middle income, we had some negative flows, but that's essentially reflecting the higher markets. The benefits that we pay are actually higher because of the growth in the markets. The value of new business of Sanlam Personal Finance only up by 5%, if you apply the actual discount rate. On a comparable rate, the increase was actually 19% to just more than ZAR 1 billion. In particular, when we write risk business in the entry-level market and, to a lesser extent, in the middle market, changing the discount rate has a material impact. And that is the main reason why we actually show a minus 4% for entry-level, where the growth in the volumes was actually much better than that. The new business margin, slightly lower if you express it on the actual discount rate. But again, if you apply a comparable rate, margin is slightly up on last year. The high level of the margin entry-level, obviously, reflect the fact that we only write the risk business there, where the weight is much higher towards investment business, both in the middle-income market and even more so in the affluent market business.\r\nOperating profit of SPF up 24%, both gross and on a net basis. We still get the bulk of our profit in that cluster from the middle-income market, the more mature, stable book of business. They had the benefit of higher markets, which actually impacted on some of the fees earned, but a very credible performance from that middle-income market. The other parts of the business did well. Entry-level more than doubled the profit and very good underwriting performance, but also the impact of the markets, assisting the Sky business there. So one wouldn't expect -- necessarily expect that level to be sustainable, but an excellent performance there. Glacier, effect of the market assisting there with a 39% increase in their profit. And then personal loans, up 6% on last year, slightly lower growth than in the past, really reflecting some of the pressure that we also are seeing in that book in terms of our bad debt provisions. It's still well under control, but we do see some pressure on the book and we're doing -- taking some actions to address that. Overall, on that cluster, the SPF cluster, we earned just more than 20% return on the last year, excellent, excellent return.\r\nSanlam Emerging Markets actually put a 25% drop in total business flows. I think it's very much distorted by the fact that it actually sold our unit trust business in Namibia to Bank Windhoek as part of acquiring a big stake in the holding company of Bank Windhoek. So if you exclude that, business volumes actually did very well in Emerging Markets, in particular in those profitable areas, the recurring premium life business. You can see that also reflected in the value of new business. In Namibia, we had recurring premium life business growing in excess of 20%. In Botswana, by about 30%. And the Rest of Africa, excess of 40%, and that is really what we're targeting -- the profitable business. So we are very happy with the performance that we have seen from our emerging market business flows. The India/Malaysia line for the first time now also include a contribution from Pacific & Orient. It is about ZAR 350 million in the ZAR 900 million that we've reported for them. So overall, the value of new business, as I've said, increasing by 36% from our Emerging Market business.\r\nThe profit from the Emerging Markets doubled on last year -- more than doubled in the case of -- on a net basis to more than ZAR 1 billion for the first time. A big part of that is acquired profit, where we actually for the first time report some of the businesses in our results. In Namibia, that would be our effective stake in Bank Windhoek. And in India/Malaysia, it would be Pacific & Orient and also the increased holding in Shriram. If you exclude that on a net basis, the increase is about 40%. So still a very credible performance by the core of the businesses, both in Namibia and Botswana doing very well. But the businesses in the Rest of Africa growing by 85%, and all our businesses did very well. Ghana, Kenya, Zambia and Malawi all performed very well in terms of the profit contribution. And our return on this cluster of businesses was almost 30% for the year last year.\r\nSanlam Investments had net investments flows of just ZAR 1.7 billion last year. We already alluded to that at the interim stage that we have lost a few sizable mandates during the year, in particular the DRC [ph], as a result of some of the mandate adjustments or rebalancing the they've done withdrew about ZAR 10 billion from SIM. So that had a major impact on the net flows. But if you exclude that, you will see the other businesses did exceptionally well in terms of new flows, our wealth management business and  [indiscernible] private clients, as well as our international business that did very well in terms of new business flows. On the life side, our Sanlam U.K. business, as you can see, about 150% growth. In pound terms, they did very well. But if you translate that into rand, even better. The business that they write are slightly lower margin than South Africa. So you can also see that in the average margin achieved that came down slightly over the year. And the growth in the value of new business also slightly a bit lower than the actual growth in life business, but still a very good performance in terms of business flows in that cluster.\r\nProfit-wise, 30% growth in gross profit, 33% on a net basis from the investment cluster. Our investment management business performed exceptionally well with a 56% growth, based on the investment performance that you've seen earlier. We have earned much higher performance fees than last year, which did make a substantial contribution. But even without that, the growth is 44% last year-on-year. So the core of the business performed very well. And that's both in South Africa and the international part of that business. SCM, capital management, actually had a very good year. You will recall again that we had to provide for our exposure to First Strut in the first half of the year. That had a major impact on their results. If you exclude that, it's quite a sizable increase in the comparable profit year-on-year for Sanlam Capital Markets. Overall, the return on that cluster, the return on Group Equity Value for the cluster, 26%.\r\nYou have seen the Santam results when they announced their results. They had another difficult year in terms of particular catastrophe events and some crop losses that impacted on their results, particularly the underwriting margin. But as Johan have also indicated and given the circumstances and what we've seen from the rest of the industry, they've actually weathered the storm quite well. And we're pleased with that result. What did impact on our return on our Group Equity Value is the movement in the Santam share price over the period. Of course, we take that into account when we calculate the RoGE for the group. Their share price was -- didn't really change over the year. So that had annual yield at 1.5% return on a group level. And if you look at the RoGE for the group in total, that had a negative impact. But once you see that relative to the 44% that we've achieved in the year before, so that's from quite a high base.\r\nOverall business flows up 26%, both life insurance and our investment business, strong growth. And also on a net basis, even without -- with the fact that we've lost some mandates in investment management side, we still achieved 26% net inflows in our business. The value of new covered business overall net of minority interest up 12% to ZAR 1.3 billion. If we -- on a comparable economic basis, it's almost ZAR 1.45 billion, up 23% on last year. And the bulk of the difference actually is, as I have mentioned, in Personal Finance, where we write the risk business. And the margins more or less staying at a similar level than last year's as well.\r\nOur total net operating profit, ZAR 5.4 billion, up 35% on last year. Johan already mentioned that if you exclude the acquired profit or the areas that we account for the first time, the comparable number is a 25% increase. He also mentioned that in the ZAR 5.4 billion, about 26% of that is the profit contribution from our international businesses, the non-South African component compared to 16% last year. I think what is also worth noting is that if you look at the core South African business, excluding any of the international component or the impact of the exchange rate is, there was still a 20% increase in those businesses, which means that the core South African business also performed exceptionally well, notwithstanding the fact that we've been adding growth businesses to that over time.\r\nAnd the balance of our income statement. So net operating profit, up 35%. We had very good investment returns from already high base in the year, adding another ZAR 3 billion. So our normalized headline earnings increased by 36% year-on-year to just more than ZAR 8 billion. If you account for the IFRS required treatment of Sanlam shares being held by our portfolios, of the policyholder portfolios, headline earnings is up by 40% or 38% -- 39% per share.\r\nOur Group Equity Value, I have mentioned, it's up to ZAR 84 billion at the end of December, of which about 76% -- ZAR 76 billion represents the group operations. In the ZAR 84 billion, about 51% will be our life business still. So it's still the biggest part of that. And about 40% will be our other non-life operations, with the balance being our discretionary capital of ZAR 4 billion and essentially the provision for our final dividend that also sits in the discretionary capital line.\r\nAll our businesses, with the exception of Santam, well exceeded the hurdles that we've set in terms of the return for the year. You can see from Santam, Personal Finance, Emerging Markets, Investments, all in excess of 20%. The Santam really reflecting the performance of the share price there.\r\nThe ZAR 13.3 billion value add or the 17.7% on the previous slide, if you break that down just in some of its components. At the bottom you see EV earnings. That's the contribution from our life business, ZAR 9 billion of the ZAR 13 billion. And that's a return of 24% -- 23%, 24% on our -- from our life businesses, a very good performance. Non-life business added 4% (sic) [ZAR 4 billion]. That includes the Santam position. That's about a 14% return year-on-year. So it's at the lower end, but I think under the circumstances, quite a good performance.\r\nIf you break the EV earnings, or the life part down into its components. Net value of new business, ZAR 1.3 billion. You've seen the operating experience variances exceeding ZAR 1 billion for the first time. All our businesses achieved positive risk experience, as well as positive persistency experience. It's an ongoing trend. A very pleasing trend for us. And then the minus number, the ZAR 1.077 billion, that is really the impact of the higher risk discount rate, the net impact of that. What we do to get to an adjusted number is to exclude the impact of the market. And in the last column, you see that on a normalized and adjusted basis the return was the ZAR 8.5 billion, which is about 11% on the absolute value.\r\nIn summary, I'm very pleased to report that we continue on our strategy. We continue to add shareholder value by focusing on our return on Group Equity Value. Profitable growth on track, as I have mentioned. Our core business performing very well. And we continue to add to that fast-growing, strong growing, growth market business to get us to a 35% growth in the current period. Our diversification strategy is working for us that we can actually absorb less-than-normal performance for us from -- for example, this year from Santam. And then we continue to focus on sound capital management in the group as Johan also mentioned with our focus really to find investment opportunities in growth markets and pleasing in the current year that those newer positions [ph] have immediately started to make quite a sizable contribution to our profit number.\r\nThere's the last slide, if you look at over a longer term, if the gray or the shaded area is our performance hurdle that we've set, the top line shows that we, on a cumulative basis, outperformed that by quite a margin if you start measuring that from the listing of the company in 1998.\r\nWith that, back to Johan for the rest of the presentation.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Kobus. Now the results were fairly good. And yesterday at the board meeting, the management continuously wanted to refer back to the results. The board wanted to know more about this year and next year. So let me share a bit of what we need to do this year. On the Personal Finance side, which is the biggest business, it's our retail business, individual businesses in South Africa. The focus there will be, we expect interest rates to rise further. And the focus will be firstly on getting sales and to maintain margins in this market, which will be tougher. The strategy there to achieve that is to grow the adviser force in all the market segments. We would like, particularly in the emerging -- in the lower end of the market, the entry-level market in our Sanlam Sky business, add quite a bit to that adviser force. Also, in the middle market. And then we have a strategy also from people who don't like the added regulation and FAIS legislation would rather be in the umbrella of a bigger brother or sister to -- and will abandon being an independent. So there's a whole strategy there to grow the adviser force in all the segments. There's a big focus on product innovation, particularly in the recurring premium area. I think we fell behind a little bit. We had big, big IT renovations. We renewed our new platform last year and the year before. So we fell a bit behind. And so there's a whole pipeline of new products being launched and coming on board. And while we've been doing extremely well, the one area where we've been lagging in the personal lines business and the individual business in South Africa has been the recurring premiums, where most of our peers have been growing. So we're trying to get back to that. There's a big focus on that, particularly the risk business, getting the right premiums in and growing there. In the Sanlam Sky broker channel, you would have seen that we didn't grow as we wanted there. In fact, we've gone a little bit backwards. Now partly that is because of the economic pressure some of the brokers are under in the lower end of the market. But also, it's been partly because of our increased, I think, hurdles -- the higher hurdles that we have for taking business on board. We're not taking business from people who are overly indebted and things like that. And so we've struggled in this market a little bit. So there's a whole strategy around that where we can support our brokers there through training and a range of other issues to write sustainable business there. The second part that we have to do in this market is, you would have seen the tight economic conditions that we've been referring you to. And you would have seen the slight up-tick in lapse rates and things like that, Section 14 transfers out of the book and so forth. We'll be basing tremendous focus, like in the past, still the focus but heightening our efforts to keep business on the book. And increasingly, there's no point in writing business if it's to disappear 2 or 3 years down the line. So we're doing a lot to get persistency back to where we are happy with it. I want to stress that we're well within our assumption levels in what we assume, but we'll have to do something there, given particularly the industrial action that we've seen and other things that simply make it easier for people to churn the business. There will be a continued focus on operational inefficiency and cost management. I think this business has to be commended on the increase in cost -- in the cost base across this business. The inflation rate has been about 5.8%  [indiscernible].  Overall, the costs in this business increased by around 5% or so. It's a tremendous effort in a tough environment where there's -- particularly on getting and retaining good people, and so you have to pay more. We've seen the deterioration in the currency impacting particularly on IT costs. We are heavily into IT here. We spend around ZAR 1 billion, ZAR 1.2 billion a year in this business, but really managing that whole cost efficiency will be a key thing. Because this is a South African business, dealing with individuals, it is important that we also get the transformation thing going there and retaining the emphasis on that. I'm very pleased to announce that we also got our new certificate on our performance in terms of our broad-based black economic empowerment performance, our scorecard, which was audited and approved also the day before yesterday. We're a Level 2 provider for the first time. And we're making steady progress on all fronts with respect to transforming the business. And increasingly, the business is reflecting the demographics of South Africa. And lastly, I think there is a big focus on meeting our regulatory obligations, and these are several. In this particular business, it's firstly about treating customers fairly. TCF is embedded in all our processes, from the board level right down. We have the reporting in place to really manage everything and every aspect of the business according to the TCF rules and so forth. And we would like to think that we're certainly a leader amongst our peers in that particular area of TCF in South Africa. There is also a big focus on the regulatory capital, on the SAM process. I've already spoken that we've taken a conservative approach with respect to that. We're not going to change our capital massively in this year until we're certain where it's heading. For the moment, we are working hard in playing a full role with respect to those things. And then around the new commissions and the retail, the focus on retail distribution that we have quite a few issues that will impact this business. I think we're well-placed to manage them. And by and large, we think big businesses like ours will benefit from the regulatory changes that we actually see. People will increasingly move away from being on their own, where the regulatory obligations are often onerous. Much rather come into a fold of a bigger company, where there's support and help in order to meet those obligations. Of course, we're not on our own there. Our major peers also have strategy to -- strategies to gain from this. And so we're working hard to be at the front of the pack. If we look at Emerging Markets, they've done extremely well this year. For the first time contributing more than ZAR 1 billion of profit on a net basis. The focus for us will remain on Africa, India and Southeast Asia. And we are not going to change our model. We have a partnership model there, mainly using different brands, which are well-established in these countries. We don't know everything that's going on in these countries. We're reliant on partners to help manage client relations, regulatory relations and a whole range of issues, but up until now it's been working fairly well. And we would like to remain that focus. The big focus for us is rather than to expand just the number of countries that we're in and maybe stretch beyond what we can manage, rather deepen the relationships in the countries where we are. So it's continue on the top line growth, efficiencies and capital optimization within the current operations.\r\nBotswana, becoming more mature really looking at costs. For many years, they have simply focused on the growth component of the business, increasingly as this growth is slowing to also look at more efficiencies.\r\nWithin Shriram, we have 5 businesses there. One of them being a big distribution business to credit businesses, general insurance business, to life insurance businesses, lots of synergies between these businesses. And we've been contributing massively towards unlocking of those synergies, but there's still a lot to do already. There's a number of IT implementations that we have across Africa. As we grow the businesses, the old platforms that these people have -- IT platforms -- suddenly become too small to handle volumes and so forth. We have to upgrade most of the systems. We are busy with upgrades in -- virtually across the board, in Zambia, in Kenya, in Botswana, in Namibia, just to name but a few. So we're supporting those businesses from here in order to do those things. We often find that the skill base not necessarily available in the countries that we deal with, so there's a big dependency on what we can do and the support that we can provide from South Africa. We would like to deepen our existing relationships, bolt-on transactions. So far this year, we announced one particular one. We acquired Oasis General Insurance, together with our partner, First Bank of Nigeria, in Nigeria to complement the Life business. We've been at the Life business 3, 4 years now. It's become a profitable business. It's growing, it's exceeding expectations, so be ready for the next phase and we've added now the General Insurance base, we'll be integrating that, and we'll be growing that. And we'll be doing similar things in other countries in Africa. In India, we're trying to get to the synergies, deepening the relationships. I've gone on to the board of Shriram Capital there to give some input and to help with those processes from the top end. And Malaysia, we're really trying to -- we have a General Insurance business, we'd like to add some Life and Other businesses. We've also announced in December that there's a Santam co-investment agreement. They provide us while -- within some emerging markets we also deal with General Insurance. There's an agreement where they bought an economic stake of 35% of what we have in these countries. And in return for that, they provide us with technical expertise and so. So it's really to bet [ph] that down, and we're recruiting a number of people from Santam that will come across to manage their investment within Sanlam, and to make sure that reinsurance opportunities that do arise from our operations or so are adequately addressed within Santam and are taken care of. So there's a big drive to also create that synergies and help Santam to grow their business. Then organizational capacity to support growth is critically important. As issues arise, we move people from our -- from mainly from our Sanlam Retail business, from our Investment business, from Santam, to come and join the Emerging Markets team to strengthen that. Some on a project basis if we have issues, some others on a more permanent basis, but it's a critical component. And the other issue is the compliance and governance and reporting. We have rigid standards and very high standards in terms of what many of the countries we deal with have been exposed to in the past. So it's quite a journey to make sure that they're reporting the management, the risk management and the other issues that we face within these countries are at the same level in what we have over here in South Africa. So there's an ongoing focus of training, support and in the areas of compliance, reporting and so forth. So that's going fairly well. On the investment side, the focus is firstly to maintain the investment performance, the good performance that we've seen. Most of the value investors struggled in 2012, with momentum investors doing well. We've seen some return to value investments doing better. And last year, you could see it in our results as well, so it's about retaining what we have. Particularly, we have a fixed benchmark. I think a big area for us is to improve institutional fund flows, to improve retail funds flows, where the margins are substantially higher and so. And in order to affect that, we changed the business quite substantially, and separated essentially the product factory, the investment component, from the 2 markets that we have. So we've set up a much more client-centric structure that we will be leveraging off. In addition to that, we will expand our African funds proposition. We already have an African property fund. We would like to develop our African debt fund in there. We have an African equity fund, listed equity fund, and we have other 2 opportunities; not only with our own money, but increasingly to draw money in there and so forth. And once or twice, you get a setback -- some of our people have been locked up just before the weekend for not having the right visa. The people behind the counter ran out of time, and the last 5 people and the people, they just said well, we don't have time for you guys. You have to sleep in our facility here overnight. Not the greatest kind of accommodation you'll get from that. But overall, things are going fairly well. Cost effective solution across the value chain, critical. We bought Satrix, it's doing well. Optimizing the active versus passive management business models, I think we're doing that fairly well at the moment. We need to do much better on the passive side. We've paid a fair amount for Satrix. But we think, in South Africa in particular, that there's still scope for the ETF -- for that whole ETF space to grow quite substantially. And then this business depends very much on what happens in the Retail business. It depends a lot on what happens in other areas of Sanlam. And I think there's a lot of improvement that we can make in terms of collaboration and efficiencies. We don't -- we get small amounts of our own flows into the Retail business. If you look at the bigger picture, into our own Investment business, I think we can do better there. In Santam, the story there is quite clear. It's been a tough 2 years. I'm very happy with the progress that we're making in getting the premium increases through, in doing better risk underwriting and so forth. And already last year, as opposed to 2012, we were much better and had smaller exposure to particularly [ph]  These hailstorms and several of the floods and so forth, through deliberate actions that we've taken in this business. I think growth is important in this business. We've seen market diversification, we have a few special projects in place there: The investment in the Sanlam Emerging Market partners. Santam RE [ph]; the Specialist businesses and then MiWay, which has really been making a tremendous contribution towards growth in the personal lines market. The size and quality of the risk pool, we do much better. We're really addressing a whole range of things there. There are a number of key projects that we're implementing to better underwrite on a scientific way. Up until now, it's been major groups and so forth. We have a project in that. We would like to take the scientific underwriting that we follow in the direct model and implement some of the key characteristics of that, also in the personal lines broker market. So we're working on that. There is a big drive through the value chain to get efficiencies going, the focus is on cost. I think we can do much better on the claims side still. We are really optimizing a lot of that, but it's -- it requires a new look, particularly now that the rand is weak, and a lot of what we have to replace is simply imported stuff. And then, we have a number of strategic projects also that I've already mentioned, going through that. So overall, there's more than enough to keep us busy, and we think you know that we can make a tremendous impact for the year. For the outlook for the rest of year, we're getting the improved traction in the developed economies, the twofold impact. It will be supportive of economic activity in Emerging Markets, maybe not immediately. We've already seen there's sort of a year lag when it happens, but we feel a positive that eventually, with the increased traction in developed markets will have a trickle-down effect to ourselves. But more importantly, in the shorter-term, the tapering of quantitative easing will result in volatility in the currency. We think the weakening of the currency has been overdone. The investment market performance is on a high, we're relatively expensive, and we don't necessarily expect the same kind of returns going forward. In fact, we're much more cautious about the future. For us, a big focus is bedding down new acquisitions. We've been investing quite a bit, and we'll be pulling quite a few people from our existing businesses, SPF and so, to strengthen the team that we have within our Emerging Markets business. So making sure that we actually get what we plan. Big issue in South Africa is regulatory. I think it would be the regulatory pressures then changes that we see. Retirement reform is a big issue. You would have heard the Minister of Finance speaking in the budget about costs in retirement form. As an industry, we've agreed that if we can get certain things in place, particularly compulsion, and particularly, if we can keep preservation by keep -- in keeping their retirement funds on the platform, without it being disappearing every 6 months for people moving jobs and so forth, we can drive down cost quite substantially. We'd like to do that. The big beneficiaries will be, of course, the clients, but also businesses like ours, where you get compulsions in countries like Chile and Australia and so forth. Private sector has benefited tremendously from what's happening there. So we really work with the regulatory authorities and particularly Treasury there, to create an environment where everybody is better off. Commission changes, a critical thing for us, because it affects the people that we deal with. We're working on that, fees, independence, tied agents and these kinds of things. So it may have some impact on us. I think we're really well placed with the models that we have in place. This year, I've already spoken about, it is finalizing our approaches and making sure that the stuff is bedded down and properly entrenched, and then the big, sort of, \r\n[Audio Gap]\r\na few questions still around Solvency Assessment and Management, which is all around capital. We think there will be more clarity on how it will impact us. We're busy with Quest 3 [ph], and once we have the results of those, we can again, a gauge on the results on the industry, and how it will impact the industry and so forth. So quite a few things. Ladies and gentlemen, and that brings the end to our story. I think in summary, very good results. As team, we've been together for quite a while. I've been with, as you know, I think, it's the 11th time, 11th year that I've been up here, reporting on our performance. Certainly within the life and savings industries, it's the best performance that we've had. We've been carried many years by Santam. This year, we were able to carry them. And in spite of what's been happening there, we're pretty proud of the results, and we think it's fairly solid. I would like to open the floor now for questions on a few things, and André, if you and Kobus can join us, there on the chairs, I'd really appreciate that. If you have a question, please put up your hand. People will get to you with the microphone and then introduce yourself and we -- and fire away.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of the Investment Analysts Society, we would like to thank Sanlam at the outset for hosting us here today in the presentation for the results of the year ended December 2013. The director [ph] from sales, the executives, members of the board, we thank you. \r\nSanlam has its origins almost 100 years old. I don't want to preempt anything about what happens in 2018, but it was formed in 1918. It was incorporated as an enterprise to mobilize investment savings in South Africa through various investment products. This company has done that over the years and particularly in the formative years in the '30s through to the '70s when it formed closed investment trusts as a medium of investment. And in those trusts, it invested in small enterprises. And over the years, those small enterprises are today major enterprises in South Africa. Many of them are listed. Some of the market capitalizations today far exceeding that of Sanlam. Sanlam's market capitalization takes it into the top 50 companies in South Africa. But there are many ahead, and there are many unlisted companies and there are many below that owe their origins of capital and investment to Sanlam. \r\nSanlam has always been a company that's been on the forefront of investment enterprise in South Africa no more so than today, as it embraces a new social and economic order. And so it's with great interest today that we thank you not only for inviting us, but to share in the results of what has been achieved over the past 12 months, and gain insight as to where this company is going to in the future and playing such a vital part in the enterprise of -- for all South Africans. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nThank you so much for that introduction, and the advertisement as well. Ladies and gentlemen, it's a pleasure to welcome you all here at the -- our annual results presentation on 2013. Before I really start, I would like to welcome a few special guests, some of our board members here: our Chairman, Desmond Smith; other board members, Philip Rademeyer; Rejoice Simelane; Bernard Swanepoel; a few staff members here from the EXCO, Temba Mvusi; Tema Gametsi [ph]; and so. And people who'll join me in answering questions and doing part of the presentation here: Kobus Möller, our Financial Director; and Andre Zeeman, our Chief Actuary and also Chief Risk Officer. We would like to also welcome some of our other partners here: the FSB, our regulator; SARS, our big partner; and some business people here from our businesses, welcome. \r\nLadies and gentlemen, our presentation as usual will focus a bit on the operating environment, which I'll cover, to set the scene for the results. I think the results are meaningless without taking into account what we had to deal with. And then I'll give you a strategic overview of the business, some of the main results and where we're heading. Kobus Möller, our Financial Director, will talk a little bit about the financials, give you the actual results and the feedback. And I'll end off with the outlook and priorities that we have for this year, things that we'll be tackling, and our vision for the future. Then there will be some question time and Andre Zeeman, our Chief Actuary, will also join us because I'm sure some of those questions will be fairly technical in nature. \r\nStarting off with the operating environment. I have to, from the outset, say it's been a tough year. It is -- the fundamentals remain uncertain and increasingly, there is no predictability. If we really look at the operating environment, the conditions were quite challenging, slow global recovery. But I must say signs of improvement, but it's not necessarily all well and particularly Europe is still struggling. Some of the big news with respect to the Emerging Markets of which we're  [ph] one [ph] is the tapering of the quantitative easing that is impacting negatively on emerging markets. And we felt it ourselves, but a big part of our focus is also Emerging Markets, and we have to reexamine on how we're going to roll out our strategy there. We've also seen the low short-term interest rate environment in 2013, and while we've seen some uptick in interest rates this year, in 2013, the short-term rates were still low. And in particular, we've seen a very weak short-term insurance claim cycle. And our big business there, Santam, actually felt that. And I'll talk a bit later about that as well. \r\nIn South Africa, I'll show you a few slides on the growth, which is low. The interest rates that -- particularly, the long rates having [ph]  Gone up quite a bit. The equity market, that's been very kind to us, and then the currency, that has been weakening, but has been positive for our international businesses and the contribution. And increasingly, we'll also have to talk about Africa and India because they are also forming a bigger part of our business. So I'll show you a few slides on that. \r\nIf we look at the South African economy, I think the overriding factor is the low growth level. Throughout the year in 2013, it's been lowering, the growth expectation, and we now know that it's just around 2%. I think that hides a big part of the positives that we see. Within that low growth rate, there has been a massive redistribution of wealth and a big number of new entrants into the market. If we take the period 2006 to 2012 for which we have data, we've seen a very large number of people becoming part of the mainstream economy, people who have been excluded in the past. And of course, they're underinsured, and in the lower end of the South African market, the entry level, it creates a real opportunity. So despite a difficult period, which we expect to continue for a while, in spite of elections and things like that, where you would expect stimulus and things like that, it is still a tough area. The big focus on opportunity mainly comes from a higher number of people rather than the economy turning around. \r\nIf you look at the interest rates, you can see from the short-term rate is still being relatively low. But the big move that we've seen from the end of last year until now is really the 9-year sort of bond yield, bond rate that went up quite substantially, around 140 basis points. And that will have real negative impacts on our return on group embedded value and the value of new business growth because that is a critical part in the discount factor that we utilize in a big part of our business in the middle market, where we still play a dominant role. So overall, a higher rate means a higher discount rate, lower present value, that is essentially what it is about there. We've seen that thing tick up quite a bit. \r\nThe big story really and a big part for the positive results that we'll be talking about just now has been the SA equity market. You'll see the bond market didn't perform well at all in the past year, in fact, in the -- over the year, only yielded 0.6%. But the equity market did around 18%. And this, I think the key part of that, it's not only that it grew, but it grew off already a high base that was substantially higher than the previous year. So our businesses involved in asset gathering and where people paid fees on the investments really did well. So it was a positive across the board for us. It was offset a little bit by the weak bond market performance. But overall, a positive effect. \r\nThe weakening in the average exchange rate for the rand benefited our non-South African earnings, but it also put pressure on our earnings in South Africa through inflationary effects, and particularly a business like Santam struggled with dealing with the quick drop in the rand where you cannot raise the premiums quickly enough, particularly in the motor business, to adjust for price increases in parts. But you can see against the developed markets around 20% -- between 15% and 20% decrease, so our businesses there did well. And then in Botswana, India, and Rest of Africa, our major component in the Emerging Markets, changes between sort of 5% and 10%. So overall, we benefited from this strength and that contributed to around ZAR 150 million or so positive to our earnings overall. \r\nIf we look at the businesses in Africa and the economy there, in Botswana in particular, which is a big part of our business, the consumer remains under pressure. We have to do a lot of business in the civil service, they haven't had inflationary-type increases in salaries there for quite a while, so they're falling behind. And that put, of course the customers and the clients there under pressure. In the Rest of Africa, we see a low demand for resources, still [ph] resource-driven economies, apart from oil. But overall, the growth remains higher than in South Africa and we're still feeling positive that we're doing the right stuff over there. \r\nIn India, we've seen below-trend economic growth during the last year, but the growth is still just around 5% to 6%, which is substantially higher than elsewhere. And at this growth level, we still add big numbers of people to the middle market, which we're focusing on. And so overall, we're quite positive and bullish -- not necessarily about the overall Indian economy, but what is happening in the market segment that we're targeting. We think there is substantial scope, and we've seen growth rates that we're very proud of. So inflation is relatively high. We also see high-rising interest rates there. But overall, it is benefiting us, and the currency volatility is very similar to that of South Africa. \r\nWithin this environment, our results and how we performed. Firstly, our strategy, still focusing on returns. For us, the return measure is much more important than size or any other metric. We have a big focus on growth trying to add value, and we're growing the profitability through getting new business, through getting diversification to make that growth more robust, but also through cutting costs and making sure that the efficiencies that we run at are really low in terms of low cost-producing businesses. And I think in particular, in the cost management, we've done well in the past year. Although you will see the business flow has also increased quite nicely and so forth. \r\nThe other big part that we're focusing on is capital efficiency. This has been a central theme, optimal application of capital, chasing surplus capital out, lazy capital out, make it discretionary, applying it if we find things, paying special dividends and returning to shareholders if we don't use it. Last year, we did return some. This year, we only pay a normal dividend because we think we have a pipeline of products that may use most of the surplus at the kind of rates and returns that we would like to have. But if you look back at the past 10 years, these 2 key strategies, we think, added around 50% each of the value. About half the value in the Sanlam share that we've seen -- or the increase in value in the last 10 years -- has come from the growth part of it, and around half of it is because of managing the capital substantially better. Of course, there's also an interaction between these 2 as this slide shows you. \r\nThe big part of our businesses is still South Africa. It's fairly mature. It's stable. It gives quite nice cash. It delivers a lot of cash. And the key here is maximizing returns, efficient and effective management of what we have, and then utilizing the surplus cash through paying dividends and so forth. But what we have over and above that, reapplying it through effective capital management in what we believe is the new growth opportunities, the high-yielding areas into Africa, Southeast Asia and some niche areas that we've seen in the asset management industry in the developed world. So it's been a key part of what we're driving, and I think for the first year, this year, we can really see that strategy coming through to the fore, with particularly the international platform into the emerging markets that we're setting up for the future, giving us a really nice kick in terms of profitability and so forth. And if you really look at what's been earned in earnings per share and so forth, you see the net operating profit per share increased by 34%, which we believe is a very credible number given the environment that we're in.  \r\nGranted a lot of that was acquisitive growth, businesses that we bought, Shriram, P&O in Malaysia, 1 or 2 businesses in Africa that we acquired. And if we strip that out, the growth through organic, and the organic growth was in the order of about 25%, 26%, which we think is excellent. \r\nNormalized headline earnings per share up 25%, also a very nice number, on the back of investment markets also helping quite a bit. If we look at business volumes, new business volumes increased 36%. Net fund flows up substantially. Net life value of new business up 12%. The flows were quite nicely up but because we're using higher discount rates, it impacted on that negatively in spite of volumes being higher. The net value of new business margin improved on a constant discount rate, fairly flat. If we use the higher rate Group Equity Value, which is really a measure of the intrinsic value of Sanlam for ZAR 4 121 cents per share and a return on group embedded value per share of roughly 17%, which gives you an ROE of 23%, 24%. It's a bit of a meaningless number in our own case, but it is a substantial number and often people would like to compare that with banks. \r\nSo if you really look at the profitable growth, you can see our value of new business on the Life side increasing substantially, the sources of that where it is coming from, and you see also the effect. The margin is the gray line. On the slide there, you can see that coming slightly down, mainly through the effect of the higher discount rate. As I've said, on the entry-level market, we use the 5-year bond rate, that is -- went up by about 150 basis points from the previous year. And in the middle market and higher end of the market, we now use the 9-year bond rate, which went up around 140 basis points. But if you do that, you'll get the numbers. But overall, the business has been growing something that is very satisfactory. \r\nIf we look at persistency, you can see the numbers there in the middle market. You can also see, towards the end there, the ticking up of lapses, surrenders and so. Partly, it's because the regulatory framework makes it easier for people to shift money away and move it between different players. The second part why we see the tick up is because of the tough economic environment. Now the important thing there is it is well within our assumption base. We're performing well within the assumption base, and we still make persistency profits like you'll see on the -- in terms of what we'll have. And later on Kobus will take you through that. In this graph, you can see when the people lost their jobs in 2008 because of the crisis that we've had across the world in 2007, where 1 million people lost their jobs in South Africa, a mild tick-up, I think less so than our peers, where persistency went south a little bit. We managed to bring it down, but you can see the increasing pressure in the economy. Now for the first time since then, really picking up a little bit, as -- but as I've said, well within our assumption base, and similarly, in the lower end of the market. While we're trying to focus on people who are not indebted, we've really set ourselves up and so forth. Things like the strikes, in particular the platinum area, have been hurting us. \r\nA big part of our business, in fact, in Sanlam Sky, Rustenburg, the Rustenburg branch is by far our biggest and most productive branch. And when you have a lot of strikes over there, those people simply don't earn income, and you'd expect persistency to weaken and you can see that. Again, we're well within our assumption base, and we don't think there's a problem, but we wouldn't like these industrial actions to go on for too long. So we have a big stake riding on that. \r\nOkay. If you look at our investment performance, I think I have to give credit to our -- the team there. If you look at on -- whether you look on a 3-year basis or on a 5-year basis, we have over 90% of the money that we manage -- in this case, well over ZAR 300 billion within SIM -- making the benchmark that we've set for ourselves. We work mainly with fixed benchmarks being an insurer. We would like to get to certain targets. We're not that good when we run in an open race against everybody else, but where we have a fixed target in retirement, and particularly within an insurance company, you would expect us to do well and we've done that. So overall, whichever period you look at, it's been going very well and you can see the up-tick there. \r\nWe -- long-term value investors, we call it pragmatic value because we make assumptions there. And you can really see the strategy doing well for us over a period of time. On experience variances, we've had an exceptional year. For the first time in our history, we've had experience variances, positive experience variances of over ZAR 1 billion. And it's a key part. It surprised us with how big it was -- or it is -- and we don't necessarily expect this to continue because if we expected it to continue, it would have to be capitalized. The source of these experience variances come from several different strategies, which vary a bit from year-to-year. But it also shows the prudence, the consistency and that nothing has changed in the way that we look at the business. \r\nIf we look at the diversification of the base, on the left hand, if you really look at our Group Equity Value, you'll see we are about -- 7, 8 years ago, life insurance used to be half of our business -- 80% of our business. It's roughly half of our business now with other kinds of businesses, short-term insurance, investment management, credit and banking, admin and so forth being the other half. And if you look at the net operating profit, you can see the contribution over there. The life business had really -- came to the party well. The asset management, I think, did particularly well in the past year. Credit banking, particularly Sanlam Capital Markets, did particularly well. Short-term insurance, under pressure. While we have 70% of our assets in there or of our investments, they only contributed 7%. And initially, we thought it's a bad performance. But as more and more of the -- our peers and competitors announced their results, we were feeling much better about what -- how we performed over there. So overall, that the Santam did fairly well. \r\nIf you also look at our footprint, increasingly, you know it's in Africa, Southeast Asia, English-speaking regulatory environment that we understand, where we can make contributions. We have a team from South Africa contributing and interacting in a partnership model outside of South Africa. So overall, it's working and the contribution from our businesses outside of South Africa has been tremendous. While we have 20% of our money invested in our international businesses in terms of our value, our equity value, it contributed 27% of our profits. So it's a sizable number. We haven't made big bets. We've been very cautious about it, and we're pretty proud of the performance there. The return on the group embedded value in our international businesses has been mid-30%. If you take the effects of the markets out on the operational level and so forth, it's been 26%. It's been a very good story for us up till now. And we'd like to strengthen our relationships there and do a bit more. \r\nIf you really look at the growth of the business, this diversification story: 10 years ago, 98% South African business, the bulk of it in life insurance. We were able to grow the pie quite substantially, and you can see there on the right-hand side, just in the past 2 years, on how we've been able to evolve the strategy, different sources of income. And with about 1/3 of it coming from nontraditional areas, places where we and businesses that we were not in 5 years ago, that is really treating us very well because the returns are high and the growth rates are substantially high. So overall, I think a pleasing picture. \r\nAnd if we'll just look, a bit of a forward-looking area. If we look at the life insurance space, South Africa, where we were, 2003 to where we are now, about half of it coming from the traditional areas and half of it coming from new areas. And this is how the book will look a few years from now when we see things mature a little bit. So overall, strategy has been in place for a while and it's starting to deliver results. I think we're pretty pleased about what's been happening there. \r\nBefore we come to the results, 1 or 2 remarks on capital. As you know, we're in the process of implementing the Solvency II regime in South Africa, the one that we call SAM over here, we're taking a fairly prudent approach on the capital while we're awaiting the final SAM specifications. 1 or 2 areas of uncertainty. We hope that there will be more certainty and clarity towards the end of the year, which means that we'll be able to move forward on the capital story. For the moment, we think we are well capitalized and we're not going to change the model substantially until we know exactly where we're heading with the new SAM regime. \r\nWe spent about ZAR 2.5 billion in new investments in growth markets finalized in 2013. We paid around ZAR 1 billion of special dividends last year, which accounted for most of the surplus capital that we have. And the discretionary capital that we have left, which is again around ZAR 4 billion because we were able to chase some more capital out, has been earmarked mainly for Africa, where we'd like to not necessarily add substantially a bigger number of countries, but where we would rather like to deepen the relationships and broaden the relationships with our existing people over there. In India, similarly, not expanding massively and doing more with other companies and so forth, but rather do more with our clients. In Southeast Asia, where we would like to bulk up. We're already in Malaysia, where we have a general insurance business. We would like to add some life insurance capabilities to that. And in all those places, there's a solid pipeline of businesses. \r\nJust on the movement. If you look at the discretionary capital there, it started with ZAR 4.2 billion. We did some transactions. We paid a special dividend. We added substantial moneys to that additional capital that we released of around ZAR 2 billion. We had excellent investment returns. We did a few other things and so that added another ZAR 700 million. So we ended the year off with ZAR 4 billion. That's a substantial war chest, but we have a pipeline to utilize most of that, what we see in the foreseeable future, in the next year, 1.5 years and so forth. So we're working on that. \r\nJust to give you a snapshot of the journey that we've been on, on the capital. You can see the capital that we've been releasing since 2005, over the last 8 -- 7, 8 years, around ZAR 30 billion. Of that, we bought back quite a bit of our shares when we thought we were trading at substantially below embedded value. You can see we used about ZAR 13 billion, ZAR 14 billion for that. We used quite a bit to invest in emerging markets, selective basis. We also invested a bit on the developed markets mainly to complement our offering in South Africa and make seamless transfers of moneys into the U.K. and so forth. And we also paid a special dividend, and so -- and we have a bit of discretion -- discretionary capital at the top. It's a consistent story, and it's been adding substantial value for us. We think that we will continue with that. \r\nAnd if you really look at that, what it's achieved for us, if you look at the picture in 2005 in the group embedded value, we've had a lot of capital. A lot of them -- of it lazy. We had a relatively small in-force, and we had a relatively small nonlife business. We essentially sold our APSA stake, which was the biggest part of our life-required capital, and we used that money fairly wisely by growing our value of in-force component, by growing our diversification into nonlife businesses, and by paying out a little bit of the surplus capital and so, elsewhere. But overall, it's been a pretty picture. And the change in that composition makes us a much-higher yielding business and has been responsible for a big transformation in terms of the value components of what we've been doing. \r\nI think with those few remarks, I would like to invite Kobus Möller, our Financial Director, up to the podium to come and share with us the actual numbers. Kobus?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. It's a pleasure to share with you some of the main features of our results for 2013. To start with, just a reminder of some of the changes in the disclosure in our results, very similar to what we've done in the interim stage already. We've adopted IFRS 10, so that required some restatement. We had to -- consolidated some additional entities. It did have an impact on the presentation of the results, but not on the bottom line. Similarly, we've also made some changes to the investment classification on the face of the balance sheet to be aligned with the SAM requirements, with SAM invest -- reporting requirements. STC has been replaced with withholding tax. And then we also made some changes in the presentation of our non-life operations to align that with the way that we disclose our life operations in the equity value, where we actually show the dividends that we expect to receive from those businesses as separate from the actual face value of the value -- of the entities. Johan already referred to the changes in the interest rates and the effect that, that had on our results, in particular, the long rates, the effect on the risk discount rate and the value that we put on value of new business and also on some of the other valuations of our businesses.\r\nIn summary, the Group Equity Value ended the year with ZAR 84 billion, which is ZAR 41 a share, which gave us a return of 17.7% on an absolute value and on a per share basis, 17%. If you make an adjustment for the impact of the market, the adjusted return is 10.6%, which is just marginally below our hurdle for the period. And I'll come back to that and the reasons for that.\r\nOur operating profit increased by 35% and headline earnings by 36%. And I'll show you some of the detail there. Based on the underlying increase in the cash earnings, of course we base our dividend on our cash earnings, the board declared a dividend of ZAR 2 a share, which is 21% up on the ZAR 1.65 that we've declared last year. Our new business volumes, if you include the low margin white label business, up 26% with some good net fund flows and a 12% increase in the value of new business based on the actual discount rate.\r\nIf I turn to our individual businesses and starting with Sanlam Personal Finance, SPF. SPF had a very good year in terms of the operational performance, a 31% increase in new business volumes. In the entry-level market, we continue to see good growth from our group business or voluntary group business and also our agency flows [ph]. Growth in excess of 20% there. In line with what -- the trend that we've seen in the past reporting periods, there is some reduction in the business being written by brokers in that segment of the market. So that was also the case for this time around. Middle income continue to see good growth, in particular at single premiums, but also in the retirement annuity business that we write. And then in the affluent market, we continue to see very good inflows, in particular on the investment side onto the Glacier platform, in excess of 50%, again, for this -- for the last year. And you can also see that in the net flows. On the platform, we had almost a ZAR 14 billion net positive inflow in the last year. In the middle income, we had some negative flows, but that's essentially reflecting the higher markets. The benefits that we pay are actually higher because of the growth in the markets. The value of new business of Sanlam Personal Finance only up by 5%, if you apply the actual discount rate. On a comparable rate, the increase was actually 19% to just more than ZAR 1 billion. In particular, when we write risk business in the entry-level market and, to a lesser extent, in the middle market, changing the discount rate has a material impact. And that is the main reason why we actually show a minus 4% for entry-level, where the growth in the volumes was actually much better than that. The new business margin, slightly lower if you express it on the actual discount rate. But again, if you apply a comparable rate, margin is slightly up on last year. The high level of the margin entry-level, obviously, reflect the fact that we only write the risk business there, where the weight is much higher towards investment business, both in the middle-income market and even more so in the affluent market business.\r\nOperating profit of SPF up 24%, both gross and on a net basis. We still get the bulk of our profit in that cluster from the middle-income market, the more mature, stable book of business. They had the benefit of higher markets, which actually impacted on some of the fees earned, but a very credible performance from that middle-income market. The other parts of the business did well. Entry-level more than doubled the profit and very good underwriting performance, but also the impact of the markets, assisting the Sky business there. So one wouldn't expect -- necessarily expect that level to be sustainable, but an excellent performance there. Glacier, effect of the market assisting there with a 39% increase in their profit. And then personal loans, up 6% on last year, slightly lower growth than in the past, really reflecting some of the pressure that we also are seeing in that book in terms of our bad debt provisions. It's still well under control, but we do see some pressure on the book and we're doing -- taking some actions to address that. Overall, on that cluster, the SPF cluster, we earned just more than 20% return on the last year, excellent, excellent return.\r\nSanlam Emerging Markets actually put a 25% drop in total business flows. I think it's very much distorted by the fact that it actually sold our unit trust business in Namibia to Bank Windhoek as part of acquiring a big stake in the holding company of Bank Windhoek. So if you exclude that, business volumes actually did very well in Emerging Markets, in particular in those profitable areas, the recurring premium life business. You can see that also reflected in the value of new business. In Namibia, we had recurring premium life business growing in excess of 20%. In Botswana, by about 30%. And the Rest of Africa, excess of 40%, and that is really what we're targeting -- the profitable business. So we are very happy with the performance that we have seen from our emerging market business flows. The India/Malaysia line for the first time now also include a contribution from Pacific & Orient. It is about ZAR 350 million in the ZAR 900 million that we've reported for them. So overall, the value of new business, as I've said, increasing by 36% from our Emerging Market business.\r\nThe profit from the Emerging Markets doubled on last year -- more than doubled in the case of -- on a net basis to more than ZAR 1 billion for the first time. A big part of that is acquired profit, where we actually for the first time report some of the businesses in our results. In Namibia, that would be our effective stake in Bank Windhoek. And in India/Malaysia, it would be Pacific & Orient and also the increased holding in Shriram. If you exclude that on a net basis, the increase is about 40%. So still a very credible performance by the core of the businesses, both in Namibia and Botswana doing very well. But the businesses in the Rest of Africa growing by 85%, and all our businesses did very well. Ghana, Kenya, Zambia and Malawi all performed very well in terms of the profit contribution. And our return on this cluster of businesses was almost 30% for the year last year.\r\nSanlam Investments had net investments flows of just ZAR 1.7 billion last year. We already alluded to that at the interim stage that we have lost a few sizable mandates during the year, in particular the DRC [ph], as a result of some of the mandate adjustments or rebalancing the they've done withdrew about ZAR 10 billion from SIM. So that had a major impact on the net flows. But if you exclude that, you will see the other businesses did exceptionally well in terms of new flows, our wealth management business and  [indiscernible] private clients, as well as our international business that did very well in terms of new business flows. On the life side, our Sanlam U.K. business, as you can see, about 150% growth. In pound terms, they did very well. But if you translate that into rand, even better. The business that they write are slightly lower margin than South Africa. So you can also see that in the average margin achieved that came down slightly over the year. And the growth in the value of new business also slightly a bit lower than the actual growth in life business, but still a very good performance in terms of business flows in that cluster.\r\nProfit-wise, 30% growth in gross profit, 33% on a net basis from the investment cluster. Our investment management business performed exceptionally well with a 56% growth, based on the investment performance that you've seen earlier. We have earned much higher performance fees than last year, which did make a substantial contribution. But even without that, the growth is 44% last year-on-year. So the core of the business performed very well. And that's both in South Africa and the international part of that business. SCM, capital management, actually had a very good year. You will recall again that we had to provide for our exposure to First Strut in the first half of the year. That had a major impact on their results. If you exclude that, it's quite a sizable increase in the comparable profit year-on-year for Sanlam Capital Markets. Overall, the return on that cluster, the return on Group Equity Value for the cluster, 26%.\r\nYou have seen the Santam results when they announced their results. They had another difficult year in terms of particular catastrophe events and some crop losses that impacted on their results, particularly the underwriting margin. But as Johan have also indicated and given the circumstances and what we've seen from the rest of the industry, they've actually weathered the storm quite well. And we're pleased with that result. What did impact on our return on our Group Equity Value is the movement in the Santam share price over the period. Of course, we take that into account when we calculate the RoGE for the group. Their share price was -- didn't really change over the year. So that had annual yield at 1.5% return on a group level. And if you look at the RoGE for the group in total, that had a negative impact. But once you see that relative to the 44% that we've achieved in the year before, so that's from quite a high base.\r\nOverall business flows up 26%, both life insurance and our investment business, strong growth. And also on a net basis, even without -- with the fact that we've lost some mandates in investment management side, we still achieved 26% net inflows in our business. The value of new covered business overall net of minority interest up 12% to ZAR 1.3 billion. If we -- on a comparable economic basis, it's almost ZAR 1.45 billion, up 23% on last year. And the bulk of the difference actually is, as I have mentioned, in Personal Finance, where we write the risk business. And the margins more or less staying at a similar level than last year's as well.\r\nOur total net operating profit, ZAR 5.4 billion, up 35% on last year. Johan already mentioned that if you exclude the acquired profit or the areas that we account for the first time, the comparable number is a 25% increase. He also mentioned that in the ZAR 5.4 billion, about 26% of that is the profit contribution from our international businesses, the non-South African component compared to 16% last year. I think what is also worth noting is that if you look at the core South African business, excluding any of the international component or the impact of the exchange rate is, there was still a 20% increase in those businesses, which means that the core South African business also performed exceptionally well, notwithstanding the fact that we've been adding growth businesses to that over time.\r\nAnd the balance of our income statement. So net operating profit, up 35%. We had very good investment returns from already high base in the year, adding another ZAR 3 billion. So our normalized headline earnings increased by 36% year-on-year to just more than ZAR 8 billion. If you account for the IFRS required treatment of Sanlam shares being held by our portfolios, of the policyholder portfolios, headline earnings is up by 40% or 38% -- 39% per share.\r\nOur Group Equity Value, I have mentioned, it's up to ZAR 84 billion at the end of December, of which about 76% -- ZAR 76 billion represents the group operations. In the ZAR 84 billion, about 51% will be our life business still. So it's still the biggest part of that. And about 40% will be our other non-life operations, with the balance being our discretionary capital of ZAR 4 billion and essentially the provision for our final dividend that also sits in the discretionary capital line.\r\nAll our businesses, with the exception of Santam, well exceeded the hurdles that we've set in terms of the return for the year. You can see from Santam, Personal Finance, Emerging Markets, Investments, all in excess of 20%. The Santam really reflecting the performance of the share price there.\r\nThe ZAR 13.3 billion value add or the 17.7% on the previous slide, if you break that down just in some of its components. At the bottom you see EV earnings. That's the contribution from our life business, ZAR 9 billion of the ZAR 13 billion. And that's a return of 24% -- 23%, 24% on our -- from our life businesses, a very good performance. Non-life business added 4% (sic) [ZAR 4 billion]. That includes the Santam position. That's about a 14% return year-on-year. So it's at the lower end, but I think under the circumstances, quite a good performance.\r\nIf you break the EV earnings, or the life part down into its components. Net value of new business, ZAR 1.3 billion. You've seen the operating experience variances exceeding ZAR 1 billion for the first time. All our businesses achieved positive risk experience, as well as positive persistency experience. It's an ongoing trend. A very pleasing trend for us. And then the minus number, the ZAR 1.077 billion, that is really the impact of the higher risk discount rate, the net impact of that. What we do to get to an adjusted number is to exclude the impact of the market. And in the last column, you see that on a normalized and adjusted basis the return was the ZAR 8.5 billion, which is about 11% on the absolute value.\r\nIn summary, I'm very pleased to report that we continue on our strategy. We continue to add shareholder value by focusing on our return on Group Equity Value. Profitable growth on track, as I have mentioned. Our core business performing very well. And we continue to add to that fast-growing, strong growing, growth market business to get us to a 35% growth in the current period. Our diversification strategy is working for us that we can actually absorb less-than-normal performance for us from -- for example, this year from Santam. And then we continue to focus on sound capital management in the group as Johan also mentioned with our focus really to find investment opportunities in growth markets and pleasing in the current year that those newer positions [ph] have immediately started to make quite a sizable contribution to our profit number.\r\nThere's the last slide, if you look at over a longer term, if the gray or the shaded area is our performance hurdle that we've set, the top line shows that we, on a cumulative basis, outperformed that by quite a margin if you start measuring that from the listing of the company in 1998.\r\nWith that, back to Johan for the rest of the presentation.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nThank you, Kobus. Now the results were fairly good. And yesterday at the board meeting, the management continuously wanted to refer back to the results. The board wanted to know more about this year and next year. So let me share a bit of what we need to do this year. On the Personal Finance side, which is the biggest business, it's our retail business, individual businesses in South Africa. The focus there will be, we expect interest rates to rise further. And the focus will be firstly on getting sales and to maintain margins in this market, which will be tougher. The strategy there to achieve that is to grow the adviser force in all the market segments. We would like, particularly in the emerging -- in the lower end of the market, the entry-level market in our Sanlam Sky business, add quite a bit to that adviser force. Also, in the middle market. And then we have a strategy also from people who don't like the added regulation and FAIS legislation would rather be in the umbrella of a bigger brother or sister to -- and will abandon being an independent. So there's a whole strategy there to grow the adviser force in all the segments. There's a big focus on product innovation, particularly in the recurring premium area. I think we fell behind a little bit. We had big, big IT renovations. We renewed our new platform last year and the year before. So we fell a bit behind. And so there's a whole pipeline of new products being launched and coming on board. And while we've been doing extremely well, the one area where we've been lagging in the personal lines business and the individual business in South Africa has been the recurring premiums, where most of our peers have been growing. So we're trying to get back to that. There's a big focus on that, particularly the risk business, getting the right premiums in and growing there. In the Sanlam Sky broker channel, you would have seen that we didn't grow as we wanted there. In fact, we've gone a little bit backwards. Now partly that is because of the economic pressure some of the brokers are under in the lower end of the market. But also, it's been partly because of our increased, I think, hurdles -- the higher hurdles that we have for taking business on board. We're not taking business from people who are overly indebted and things like that. And so we've struggled in this market a little bit. So there's a whole strategy around that where we can support our brokers there through training and a range of other issues to write sustainable business there. The second part that we have to do in this market is, you would have seen the tight economic conditions that we've been referring you to. And you would have seen the slight up-tick in lapse rates and things like that, Section 14 transfers out of the book and so forth. We'll be basing tremendous focus, like in the past, still the focus but heightening our efforts to keep business on the book. And increasingly, there's no point in writing business if it's to disappear 2 or 3 years down the line. So we're doing a lot to get persistency back to where we are happy with it. I want to stress that we're well within our assumption levels in what we assume, but we'll have to do something there, given particularly the industrial action that we've seen and other things that simply make it easier for people to churn the business. There will be a continued focus on operational inefficiency and cost management. I think this business has to be commended on the increase in cost -- in the cost base across this business. The inflation rate has been about 5.8%  [indiscernible].  Overall, the costs in this business increased by around 5% or so. It's a tremendous effort in a tough environment where there's -- particularly on getting and retaining good people, and so you have to pay more. We've seen the deterioration in the currency impacting particularly on IT costs. We are heavily into IT here. We spend around ZAR 1 billion, ZAR 1.2 billion a year in this business, but really managing that whole cost efficiency will be a key thing. Because this is a South African business, dealing with individuals, it is important that we also get the transformation thing going there and retaining the emphasis on that. I'm very pleased to announce that we also got our new certificate on our performance in terms of our broad-based black economic empowerment performance, our scorecard, which was audited and approved also the day before yesterday. We're a Level 2 provider for the first time. And we're making steady progress on all fronts with respect to transforming the business. And increasingly, the business is reflecting the demographics of South Africa. And lastly, I think there is a big focus on meeting our regulatory obligations, and these are several. In this particular business, it's firstly about treating customers fairly. TCF is embedded in all our processes, from the board level right down. We have the reporting in place to really manage everything and every aspect of the business according to the TCF rules and so forth. And we would like to think that we're certainly a leader amongst our peers in that particular area of TCF in South Africa. There is also a big focus on the regulatory capital, on the SAM process. I've already spoken that we've taken a conservative approach with respect to that. We're not going to change our capital massively in this year until we're certain where it's heading. For the moment, we are working hard in playing a full role with respect to those things. And then around the new commissions and the retail, the focus on retail distribution that we have quite a few issues that will impact this business. I think we're well-placed to manage them. And by and large, we think big businesses like ours will benefit from the regulatory changes that we actually see. People will increasingly move away from being on their own, where the regulatory obligations are often onerous. Much rather come into a fold of a bigger company, where there's support and help in order to meet those obligations. Of course, we're not on our own there. Our major peers also have strategy to -- strategies to gain from this. And so we're working hard to be at the front of the pack. If we look at Emerging Markets, they've done extremely well this year. For the first time contributing more than ZAR 1 billion of profit on a net basis. The focus for us will remain on Africa, India and Southeast Asia. And we are not going to change our model. We have a partnership model there, mainly using different brands, which are well-established in these countries. We don't know everything that's going on in these countries. We're reliant on partners to help manage client relations, regulatory relations and a whole range of issues, but up until now it's been working fairly well. And we would like to remain that focus. The big focus for us is rather than to expand just the number of countries that we're in and maybe stretch beyond what we can manage, rather deepen the relationships in the countries where we are. So it's continue on the top line growth, efficiencies and capital optimization within the current operations.\r\nBotswana, becoming more mature really looking at costs. For many years, they have simply focused on the growth component of the business, increasingly as this growth is slowing to also look at more efficiencies.\r\nWithin Shriram, we have 5 businesses there. One of them being a big distribution business to credit businesses, general insurance business, to life insurance businesses, lots of synergies between these businesses. And we've been contributing massively towards unlocking of those synergies, but there's still a lot to do already. There's a number of IT implementations that we have across Africa. As we grow the businesses, the old platforms that these people have -- IT platforms -- suddenly become too small to handle volumes and so forth. We have to upgrade most of the systems. We are busy with upgrades in -- virtually across the board, in Zambia, in Kenya, in Botswana, in Namibia, just to name but a few. So we're supporting those businesses from here in order to do those things. We often find that the skill base not necessarily available in the countries that we deal with, so there's a big dependency on what we can do and the support that we can provide from South Africa. We would like to deepen our existing relationships, bolt-on transactions. So far this year, we announced one particular one. We acquired Oasis General Insurance, together with our partner, First Bank of Nigeria, in Nigeria to complement the Life business. We've been at the Life business 3, 4 years now. It's become a profitable business. It's growing, it's exceeding expectations, so be ready for the next phase and we've added now the General Insurance base, we'll be integrating that, and we'll be growing that. And we'll be doing similar things in other countries in Africa. In India, we're trying to get to the synergies, deepening the relationships. I've gone on to the board of Shriram Capital there to give some input and to help with those processes from the top end. And Malaysia, we're really trying to -- we have a General Insurance business, we'd like to add some Life and Other businesses. We've also announced in December that there's a Santam co-investment agreement. They provide us while -- within some emerging markets we also deal with General Insurance. There's an agreement where they bought an economic stake of 35% of what we have in these countries. And in return for that, they provide us with technical expertise and so. So it's really to bet [ph] that down, and we're recruiting a number of people from Santam that will come across to manage their investment within Sanlam, and to make sure that reinsurance opportunities that do arise from our operations or so are adequately addressed within Santam and are taken care of. So there's a big drive to also create that synergies and help Santam to grow their business. Then organizational capacity to support growth is critically important. As issues arise, we move people from our -- from mainly from our Sanlam Retail business, from our Investment business, from Santam, to come and join the Emerging Markets team to strengthen that. Some on a project basis if we have issues, some others on a more permanent basis, but it's a critical component. And the other issue is the compliance and governance and reporting. We have rigid standards and very high standards in terms of what many of the countries we deal with have been exposed to in the past. So it's quite a journey to make sure that they're reporting the management, the risk management and the other issues that we face within these countries are at the same level in what we have over here in South Africa. So there's an ongoing focus of training, support and in the areas of compliance, reporting and so forth. So that's going fairly well. On the investment side, the focus is firstly to maintain the investment performance, the good performance that we've seen. Most of the value investors struggled in 2012, with momentum investors doing well. We've seen some return to value investments doing better. And last year, you could see it in our results as well, so it's about retaining what we have. Particularly, we have a fixed benchmark. I think a big area for us is to improve institutional fund flows, to improve retail funds flows, where the margins are substantially higher and so. And in order to affect that, we changed the business quite substantially, and separated essentially the product factory, the investment component, from the 2 markets that we have. So we've set up a much more client-centric structure that we will be leveraging off. In addition to that, we will expand our African funds proposition. We already have an African property fund. We would like to develop our African debt fund in there. We have an African equity fund, listed equity fund, and we have other 2 opportunities; not only with our own money, but increasingly to draw money in there and so forth. And once or twice, you get a setback -- some of our people have been locked up just before the weekend for not having the right visa. The people behind the counter ran out of time, and the last 5 people and the people, they just said well, we don't have time for you guys. You have to sleep in our facility here overnight. Not the greatest kind of accommodation you'll get from that. But overall, things are going fairly well. Cost effective solution across the value chain, critical. We bought Satrix, it's doing well. Optimizing the active versus passive management business models, I think we're doing that fairly well at the moment. We need to do much better on the passive side. We've paid a fair amount for Satrix. But we think, in South Africa in particular, that there's still scope for the ETF -- for that whole ETF space to grow quite substantially. And then this business depends very much on what happens in the Retail business. It depends a lot on what happens in other areas of Sanlam. And I think there's a lot of improvement that we can make in terms of collaboration and efficiencies. We don't -- we get small amounts of our own flows into the Retail business. If you look at the bigger picture, into our own Investment business, I think we can do better there. In Santam, the story there is quite clear. It's been a tough 2 years. I'm very happy with the progress that we're making in getting the premium increases through, in doing better risk underwriting and so forth. And already last year, as opposed to 2012, we were much better and had smaller exposure to particularly [ph]  These hailstorms and several of the floods and so forth, through deliberate actions that we've taken in this business. I think growth is important in this business. We've seen market diversification, we have a few special projects in place there: The investment in the Sanlam Emerging Market partners. Santam RE [ph]; the Specialist businesses and then MiWay, which has really been making a tremendous contribution towards growth in the personal lines market. The size and quality of the risk pool, we do much better. We're really addressing a whole range of things there. There are a number of key projects that we're implementing to better underwrite on a scientific way. Up until now, it's been major groups and so forth. We have a project in that. We would like to take the scientific underwriting that we follow in the direct model and implement some of the key characteristics of that, also in the personal lines broker market. So we're working on that. There is a big drive through the value chain to get efficiencies going, the focus is on cost. I think we can do much better on the claims side still. We are really optimizing a lot of that, but it's -- it requires a new look, particularly now that the rand is weak, and a lot of what we have to replace is simply imported stuff. And then, we have a number of strategic projects also that I've already mentioned, going through that. So overall, there's more than enough to keep us busy, and we think you know that we can make a tremendous impact for the year. For the outlook for the rest of year, we're getting the improved traction in the developed economies, the twofold impact. It will be supportive of economic activity in Emerging Markets, maybe not immediately. We've already seen there's sort of a year lag when it happens, but we feel a positive that eventually, with the increased traction in developed markets will have a trickle-down effect to ourselves. But more importantly, in the shorter-term, the tapering of quantitative easing will result in volatility in the currency. We think the weakening of the currency has been overdone. The investment market performance is on a high, we're relatively expensive, and we don't necessarily expect the same kind of returns going forward. In fact, we're much more cautious about the future. For us, a big focus is bedding down new acquisitions. We've been investing quite a bit, and we'll be pulling quite a few people from our existing businesses, SPF and so, to strengthen the team that we have within our Emerging Markets business. So making sure that we actually get what we plan. Big issue in South Africa is regulatory. I think it would be the regulatory pressures then changes that we see. Retirement reform is a big issue. You would have heard the Minister of Finance speaking in the budget about costs in retirement form. As an industry, we've agreed that if we can get certain things in place, particularly compulsion, and particularly, if we can keep preservation by keep -- in keeping their retirement funds on the platform, without it being disappearing every 6 months for people moving jobs and so forth, we can drive down cost quite substantially. We'd like to do that. The big beneficiaries will be, of course, the clients, but also businesses like ours, where you get compulsions in countries like Chile and Australia and so forth. Private sector has benefited tremendously from what's happening there. So we really work with the regulatory authorities and particularly Treasury there, to create an environment where everybody is better off. Commission changes, a critical thing for us, because it affects the people that we deal with. We're working on that, fees, independence, tied agents and these kinds of things. So it may have some impact on us. I think we're really well placed with the models that we have in place. This year, I've already spoken about, it is finalizing our approaches and making sure that the stuff is bedded down and properly entrenched, and then the big, sort of, \r\n[Audio Gap]\r\na few questions still around Solvency Assessment and Management, which is all around capital. We think there will be more clarity on how it will impact us. We're busy with Quest 3 [ph], and once we have the results of those, we can again, a gauge on the results on the industry, and how it will impact the industry and so forth. So quite a few things. Ladies and gentlemen, and that brings the end to our story. I think in summary, very good results. As team, we've been together for quite a while. I've been with, as you know, I think, it's the 11th time, 11th year that I've been up here, reporting on our performance. Certainly within the life and savings industries, it's the best performance that we've had. We've been carried many years by Santam. This year, we were able to carry them. And in spite of what's been happening there, we're pretty proud of the results, and we think it's fairly solid. I would like to open the floor now for questions on a few things, and André, if you and Kobus can join us, there on the chairs, I'd really appreciate that. If you have a question, please put up your hand. People will get to you with the microphone and then introduce yourself and we -- and fire away.",
      "transcript_text3": "I'm a bit like a hare in a spotlight here. I can't see too well. There's a question there. Risto?\n\n---\n\nYes, hi, it's Risto from Standard Bank. Two questions. The first one is, I would like to know whether the board debated a special dividend? And if yes, what was the pros and cons of going with a substantial increase, normal dividend instead? The second question's a bit more technical. You mentioned that there's 1 or 2 major issues in SAM outstanding. Could you maybe expand on what the major issues are, and what's the relevance of those to Sanlam?\n\n---\n\nOkay. I think the first one on the special dividend, the board every year, over the past 10 years, have debated the issue of a special dividend. Because we've always had surplus capital, the issue was, do we invest it in other opportunities and so forth? We don't see the normal dividend and the special dividend being related to at all. Because the normal dividend simply refers to the cash flow of our operations in that given year. And we tried to pay out as much as possible, with a steady sort of an increase, with a dividend coverage of around 1.1. And that is how we arrived at the dividend, the normal dividend of ZAR 2. So it's supported by the cash flow from the business, and what we expect into the future, and that will be rising. The special dividend simply refers to the ZAR 4 billion of surplus cash that we have available, and then we measure that amount relative to the opportunities that we have, share buybacks or investing more into shares of our partners and the partnering businesses, what sort of return can we get on that? Investing into new business growth, or returning it to shareholders? We think we have a good pipeline of projects and available opportunities for the ZAR 4 billion that we have that justifies not paying a special dividend. And the timeframe of that is such that in the foreseeable future that we'll be able to spend the ZAR 4 billion. That was the sort of board decision, and how we derived that. The previous year, we paid a special dividend, where we had 4.2 surplus. We saw a good pipeline, but we knew that some of the projects would be further down the line. We'll be adding capital to that. And instead of sitting on the surplus, we've decided to pay a special dividend of ZAR 0.50, which is around ZAR 1 billion. Not a massive number, but steady. This year, we think there are other opportunities with higher sort of returns, like the stuff that you've been seeing. So that's the special dividend story. Kobus, would you like to add anything?\n\n---\n\nNo, I agree with you, and I think that's exactly the point.\n\n---\n\nI'm happy that we think the same.\n\n---\n\nMust I take the same question? I think in general, as the basis developed up to now, I think we can live with it, in general terms. There's a couple of things that's been tested in Quest 3[ph]. And after we've seen the industry results, some decisions will be taken about that. I think for us, probably the major one-off, the items that's tested is, whether you allow any diversification benefit for participations. And as you know, I mean, since we are a diversified group, we have big participations in Santam, things like that. So I think that will have an impact on how big the cover level will be in the end. I don't think it will be crucial this way or that way, but it will impact on sort of the, how the numbers will look.\n\n---\n\nYes, and just to give a bit more, I think flesh to André's answer there, we don't necessarily have to get any diversification benefits from the SAM process. But as a business, we'll just say, over and above that, with this amount of capital, because we're well diversified, we don't think we have to have the same cover as a business that doesn't have that. So -- and we'll specify that ourselves in looking at the capital. As we understand the process, there's enough room for that, so that's why André says it doesn't really matter on this side or that side. But in the end, optics do drive a lot of the process, and we have to understand what's going on. We don't want to be seen as having lower capital available as some of our peers and therefore being more risky. And those are the kinds of issues that we'll have to debate and address. At this moment in time, there are a number of issues that are simply up in the air. We would expect more, with our -- with the FSB people being here, working with us on SAM. They understand where we're going and we're in this together. We see that also as a partnership. Another question?\n\n---\n\nMorning, Johan. Larissa from Barclays. Your -- in your Emerging Market businesses, we saw relatively modest growth compared to some of what we've seen in prior years on the present value of sales. But your margin increased quite nicely, it went from 5.6 to 7.4. And then we also saw quite a nice bump in the new business profits. Can you maybe give us a little bit of color as to which countries and which products are really coming through that affected that?\n\n---\n\nKobus, would you like to?\n\n---\n\nI think, as I've indicated, I mean the -- we did see substantial growth on the recurring Premium Life business, in most of the areas where we saw those products, and that reflects in the increase in the value for new business as well. And what you should now realize that what we report is a combination of investment business, short-term business and life business in those numbers. So it is -- that just -- will distort it somewhat. And in particular, where we saw bulky single premium business, it also distorts the year-on-year comparison of the overall number, in particular in Namibia, where we had very low-margin new [ph] trust business, that is no longer in that, in the comparison, so. But the profitable business, the Recurring Life business is really what reflects in the value of new business  [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\nYes, and in the areas that we would like to continue and focus on like exactly, the new Life Recurring business and particularly the risk part of it, where we do -- are getting healthy margins, that part has been growing very, very well. Across the board. Any other question? Great. Do we have anybody? No questions, then? Nothing? What is left then is to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for attending. We really appreciate your support. We work hard during the year to produce a set of numbers. It's been a pleasure to share that with you. We're very proud of what has been achieved in the past year. We think it will be a tough act to follow in this coming year, but we have a few, few things up our sleeve -- sleeves, and I think we're well set to continue on this journey. In particular, I think the strategy is fairly robust. We're well diversified in terms of regions, we're well diversified in terms of how we reach clients, not only intermediated, although it's still the main focus, but we have direct businesses. We have group schemes. We have affinity businesses. We're in different areas and markets in South Africa. We've been able to increase our footprint, and so forth. So overall, in terms of products, methodology of distribution, market segment and so forth, we feel pretty good that we can weather a lot of the storms we see coming our way. Always a few jokers in the pack, in particularly regulation. Increasingly we see the things that we get in the U.K., spilling over to South Africa. In fact, many of the policies are simply copied and implemented here, or at least discussed from that level. I think we have a good working relationship, together with the rest of the industry, to try and make and create then, a good business that's better for clients in the first, for customers. But also for the businesses, if they do the right stuff. And we're fairly confident and happy with the progress that's been made, and so we look forward to another set of good results for this year. Thank you for the support.",
      "transcript_text4": "【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nI'm a bit like a hare in a spotlight here. I can't see too well. There's a question there. Risto?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Risto Ketola (Analysts)】\nYes, hi, it's Risto from Standard Bank. Two questions. The first one is, I would like to know whether the board debated a special dividend? And if yes, what was the pros and cons of going with a substantial increase, normal dividend instead? The second question's a bit more technical. You mentioned that there's 1 or 2 major issues in SAM outstanding. Could you maybe expand on what the major issues are, and what's the relevance of those to Sanlam?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nOkay. I think the first one on the special dividend, the board every year, over the past 10 years, have debated the issue of a special dividend. Because we've always had surplus capital, the issue was, do we invest it in other opportunities and so forth? We don't see the normal dividend and the special dividend being related to at all. Because the normal dividend simply refers to the cash flow of our operations in that given year. And we tried to pay out as much as possible, with a steady sort of an increase, with a dividend coverage of around 1.1. And that is how we arrived at the dividend, the normal dividend of ZAR 2. So it's supported by the cash flow from the business, and what we expect into the future, and that will be rising. The special dividend simply refers to the ZAR 4 billion of surplus cash that we have available, and then we measure that amount relative to the opportunities that we have, share buybacks or investing more into shares of our partners and the partnering businesses, what sort of return can we get on that? Investing into new business growth, or returning it to shareholders? We think we have a good pipeline of projects and available opportunities for the ZAR 4 billion that we have that justifies not paying a special dividend. And the timeframe of that is such that in the foreseeable future that we'll be able to spend the ZAR 4 billion. That was the sort of board decision, and how we derived that. The previous year, we paid a special dividend, where we had 4.2 surplus. We saw a good pipeline, but we knew that some of the projects would be further down the line. We'll be adding capital to that. And instead of sitting on the surplus, we've decided to pay a special dividend of ZAR 0.50, which is around ZAR 1 billion. Not a massive number, but steady. This year, we think there are other opportunities with higher sort of returns, like the stuff that you've been seeing. So that's the special dividend story. Kobus, would you like to add anything?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nNo, I agree with you, and I think that's exactly the point.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nI'm happy that we think the same.\n\n---\n\n【回答: A. Zeeman (Executives)】\nMust I take the same question? I think in general, as the basis developed up to now, I think we can live with it, in general terms. There's a couple of things that's been tested in Quest 3[ph]. And after we've seen the industry results, some decisions will be taken about that. I think for us, probably the major one-off, the items that's tested is, whether you allow any diversification benefit for participations. And as you know, I mean, since we are a diversified group, we have big participations in Santam, things like that. So I think that will have an impact on how big the cover level will be in the end. I don't think it will be crucial this way or that way, but it will impact on sort of the, how the numbers will look.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nYes, and just to give a bit more, I think flesh to André's answer there, we don't necessarily have to get any diversification benefits from the SAM process.

      "transcript_text1": "Okay. So welcome, everybody, here in the first year [indiscernible]. Good afternoon, good morning and good afternoon on the telephone call. This time, I will make sure that I don't make the same mistake as last year because last year there will be the Q&A here, and I forgot that all the people on the phone, and I thank you very much that they finished and then we stopped it and hold the things there. So we will do it properly. \r\nSo the full year results, Kuehne + Nagel 2013, everybody has received or either has it from the press release, the consolidated financial statements. The official annual report will be published in 2 or 3 weeks with the financial statement, unqualified opinion, Ernst & Young, EY, approved by the Board of Directors last week, which also will be the basis for our AGM day file on the fifth or the sixth -- Monday, 5th of May. \r\nAs usual, we will open the exercise with -- by myself with the highlights of the year. We will introduce our new CEO, of which a few of you know Detlef Trefzger already because he was here on the Capital Market Day in September last year, already acting as the CEO in the Nomura building, September 2013. Detlef will go through the business units, sea, air, road and contract logistics performance. He will also tell and present the new team, a major achievement, a major task of our Vice President, Board of Directors, Karl Gernandt was to -- before the end of last year to finalize the succession of the management board, CEO, CFO, successfully done. We're very proud that now Detlef is able to present a new team, clear, average age below 50, and mixture of internal and external. I'm very proud that the breeding within the company of Markus Blanka going through the management development concept of finance and administration Kuehne + Nagel via London, Euribor, Hong Kong and then Corporate Finance has resulted in giving him the opportunity to be my successor, to be the CFO of the future. So we have the outgoing and the incoming CFO here. Very proud that we were able to build that [indiscernible] talent and very important for the stability of the company and the culture -- to maintain the specific culture of the company. You all know how specific Kuehne + Nagel is if you come to cost control, cost management and even in a correcting market environment, we will, of course, never lose that ability.\r\nSo we will have Q&A. First, the Q&A for the participants here in the room and then we will ask. \r\nOkay. Kuehne + Nagel 2013, CHF 20.9 billion revenue. Revenue, we all know, is a mixture of rate, freight rates, currencies, duties and taxes. So therefore, the real key performance indicator parameter will be gross profit CHF 6.2 billion, CHF 6.2 billion coming from CHF 6.15 billion our trade recession year of 2009, up 3%, a little bit of negative currency, mainly the dollar and the U.K. pound, a little bit positive on the euro. \r\nStable working capital, I'll come back to that, and effective tax rate, sustainable effective tax rate between 34 and -- 21% and 22%. \r\nFor the EBITDA, we all know that we have in last year in 2012 booked in airfreight and in the first quarter in the OpEx between gross profit and EBITDA to CHF 65 million [indiscernible], which we booked then and we are now fighting against them about the way of calculation, et cetera, that will take probably a few years to come to an agreement of that, but the payment was booked as an expense. So we should take that, for comparison reasons, we should take it out and I did that during the further analysis. \r\nWhat happens in the year 2013? 2013, the first semester, the first 2 quarters and a different environment, different market environment. And also, Kuehne + Nagel was in a different shape. The corrective actions initiated at the beginning of the year and the markets started in a slow environment, seafreight, airfreight fleet. We saw in the second half the impact of the corrective actions and you know corrective actions in Kuehne + Nagel in sea and air is manpower cost, back office, and contract logistics is consequent execution of Master Location Plan. Detlef will go through that. \r\nWe see here the variances quarter by quarter, I'm on Slide 5. The variances quarter by quarter, you see the decline in the freight rates, especially in Q3, which has an impact -- a negative impact on the revenue. As such, irrelevant -- gross profit is more important. The growth in gross profit is equal although the second semester at the impact of the seasonality of August where we have the traditional little bit. And then we see, if you look at the EBIT figures, we were CHF 4 million better -- CHF 15 million better in Q3 and CHF 29 million better in Q4 year-on-year, making up the fact that the second semester, CHF 40 million better EBIT 6 months year-on-year versus CHF 18 million in the first semester. Very confident that this speed, this environment will continue. \r\nGood morning, UBS asset management. As usual, late.\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nOkay. You still have Kuehne + Nagel shares? Of course, which fetched us 5% dividend yield. Okay. So this is important to see the development first semester year-on-year to last semester, here gross figures were different -- gross figures are different. The last quarter was, in airfreight, 64%, in seafreight, 5% giving us the 3% overall, which was considered already in the Q3 call by Detlef. \r\nSo Detlef will now go through the business development, which he'll start with introducing himself and the new team.\n\n---\n\nAll right. Thanks, Gerard. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Warm welcome also for those that are off-line, online, but remote. It's the third time that I'm able to represent Kuehne + Nagel International to the financial community. And for the last time, I will give some personal statements and then you should know me and should have received my view on the organization. \r\nSo we move on to Page or Slide 7. I'm with the company exactly 1 year, 365 days and I've been CEO now for 0.5 year or a bit more than 0.5 year and what did I do in the last almost 200 days? I went through the organization and met with customers, more than 200 customers, in either customer meetings or in one to one. I went to all the regions. I met with regional representatives of all organization and also with top -- I went to the top 20 countries. At the same time, I also visited warehouses and town hall meetings together with the feeling of what's going on, on shop floor level, what's going on in the markets where we do the operation of our business.\r\nAnd I can reconfirm what I said already at the Capital Market Day, it's a very dynamic, result-oriented organization with an extremely set hierarchy and that also is part of our culture.\r\nWe have a broad product, broad customer base, very loyal customer in the small and medium enterprise area, which we will also collaborate to develop new and innovative solution, targeting at end to end supply-chain-oriented solution, complex logistic and transport solution. We have a strong majority shareholder and investor support in our long-term strategy, so that gives us the security to come to fast decision taking and to implement our strategy in the years to come continuously. And at all levels, it's an entrepreneurial-driven company, and I have to say the litmus test more or less is that we ask ourselves always, would you invest into that with your own money, with your personal money and if you come to a yes, you can do this for the organization as well and that is a bit of spirit in the culture of the organization that has been a success factor in the past and will continue to be one moving forward. And for me personally, as I said months ago, it's almost that I've never worked for anybody else, but for Kuehne + Nagel. The culture is so inspiring and the fit is there, I really appreciate it.\r\nGerard mentioned that we have the management team set up and in place, and I move onto Slide 8, and that is the management team from right to left. I will explain the names and functions once more to you, but the picture is not revealing of the dynamics in the team. So this is a rather undynamic picture and in our next meeting, I can promise you we will come up with a more dynamic picture. We are thinking about it. We have 1 year now left and we are working on that. That doesn't show the dynamic, the interaction and the positive spirit in the management team at all.\n\n---\n\nThat will be because I will not be there. The dynamic then comes back.\n\n---\n\nThe dynamic will come back, for sure. From right to left for you, Otto Schacht on the right side, representing global seafreight. Left of him, Tim Scharwath, representing global airfreight; Stefan Paul for what we call now overland, you will hear more about that from Gerard later. Myself, representing contract logistics and the CEO function. Then Gerard Van Kesteren and already mentioned to you in the back of Gerard is the incoming CFO, Markus Blanka and Gerard is the outgoing CFO, but with his new role in the board. He will stay in close contact with us. But we wanted to show you, it's a seamless transition, and therefore, we have office in the picture and that's important to all of us that, but we have a seamless transition into the new CFO era coming up from this year. Next, looking at the picture, left of Markus, you'll find Lothar Harings for HR and then Martin Kolbe for IT, and all the data mining and technology-oriented topics. So that's the team. That will be the team moving forward and the team is set. We smile as you see in the picture and next time you'll see how we collaborate and interact.\r\nLet me give you some highlights of our business units and some quick overview on the business units and then follow up with some more details on the respective business units. I'm on Slide 9. Seafreight, we had a moderate growth, moderate growth in seafreight of 2% to 3%. High market rate volatility and very different roles throughout the quarters of the year 2013 on the different trade lanes. You know already that we increased our volume by 3% in total. We have a stable turnover and gross profit and we were able to also keep our conversion rate at 30% in that volatile market environment. You will see the details on the next slide. \r\nAirfreight, the speculating market. We were -- see rates declining in most trade lanes, overcapacity in the market led to a rate decline, continuous rate decline. We were able, through our focused products and solution approach, to increase our volume by 4% or 41,000 tons last year and at the same time had our GP margin per 100 kilo stable, that's also important for us. That led to a conversion rate even higher than the targeted 25% last year, above the 25% at 25.3%. \r\nRoad & Rail, in the future overland, the market stable, maybe slightly decreasing, last year 0% to minus 2% negative growth. While we were consolidating our business and also reviewed customer contracts and customer activities, our net turnover went down by 3%. And at the same time, you see that, that led also to profitability increase, the gross profit increased by 2%. The EBIT is still negative, but it improved by 50% and if you see the details in a couple of minutes, the quarter over quarter performance show that we are on the right track in restructuring and growing our road business again.\r\nContract logistics, also here, for the last 5 times -- 5 years, a very low market growth by only 2%. We have a very strong competitive environment, especially in Western Europe and high pressure on solutions for those [ph] rates. We were able to increase our net turnover by 4.5% and we improved significantly the bottom line with the effects of the initiated Master Location Plan condescend [ph] implementation of that plan, at the same time, also that was the effect on the topline growth or generated the effect on the topline growth. We have a focus growth program started where we very selectively look for solutions that we can scale into other markets for the same customers. All that led to a bottom line increase that we will comment -- that I will comment on later on. \r\nSo that's the overview. For highlights of the business units, we move onto Slide 10. Seafreight, turnover stable with almost CHF 9 billion in revenue. We have a currency effect or impact here of almost CHF 200 million that we had to swallow, a negative currency impact and at the same time, the gross profit is stable. And as you see, the EBIT and percentage of the gross profit, what we call conversion rates, stabilized at 30%. \r\nIf you look at the bottom left of the slide, you see how the quarter performance went and the weak first semester Q1 and Q2 was overcompensated, clearly, a strong Q3 and Q4 figures in total, especially with Q4 figures were very promising with regards to volume growth. So another 5,000 TEU more shipped last year, stable gross profit margin and the conversion rate also stable at 30%. And as we have mentioned already at the Capital Market Day, we have still impact of the projects, oil and gas business. The projects have expired or are expiring. We are filling the pipeline again. We are successful on the market, but you will not see any traction of that in the figures operational before 2015 because the time to market for our project, oil and gas, was 18 to 24 months usually or even -- sometimes even longer.\r\nOur container business and that's the important topic and message to all of you is stable and with the LCL product, which we have successfully implemented decades ago, we see operationally a lot of growth and also profitable growth. \r\nMoving onto airfreight on Slide 11. The airfreight business unit was able to increase the turnover by 2%. Also here, we have some currency effects included, negative currency effects included that were compensated. Gross profit by 5%, that for sure is the effect of our solution-oriented approach with perishable, but also with the solutions in the pharma or engine chain sector for aviation, aerospace. The EBIT increased by 9% -- 9.4%, including the effect or excluding the onetime effect of the penalty paid last year. So that we were even able, despite the growth in a flat market environment, to increase the conversion rate from 24.3% to 25.3%. And the volume spike or increase you saw in Q4 2013 on the bottom slide -- bottom part of the slide -- of Slide 11, at the same time, also the conversion rate coming with the volume was very, very positive. In total, the gross profit per 100 kilos, stable over the last year, was different developments throughout the quarters.\r\nRoad & Rail, mentioned before, slight reduction in turnover. Here, we have no currency effect, no significant currency effect. But more important, the gross profit, we were able to increase the gross profit by 1.7%. And it's still loss making, but we are on the right track. We have reduced the losses by 50%. And if you look directly to the right bottom side of the slide, you see the quarter-over-quarter development, why we were behind 2012 in Q1 2013, that was very much influenced by the bad weather conditions, lots of snow in January, February north of the Alps, north-south of the Alps, what we have this year experienced this year. And at the same time, then a warming up of the temperature heavily in March with a lot of floodings, if you remember, half of the area, northeast area was flooded, the border-crossing [indiscernible] were almost impossible to get through. So there was a severe impact on land traffic induced by weather, but not only in 2013 and the first quarter. And from the second quarter onwards, you see that our new strategy wrote the profit of traction and the performance is clearly better than in previous -- in the respective quarter of the previous year. And in Q4, you saw that we were even positive in the quarterly results and had a significant increase of positive deviation throughout the fourth quarter 2012. \r\nIn total, the -- our assessment for overland is that given this sequence of the quarters and the volume development as well as the bottom line effect, we are on the right track with the restructuring program, quite a lot of profit.\r\nI move onto Slide 13, which is contract logistics. And net turnover increased by 4.5%, gross profit margin, 3.3%, and almost 50% of the additional gross profit converted into bottom line effect and EBIT increase of 49%. \r\nIf you look at the EBITDA development quarter by quarter, we came from 3.2% EBITDA in Q4 2012, stable at 3.8% EBITDA in Q1 and Q -- 2013 and then we were able to improve the EBITDA margin quarter by quarter in the second semester, and that is, first of all, an effect of the consequence implemented Master Location Plan, but also of new project wins in our new solution-oriented growth trend that started to pay off into bringing the right complexity and solutioning requirements of our customers into contract logistics. \r\nThe quarter by quarter EBIT development, you see on the right bottom side of the slide and in all quarters, we were outperforming 2012, clearly, with a spike and a nice run rate for the fourth quarter 2013 and that is also a volume effect in our existing business. We saw more volume throughput in the third and fourth quarter 2013 compared to previous year.\r\nSo that's the growth through -- the details on the business units. Gerard will now comment on the financial figures, followed by the outlook.\n\n---\n\nThank you very much. So quickly go through the financial review cash flow balance sheet, et cetera. So here we see on Slide 15, income statement. We had 23% net profit after tax improvement, however, influenced by one-off CHF 65 million. If we would exclude that, we will have a 9% increase, its [indiscernible] to CHF 65 million. That is in a way what we -- with moderate volume growth figures, productivity improvement compared to EBIT target, okay. I'll come back on the dividend later on. \r\nYou see a very strong balance sheet, no debt, 40% equity in percent of the total, cash and cash equivalents, almost CHF 1.3 billion. CapEx, between CHF 180 million and CHF 200 million, in line with our guidance. \r\nBalance sheet of Kuehne + Nagel, no debt. We see specifically the intangibles, the CFS accounting principles we are adopting in respect of the group of companies we are acquiring, being allocated where possible to customize and be confidential, and then the intangibles are then written off, amortized over a certain period. We are doing, therefore, you see here a reduction in December 2012 on Slide 16, 141, up to 89. I have scheduled the next page where it goes in 2 years, there are in no intangibles anymore. Under the assumption, no acquisitions are there, they will take place to both as [indiscernible]. The group will, the different [indiscernible] is a pure translation differences in respect of currency and we are impaired, we do the impairment tests on an annual basis, the intangibles see impairment test on a property basis.\r\nYou see that balance sheet, the trade receivables are the most important part and our working capital definition is trade receivables minus payables, those two and accrued trade payables. We don't take other short-term provisions. If we would do that, then we will have negative working capital. \r\nHere, you see the development of the intangibles in the P&L account on Slide 17 for the next few years by business unit. The amount in 2013 was CHF 58 million charged to the P&L account and cash impact moved from the balance sheet assets into the amortization. And you see in 2016, we will have a CHF 40 million improvement of the EBIT due to the written off of the capitalized intangibles: Seafreight, airfreight, road, overland here is the main thing, and in contract logistics. So we did it in purpose for your models so you can take that into consideration.\r\nCash flow. We have a cash flow improvement of almost CHF 200 million, and that sits with the cash conversion rate I prepared with the schedule. Here, the cash conversion rate on Slide 19 where we were able, in the year 2013, with a tax and tax equivalent improvement of almost CHF 200 million, add back to dividend, CHF 419 million dividend was paid in 2013, representing the payout ratio of 75% of the 2012 result after tax. And then we would have cash conversion of about 100%, and that is exactly what the business model of Kuehne + Nagel is. The profit after tax, after minorities, CHF 607 million minus 10 5 97 [ph], should be before dividends, 100% represented in the increase of the cash position. That is that we are aiming for. That is another key performance indicator in order to make sure the reconciliation between the cash improvement versus the reported profit after tax.\r\nCash flow, coming from 1.5 -- CHF 1.1 billion from operations. The net CapEx on Slide 20, dividend payments in 2013 out of the results 2012 and the CHF 1.3 billion by the end of the year. \r\nWorking capital, working capital is stable in the last 3 years at year end, approximately CHF 600 million, giving us a working capital intensity between 3.1% or 3.2%, that is working capital as a percentage of the annualized revenue, so that means the revenue goes up indeed than the working capital requirement as a part of the balance sheet. And the revenue might go up or down based on volume and rates -- freight rates. \r\nWe were able to go back to the 9 days between DSO and DPO, which existed in December 2011, 8 days in December 2012, and now we are back on 9 days, the difference between DSO and DPO. Very strong working capital management at profit center level, at branch, at country and in corporate. This is an important part of the Kuehne + Nagel key performance indicators, you know. In our freight forwarding business, we have volume, margin, conversion rate and working capital, cash conversion.\r\nDevelopment of dividend. I made a little slide on Slide #21. The development of the dividend during the last 5 years based on the normal dividend. We changed, we increased our payout ratio a few years ago from 50% to 75%, representing then a -- on Slide 21 an ordinary dividend in 2009 of CHF 2.30 per Kuehne + Nagel share. We have 120 million shares so that, that generates then a cash outflow of CHF 273 million in 2009. Then it went up to CHF 3.85, CHF 3.50 and, this year, again, CHF 3.85, which represents 75% of the profit after tax of the minorities. And an extra dividend of CHF 2 per share, CHF 120 million, i.e., a dividend, an extra dividend of CHF 240 million, representing almost then -- representing a payout ratio of 118%. \r\nWhy are we doing that? We have no big M&A plans. Some of you I told you already that we have an M&A well prepared. It takes one for every 2 weeks and it takes 5 minutes because it is so well prepared, right. We have an M&A department reporting to Detlef in person and that's it, finish. And we have agreed that the best and the most sustainable growth is organic growth. We have invested in 2011 CHF 175 million in acquisitions, in 2012, CHF 50 million, CHF 70 million and in 2013, CHF 1 million. So there is no need to have a too big cash flow available. The key structure is there in order to finance the growth. And for the Kuehne + Nagel profit after tax, the extra dividend, the cash outflow as a result of that will have no impact on the result. So we see here the highest dividend ever from a payout ratio and in absolute terms as well. \r\nReturn on capital employed, you know, that is the EBIT of the group versus the invested capital or assets minus all liabilities, excluding cash and excluding equity. Back to the above 50% for the full year, this is an annualized quarter, 5 full quarters, 4 quarters, 4 quarters, 4 quarters, so we have a 53% return on capital employed and 100% cash conversion ratio. \r\nFinancial targets for 2014, full year targets and guidance by business unit comes from Detlef. Profitability conversion rates, sea and air, stable, 30%, 25%. You might say this is typical Kuehne + Nagel, yes, this is typical Kuehne + Nagel. \r\nWorking capital, we stay -- we stick for the 3.5% to 4%, although the year end, it was 3.1%, 3.2%. It fluctuates during the year. There is some seasonality in there that we feel rather comparable and I feel very comfortable to give you my target to Markus, 3.5% to 4%. \r\nCapEx, normal, no funny thing, no extraordinary thing. The balance is the P&L charge for depreciation and amortization is approximately CHF 200 million per year, so that is in [indiscernible] We will amend the segment reporting slightly, instead of having 6 business units, what we are doing now, what we're -- how we are presenting now, which is also in your consolidated annual report. We will reduce it to 4. But we have real estate, which we will ask to contract logistics, and we will have Nacora Insurance Broker, which is a small profitable unit, mainly for Marine insurance, and we will report it externally to include it in seafreight. So that means you have 2 business units less in your model. For comparison reasons, at the back -- at the Annex on page -- on Slide 33, we have adjusted '9, '10, '11, '12, '13 for those 2 business units if you want to use that. We just added insurance broker to see a real estate to contract logistics.\r\nInternally, of course, we have a far more detailed segment reporting, not only 2 business units, but seafreight we have import, export, we have that freight line et cetera to manage our business of course. \r\nTax is a sustainable between 21% and 22% at this year. Before Detlef starts with the volume, indication by business unit and then we will continue with the Q&A. In the appendix, we have on Slide 28, the upcoming events, which is our normal company timetable, including the Annual General Meeting on the May 6 -- the 6th of May, already and we are planning in September, our Capital Market Day. Then we have, as usual, on Slide 30 and 31, the very detailed, key data sheet giving you by business unit P&L account volumes, the year-on-year percentage comparison, an absolute comparison as a service to you. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Gerard. So let's come to the outlook for this year by business unit, volume versus market, our estimate of the markets development. \r\nSlide 25, on the right side of the slide, the block 2014 estimate. Seafreight, we expect the market and it's our expectation to grow at 2% to 4%. Our trend, our target is to grow 1.5x markets. There are different figures in the market. As you know, North [ph] had a press conference last, its Thursday. They announced volume growth expectations of 6% to 7%. We will see whoever has -- is correct with that estimate. We plan to outperform the market business sector of 1.5x. \r\nAirfreight, we see a slight increase in market growth again 1% to 3%. Also, here we want to outperform the market with the sector of 1.5x. \r\nOverland, Road & Rail formerly, overland in 2014 and onwards, we expect slight growth in overland 1% to 3% for 2014. Here, we plan to grow at markets level, our restructuring of the portfolio is finished and we want to grow the business again. \r\nAnd in contract logistics, you see also a slight growth in the market again of 2% to 3%, while we won't grow double market in 2014. \r\nAnd this is the presentation based on the slides. So, I would like to open now the Q&A, and for that, we will start with those here in the room. I will address my microphone and we'll get close to you, don't be afraid of that. And after the Q&A in the room, we will open then the line for those listening remote to the presentation.\n\n---\n\nTobias?",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Gerard Van Kesteren (Executives)】\nOkay. So welcome, everybody, here in the first year [indiscernible]. Good afternoon, good morning and good afternoon on the telephone call. This time, I will make sure that I don't make the same mistake as last year because last year there will be the Q&A here, and I forgot that all the people on the phone, and I thank you very much that they finished and then we stopped it and hold the things there. So we will do it properly. \r\nSo the full year results, Kuehne + Nagel 2013, everybody has received or either has it from the press release, the consolidated financial statements. The official annual report will be published in 2 or 3 weeks with the financial statement, unqualified opinion, Ernst & Young, EY, approved by the Board of Directors last week, which also will be the basis for our AGM day file on the fifth or the sixth -- Monday, 5th of May. \r\nAs usual, we will open the exercise with -- by myself with the highlights of the year. We will introduce our new CEO, of which a few of you know Detlef Trefzger already because he was here on the Capital Market Day in September last year, already acting as the CEO in the Nomura building, September 2013. Detlef will go through the business units, sea, air, road and contract logistics performance. He will also tell and present the new team, a major achievement, a major task of our Vice President, Board of Directors, Karl Gernandt was to -- before the end of last year to finalize the succession of the management board, CEO, CFO, successfully done. We're very proud that now Detlef is able to present a new team, clear, average age below 50, and mixture of internal and external. I'm very proud that the breeding within the company of Markus Blanka going through the management development concept of finance and administration Kuehne + Nagel via London, Euribor, Hong Kong and then Corporate Finance has resulted in giving him the opportunity to be my successor, to be the CFO of the future. So we have the outgoing and the incoming CFO here. Very proud that we were able to build that [indiscernible] talent and very important for the stability of the company and the culture -- to maintain the specific culture of the company. You all know how specific Kuehne + Nagel is if you come to cost control, cost management and even in a correcting market environment, we will, of course, never lose that ability.\r\nSo we will have Q&A. First, the Q&A for the participants here in the room and then we will ask. \r\nOkay. Kuehne + Nagel 2013, CHF 20.9 billion revenue. Revenue, we all know, is a mixture of rate, freight rates, currencies, duties and taxes. So therefore, the real key performance indicator parameter will be gross profit CHF 6.2 billion, CHF 6.2 billion coming from CHF 6.15 billion our trade recession year of 2009, up 3%, a little bit of negative currency, mainly the dollar and the U.K. pound, a little bit positive on the euro. \r\nStable working capital, I'll come back to that, and effective tax rate, sustainable effective tax rate between 34 and -- 21% and 22%. \r\nFor the EBITDA, we all know that we have in last year in 2012 booked in airfreight and in the first quarter in the OpEx between gross profit and EBITDA to CHF 65 million [indiscernible], which we booked then and we are now fighting against them about the way of calculation, et cetera, that will take probably a few years to come to an agreement of that, but the payment was booked as an expense. So we should take that, for comparison reasons, we should take it out and I did that during the further analysis. \r\nWhat happens in the year 2013? 2013, the first semester, the first 2 quarters and a different environment, different market environment. And also, Kuehne + Nagel was in a different shape. The corrective actions initiated at the beginning of the year and the markets started in a slow environment, seafreight, airfreight fleet. We saw in the second half the impact of the corrective actions and you know corrective actions in Kuehne + Nagel in sea and air is manpower cost, back office, and contract logistics is consequent execution of Master Location Plan. Detlef will go through that. \r\nWe see here the variances quarter by quarter, I'm on Slide 5. The variances quarter by quarter, you see the decline in the freight rates, especially in Q3, which has an impact -- a negative impact on the revenue. As such, irrelevant -- gross profit is more important. The growth in gross profit is equal although the second semester at the impact of the seasonality of August where we have the traditional little bit. And then we see, if you look at the EBIT figures, we were CHF 4 million better -- CHF 15 million better in Q3 and CHF 29 million better in Q4 year-on-year, making up the fact that the second semester, CHF 40 million better EBIT 6 months year-on-year versus CHF 18 million in the first semester. Very confident that this speed, this environment will continue. \r\nGood morning, UBS asset management. As usual, late.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Unknown Attendee (Attendees)】\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Gerard Van Kesteren (Executives)】\nOkay. You still have Kuehne + Nagel shares? Of course, which fetched us 5% dividend yield. Okay. So this is important to see the development first semester year-on-year to last semester, here gross figures were different -- gross figures are different. The last quarter was, in airfreight, 64%, in seafreight, 5% giving us the 3% overall, which was considered already in the Q3 call by Detlef. \r\nSo Detlef will now go through the business development, which he'll start with introducing himself and the new team.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Detlef Trefzger (Executives)】\nAll right. Thanks, Gerard. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Warm welcome also for those that are off-line, online, but remote. It's the third time that I'm able to represent Kuehne + Nagel International to the financial community. And for the last time, I will give some personal statements and then you should know me and should have received my view on the organization. \r\nSo we move on to Page or Slide 7. I'm with the company exactly 1 year, 365 days and I've been CEO now for 0.5 year or a bit more than 0.5 year and what did I do in the last almost 200 days? I went through the organization and met with customers, more than 200 customers, in either customer meetings or in one to one. I went to all the regions. I met with regional representatives of all organization and also with top -- I went to the top 20 countries. At the same time, I also visited warehouses and town hall meetings together with the feeling of what's going on, on shop floor level, what's going on in the markets where we do the operation of our business.\r\nAnd I can reconfirm what I said already at the Capital Market Day, it's a very dynamic, result-oriented organization with an extremely set hierarchy and that also is part of our culture.\r\nWe have a broad product, broad customer base, very loyal customer in the small and medium enterprise area, which we will also collaborate to develop new and innovative solution, targeting at end to end supply-chain-oriented solution, complex logistic and transport solution. We have a strong majority shareholder and investor support in our long-term strategy, so that gives us the security to come to fast decision taking and to implement our strategy in the years to come continuously. And at all levels, it's an entrepreneurial-driven company, and I have to say the litmus test more or less is that we ask ourselves always, would you invest into that with your own money, with your personal money and if you come to a yes, you can do this for the organization as well and that is a bit of spirit in the culture of the organization that has been a success factor in the past and will continue to be one moving forward. And for me personally, as I said months ago, it's almost that I've never worked for anybody else, but for Kuehne + Nagel. The culture is so inspiring and the fit is there, I really appreciate it.\r\nGerard mentioned that we have the management team set up and in place, and I move onto Slide 8, and that is the management team from right to left. I will explain the names and functions once more to you, but the picture is not revealing of the dynamics in the team. So this is a rather undynamic picture and in our next meeting, I can promise you we will come up with a more dynamic picture. We are thinking about it. We have 1 year now left and we are working on that. That doesn't show the dynamic, the interaction and the positive spirit in the management team at all.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Gerard Van Kesteren (Executives)】\nThat will be because I will not be there. The dynamic then comes back.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Detlef Trefzger (Executives)】\nThe dynamic will come back, for sure. From right to left for you, Otto Schacht on the right side, representing global seafreight. Left of him, Tim Scharwath, representing global airfreight; Stefan Paul for what we call now overland, you will hear more about that from Gerard later. Myself, representing contract logistics and the CEO function. Then Gerard Van Kesteren and already mentioned to you in the back of Gerard is the incoming CFO, Markus Blanka and Gerard is the outgoing CFO, but with his new role in the board. He will stay in close contact with us. But we wanted to show you, it's a seamless transition, and therefore, we have office in the picture and that's important to all of us that, but we have a seamless transition into the new CFO era coming up from this year. Next, looking at the picture, left of Markus, you'll find Lothar Harings for HR and then Martin Kolbe for IT, and all the data mining and technology-oriented topics. So that's the team. That will be the team moving forward and the team is set. We smile as you see in the picture and next time you'll see how we collaborate and interact.\r\nLet me give you some highlights of our business units and some quick overview on the business units and then follow up with some more details on the respective business units. I'm on Slide 9. Seafreight, we had a moderate growth, moderate growth in seafreight of 2% to 3%. High market rate volatility and very different roles throughout the quarters of the year 2013 on the different trade lanes. You know already that we increased our volume by 3% in total. We have a stable turnover and gross profit and we were able to also keep our conversion rate at 30% in that volatile market environment. You will see the details on the next slide. \r\nAirfreight, the speculating market. We were -- see rates declining in most trade lanes, overcapacity in the market led to a rate decline, continuous rate decline. We were able, through our focused products and solution approach, to increase our volume by 4% or 41,000 tons last year and at the same time had our GP margin per 100 kilo stable, that's also important for us. That led to a conversion rate even higher than the targeted 25% last year, above the 25% at 25.3%. \r\nRoad & Rail, in the future overland, the market stable, maybe slightly decreasing, last year 0% to minus 2% negative growth. While we were consolidating our business and also reviewed customer contracts and customer activities, our net turnover went down by 3%. And at the same time, you see that, that led also to profitability increase, the gross profit increased by 2%. The EBIT is still negative, but it improved by 50% and if you see the details in a couple of minutes, the quarter over quarter performance show that we are on the right track in restructuring and growing our road business again.\r\nContract logistics, also here, for the last 5 times -- 5 years, a very low market growth by only 2%. We have a very strong competitive environment, especially in Western Europe and high pressure on solutions for those [ph] rates. We were able to increase our net turnover by 4.5% and we improved significantly the bottom line with the effects of the initiated Master Location Plan condescend [ph] implementation of that plan, at the same time, also that was the effect on the topline growth or generated the effect on the topline growth. We have a focus growth program started where we very selectively look for solutions that we can scale into other markets for the same customers. All that led to a bottom line increase that we will comment -- that I will comment on later on. \r\nSo that's the overview. For highlights of the business units, we move onto Slide 10. Seafreight, turnover stable with almost CHF 9 billion in revenue. We have a currency effect or impact here of almost CHF 200 million that we had to swallow, a negative currency impact and at the same time, the gross profit is stable. And as you see, the EBIT and percentage of the gross profit, what we call conversion rates, stabilized at 30%. \r\nIf you look at the bottom left of the slide, you see how the quarter performance went and the weak first semester Q1 and Q2 was overcompensated, clearly, a strong Q3 and Q4 figures in total, especially with Q4 figures were very promising with regards to volume growth. So another 5,000 TEU more shipped last year, stable gross profit margin and the conversion rate also stable at 30%. And as we have mentioned already at the Capital Market Day, we have still impact of the projects, oil and gas business. The projects have expired or are expiring. We are filling the pipeline again. We are successful on the market, but you will not see any traction of that in the figures operational before 2015 because the time to market for our project, oil and gas, was 18 to 24 months usually or even -- sometimes even longer.\r\nOur container business and that's the important topic and message to all of you is stable and with the LCL product, which we have successfully implemented decades ago, we see operationally a lot of growth and also profitable growth. \r\nMoving onto airfreight on Slide 11. The airfreight business unit was able to increase the turnover by 2%. Also here, we have some currency effects included, negative currency effects included that were compensated. Gross profit by 5%, that for sure is the effect of our solution-oriented approach with perishable, but also with the solutions in the pharma or engine chain sector for aviation, aerospace. The EBIT increased by 9% -- 9.4%, including the effect or excluding the onetime effect of the penalty paid last year. So that we were even able, despite the growth in a flat market environment, to increase the conversion rate from 24.3% to 25.3%. And the volume spike or increase you saw in Q4 2013 on the bottom slide -- bottom part of the slide -- of Slide 11, at the same time, also the conversion rate coming with the volume was very, very positive. In total, the gross profit per 100 kilos, stable over the last year, was different developments throughout the quarters.\r\nRoad & Rail, mentioned before, slight reduction in turnover. Here, we have no currency effect, no significant currency effect. But more important, the gross profit, we were able to increase the gross profit by 1.7%. And it's still loss making, but we are on the right track. We have reduced the losses by 50%. And if you look directly to the right bottom side of the slide, you see the quarter-over-quarter development, why we were behind 2012 in Q1 2013, that was very much influenced by the bad weather conditions, lots of snow in January, February north of the Alps, north-south of the Alps, what we have this year experienced this year. And at the same time, then a warming up of the temperature heavily in March with a lot of floodings, if you remember, half of the area, northeast area was flooded, the border-crossing [indiscernible] were almost impossible to get through. So there was a severe impact on land traffic induced by weather, but not only in 2013 and the first quarter. And from the second quarter onwards, you see that our new strategy wrote the profit of traction and the performance is clearly better than in previous -- in the respective quarter of the previous year. And in Q4, you saw that we were even positive in the quarterly results and had a significant increase of positive deviation throughout the fourth quarter 2012. \r\nIn total, the -- our assessment for overland is that given this sequence of the quarters and the volume development as well as the bottom line effect, we are on the right track with the restructuring program, quite a lot of profit.\r\nI move onto Slide 13, which is contract logistics. And net turnover increased by 4.5%, gross profit margin, 3.3%, and almost 50% of the additional gross profit converted into bottom line effect and EBIT increase of 49%. \r\nIf you look at the EBITDA development quarter by quarter, we came from 3.2% EBITDA in Q4 2012, stable at 3.8% EBITDA in Q1 and Q -- 2013 and then we were able to improve the EBITDA margin quarter by quarter in the second semester, and that is, first of all, an effect of the consequence implemented Master Location Plan, but also of new project wins in our new solution-oriented growth trend that started to pay off into bringing the right complexity and solutioning requirements of our customers into contract logistics. \r\nThe quarter by quarter EBIT development, you see on the right bottom side of the slide and in all quarters, we were outperforming 2012, clearly, with a spike and a nice run rate for the fourth quarter 2013 and that is also a volume effect in our existing business. We saw more volume throughput in the third and fourth quarter 2013 compared to previous year.\r\nSo that's the growth through -- the details on the business units. Gerard will now comment on the financial figures, followed by the outlook.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Gerard Van Kesteren (Executives)】\nThank you very much. So quickly go through the financial review cash flow balance sheet, et cetera. So here we see on Slide 15, income statement. We had 23% net profit after tax improvement, however, influenced by one-off CHF 65 million. If we would exclude that, we will have a 9% increase, its [indiscernible] to CHF 65 million. That is in a way what we -- with moderate volume growth figures, productivity improvement compared to EBIT target, okay. I'll come back on the dividend later on. \r\nYou see a very strong balance sheet, no debt, 40% equity in percent of the total, cash and cash equivalents, almost CHF 1.3 billion. CapEx, between CHF 180 million and CHF 200 million, in line with our guidance. \r\nBalance sheet of Kuehne + Nagel, no debt. We see specifically the intangibles, the CFS accounting principles we are adopting in respect of the group of companies we are acquiring, being allocated where possible to customize and be confidential, and then the intangibles are then written off, amortized over a certain period. We are doing, therefore, you see here a reduction in December 2012 on Slide 16, 141, up to 89. I have scheduled the next page where it goes in 2 years, there are in no intangibles anymore. Under the assumption, no acquisitions are there, they will take place to both as [indiscernible]. The group will, the different [indiscernible] is a pure translation differences in respect of currency and we are impaired, we do the impairment tests on an annual basis, the intangibles see impairment test on a property basis.\r\nYou see that balance sheet, the trade receivables are the most important part and our working capital definition is trade receivables minus payables, those two and accrued trade payables. We don't take other short-term provisions. If we would do that, then we will have negative working capital. \r\nHere, you see the development of the intangibles in the P&L account on Slide 17 for the next few years by business unit. The amount in 2013 was CHF 58 million charged to the P&L account and cash impact moved from the balance sheet assets into the amortization. And you see in 2016, we will have a CHF 40 million improvement of the EBIT due to the written off of the capitalized intangibles: Seafreight, airfreight, road, overland here is the main thing, and in contract logistics. So we did it in purpose for your models so you can take that into consideration.\r\nCash flow. We have a cash flow improvement of almost CHF 200 million, and that sits with the cash conversion rate I prepared with the schedule. Here, the cash conversion rate on Slide 19 where we were able, in the year 2013, with a tax and tax equivalent improvement of almost CHF 200 million, add back to dividend, CHF 419 million dividend was paid in 2013, representing the payout ratio of 75% of the 2012 result after tax. And then we would have cash conversion of about 100%, and that is exactly what the business model of Kuehne + Nagel is. The profit after tax, after minorities, CHF 607 million minus 10 5 97 [ph], should be before dividends, 100% represented in the increase of the cash position. That is that we are aiming for. That is another key performance indicator in order to make sure the reconciliation between the cash improvement versus the reported profit after tax.\r\nCash flow, coming from 1.5 -- CHF 1.1 billion from operations. The net CapEx on Slide 20, dividend payments in 2013 out of the results 2012 and the CHF 1.3 billion by the end of the year. \r\nWorking capital, working capital is stable in the last 3 years at year end, approximately CHF 600 million, giving us a working capital intensity between 3.1% or 3.2%, that is working capital as a percentage of the annualized revenue, so that means the revenue goes up indeed than the working capital requirement as a part of the balance sheet. And the revenue might go up or down based on volume and rates -- freight rates. \r\nWe were able to go back to the 9 days between DSO and DPO, which existed in December 2011, 8 days in December 2012, and now we are back on 9 days, the difference between DSO and DPO. Very strong working capital management at profit center level, at branch, at country and in corporate. This is an important part of the Kuehne + Nagel key performance indicators, you know. In our freight forwarding business, we have volume, margin, conversion rate and working capital, cash conversion.\r\nDevelopment of dividend. I made a little slide on Slide #21. The development of the dividend during the last 5 years based on the normal dividend. We changed, we increased our payout ratio a few years ago from 50% to 75%, representing then a -- on Slide 21 an ordinary dividend in 2009 of CHF 2.30 per Kuehne + Nagel share. We have 120 million shares so that, that generates then a cash outflow of CHF 273 million in 2009. Then it went up to CHF 3.85, CHF 3.50 and, this year, again, CHF 3.85, which represents 75% of the profit after tax of the minorities. And an extra dividend of CHF 2 per share, CHF 120 million, i.e., a dividend, an extra dividend of CHF 240 million, representing almost then -- representing a payout ratio of 118%. \r\nWhy are we doing that? We have no big M&A plans. Some of you I told you already that we have an M&A well prepared. It takes one for every 2 weeks and it takes 5 minutes because it is so well prepared, right. We have an M&A department reporting to Detlef in person and that's it, finish. And we have agreed that the best and the most sustainable growth is organic growth. We have invested in 2011 CHF 175 million in acquisitions, in 2012, CHF 50 million, CHF 70 million and in 2013, CHF 1 million. So there is no need to have a too big cash flow available. The key structure is there in order to finance the growth. And for the Kuehne + Nagel profit after tax, the extra dividend, the cash outflow as a result of that will have no impact on the result. So we see here the highest dividend ever from a payout ratio and in absolute terms as well. \r\nReturn on capital employed, you know, that is the EBIT of the group versus the invested capital or assets minus all liabilities, excluding cash and excluding equity. Back to the above 50% for the full year, this is an annualized quarter, 5 full quarters, 4 quarters, 4 quarters, 4 quarters, so we have a 53% return on capital employed and 100% cash conversion ratio. \r\nFinancial targets for 2014, full year targets and guidance by business unit comes from Detlef. Profitability conversion rates, sea and air, stable, 30%, 25%. You might say this is typical Kuehne + Nagel, yes, this is typical Kuehne + Nagel. \r\nWorking capital, we stay -- we stick for the 3.5% to 4%, although the year end, it was 3.1%, 3.2%. It fluctuates during the year. There is some seasonality in there that we feel rather comparable and I feel very comfortable to give you my target to Markus, 3.5% to 4%. \r\nCapEx, normal, no funny thing, no extraordinary thing. The balance is the P&L charge for depreciation and amortization is approximately CHF 200 million per year, so that is in [indiscernible] We will amend the segment reporting slightly, instead of having 6 business units, what we are doing now, what we're -- how we are presenting now, which is also in your consolidated annual report. We will reduce it to 4. But we have real estate, which we will ask to contract logistics, and we will have Nacora Insurance Broker, which is a small profitable unit, mainly for Marine insurance, and we will report it externally to include it in seafreight. So that means you have 2 business units less in your model. For comparison reasons, at the back -- at the Annex on page -- on Slide 33, we have adjusted '9, '10, '11, '12, '13 for those 2 business units if you want to use that. We just added insurance broker to see a real estate to contract logistics.\r\nInternally, of course, we have a far more detailed segment reporting, not only 2 business units, but seafreight we have import, export, we have that freight line et cetera to manage our business of course. \r\nTax is a sustainable between 21% and 22% at this year. Before Detlef starts with the volume, indication by business unit and then we will continue with the Q&A. In the appendix, we have on Slide 28, the upcoming events, which is our normal company timetable, including the Annual General Meeting on the May 6 -- the 6th of May, already and we are planning in September, our Capital Market Day. Then we have, as usual, on Slide 30 and 31, the very detailed, key data sheet giving you by business unit P&L account volumes, the year-on-year percentage comparison, an absolute comparison as a service to you. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Detlef Trefzger (Executives)】\nThanks, Gerard. So let's come to the outlook for this year by business unit, volume versus market, our estimate of the markets development. \r\nSlide 25, on the right side of the slide, the block 2014 estimate. Seafreight, we expect the market and it's our expectation to grow at 2% to 4%. Our trend, our target is to grow 1.5x markets. There are different figures in the market. As you know, North [ph] had a press conference last, its Thursday. They announced volume growth expectations of 6% to 7%. We will see whoever has -- is correct with that estimate. We plan to outperform the market business sector of 1.5x. \r\nAirfreight, we see a slight increase in market growth again 1% to 3%. Also, here we want to outperform the market with the sector of 1.5x. \r\nOverland, Road & Rail formerly, overland in 2014 and onwards, we expect slight growth in overland 1% to 3% for 2014. Here, we plan to grow at markets level, our restructuring of the portfolio is finished and we want to grow the business again. \r\nAnd in contract logistics, you see also a slight growth in the market again of 2% to 3%, while we won't grow double market in 2014. \r\nAnd this is the presentation based on the slides. So, I would like to open now the Q&A, and for that, we will start with those here in the room. I will address my microphone and we'll get close to you, don't be afraid of that. And after the Q&A in the room, we will open then the line for those listening remote to the presentation.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Gerard Van Kesteren (Executives)】\nTobias?",
      "transcript_text3": "I have 4 questions if I may. Firstly, on the targets. You get that impressive chart on how your conversion has improved, so adding the CHF 35 million gross profit in last quarter and you added CHF 30 million EBIT, and I think that's what the market would like to see from you, when you grow next year, but then looking at your margin targets, working capital targets is over peak like, no real margin improvement, not much of operating leverage. Are you just being conservative or is there anything that you haven't told us in this P&L.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's the first question and my first answer is that I haven't stated that we are conservative. I think, we have a conservative assessment and that is maybe also the philosophy moving into the next couple of years. We focus on conversion rate, and we confirm to conversion rates for seafreight is 30%, and for airfreight is 25%, and that is what's drives our growth and conversion of potentials. First question.\n\n---\n\nSecond. I'd like to question of progress on road or ask you to provide a little more arguments on that because when I look at EBITDA, it's actually down year-over-year, and the improvement comes mostly from a little depreciation or amortization. What are the troubles that you need to fix, why are you confident that it will get structurally better and return at cost of capital being perceptive over the next 2, 3 years.\n\n---\n\nRight, you saw the gross profit development and that is important, that we grew in gross profit again, and we have -- we went through all these, we're taking European growth business model outside of Europe activity, we have increased prices a lot. So we will get full traction of the price increases with the growth that we see in 2014. The percentage figure is dependent on the customer, because of the customer and distribution. We have also 3 different products, or product segments. One is the groupage network you will focus on international trade on and on domestic. Domestic we try to procure and manage the process growth, while we have a FTL/LTL business that is fundable and growing faster at the moment. And in addition, and more important a solution-oriented topics, like in connection with KN PharmaChain, the distribution of, collection of pharma products, as well as the high-value product distribution that we see a lot of traction in the market as well.\n\n---\n\nAnd third question. Seafreight, some of your competitors grew much faster in the fourth quarter, and most of 2013, you've been a bit more cautious on growth versus margin. Do you think that development in the market will continue that aggressiveness on private company competitors, or do you think that it eases. How do you feel the world here?\n\n---\n\nOur competitors about there price policy, our policy is clear, we stated it, we don't induce and foster  the price work. We try to stabilize our margin and our conversion rate, and we were, especially in the first semester, extremely selective with our business, that continues as we saw more opportunities in the second semester. And as the market leader, we shouldn't start the price aggressiveness at all.\n\n---\n\nWe will have a fourth one. Okay, on contract logistics, just a very general question since you're the expert in the market really, 2% growth is much and basically from all the big top level data, you suggest that the industry should grow 5%, 6%, 7% because of outsourcing and market growth, and is there anything structural that hampers growth at this point and when we should it's going to react.\n\n---\n\nYes, that's a very good question for me, that is really unprecedented. If you take all the prices here, usually we have 5%, 6% growth in this market, or 4% to 6%. We expect that to come back, at the moment, we have Western Europe, that is extremely cautious, very often or we have some industries that are changing the business model, and that are also enforcing, enforcing trends in some economy because we have legal guarantees that become effective and then customers are [ph] operate in [indiscernible] or the other [ph] cost on living, due to stop wages, but as they have committed for labor, to be employed that is for them the only solution. At the same time, we see growth again in North America, but under very a lot of margin pressure, so we have selective here as well. And then Asia, we see that outsourcing continues and that's even the evolution of outsourcing is not taking place like in Western Europe in the past, but that they come to high-end, very complex and very immediately transfer somewhere in the Western Europe or Southern Europe or North America. Other questions?\n\n---\n\nNeil Glynn from Crédit Suisse. If I can ask the last 3 questions, and firstly, with respect to your ocean volume guidance for 2014. Can you give us some in final terms of how the first quarter is looking, just to put in context, what you're, where you pitching things looking for the full year.\n\n---\n\nThe basis of our, figures that we have just shown those volume expectation is based on the experience also, that we made in January, February for every month. I will talk about the figures of the first quarter, I think it's 14 or 16 or is it?\n\n---\n\n14.\n\n---\n\n14, so you will get the details there. But it's the basis obviously, what we experienced in Feb.\n\n---\n\nUnderstood, and just in terms of the project business. I guess it was a contributor to the weakness in pricing for the fourth quarter. Can you help us think about how meaningful to overall good level profitability the project business is. And also help us thinking about how pricing -- Can you protect pricing in 2014 based on what you're thinking?\n\n---\n\nWe don't disclose segment information. So that the segment as you know business positive, we don't disclose those details, but at the same time, project business has a lead time for market of 18, 24, 30 months, very often, you win a project, but we don't see volumes go shipments, ship to say, before 1 or 3 years are gone. And so we would expect -- we expect more traction in projects oil and gas, again in 2015 onwards.\n\n---\n\nAre we best to think about pricing GP per toy, GP per kilo, as broadly flat for 2014, or you -- any more ambitious from that?\n\n---\n\nWe have a conversion rate target and that guides our selection process and the market activity and our sales force is having that in demand in the hunt volumes, so to say.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And just one final question. Just on contract logistics, you just exceeded a 4.6% margin in the fourth quarter, which is obviously quite impressive. What do you think happens in 2014, or even beyond? Can we get that margin from an annual 4% up to 5%, or even beyond?\n\n---\n\nYes, you know that, our internal target is 5% EBITDA margin, and I can only confirm from today's perspective that we will get there. We will follow the Master Location Plan until the end of this year, after the Master Location Plan like the restructuring approach, and at the same time with our new focus growth program, where we select solutions, scale solutions and implement them for our customers. We believe that the top line and gross profit development and picking as such. So I'm confident that we will eventually in the next 24 months, show a sustainable 5% EBITDA margin.\n\n---\n\nPenny Butcher from Morgan Stanley. I just have the one question in relation to both air and sea on the capacity side. What are your latest views as to what you're seeing based on the ship line side and the airlines with regards to capacity in '14? I guess, that's the other potential squeeze on GP that you may say?\n\n---\n\nRight. Capacity is increasing still. So we have the big ships moving in reflecting about the 18,000 TEU last year by another 6%, went -- led to another 6% capacity increase. At the same time, and that is putting pressure on the margin and volatility of the margin. The operational cost of those ships per TEU go on dramatically. So the incremental contribution of an additional TEU leads to maybe margin and pricing, and that will have a great effect as well. Different markets, but the similar effects in the airfreight, the airfreight markets through the many of the through the passenger see that is increasing heavily or maybe due to the Middle East area introducing new [indiscernible], not 1 or 2, but the hundreds [indiscernible]. We can have a significant effect on the varying capacity, and that also lead us to moment to rather deterioration of the margin. In overland in Europe, we still have an overcapacity and with have high costs in the operations due to the restrictions or leader conditions in domestic distribution and we still have a driver capacity before that's drive us that also lead to either capacity or cost effects. All of that leads to or say the unpredictable margins. And if you look back to 2013, we have in 2013, 3x last year the 44 [ph] below USD 1,000, and 2x about USD 3,000 and all that happened within 2, 3, 4 weeks, and so then very difficult to predict. More questions? Yes? Michael.\n\n---\n\nThis is Michael Foeth, Bank Vontobel. Just one question on the special dividend. How did you come up with the CHF 2 number, it seems to me that your nice problem of having excessive cash is going to be recurring. Why is it not more than CHF 2?\n\n---\n\nAt the moment, I think we feel comfortable and that is up to the general assembly to decide with the CHF 2. Also, as Gerard said, we want to keep up our fire power in the market. Although, the M&A meetings are only 5 minutes, take only make 5 minutes, Gerard said [indiscernible] and we are still looking at the targets. We don't expect a big target to be part of our portfolio in the next month. But to compliment our refer or [indiscernible] story or our solution expertise in certain areas, we've always insured that be ready to acquire a profitable and interesting kind of company.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Maybe just a second question, on your networking capital. It looks like, you were able to reestablish the DPO level. Is that -- I mean, is that sustainable? Your guidance suggests that you are expecting networking capital intensity to go up, so maybe just not really sustainable, or maybe the DSO pressure is going to increase going forward. Can you maybe just comment on how you manage to increase DPOs ?\n\n---\n\nYou have too effectivity and more pressure you said in the market and sometimes you wonder why you just putting focus on that every couple of [indiscernible] as well. At DPO, we have programs running, where we offer solution off to our suppliers and therefore, we believe that this is a sustainable figure.\n\n---\n\nYes, of course, right. This is a permanent fight obviously with customers and with suppliers, but we launched a couple of programs on the supplier side, we have been financing of the -- we offer supply financing together with [indiscernible] and quite a success going through the last couple of months. And that's how we try to manage our DPO side. The DSO side of thing is far more emotional part of it because or the customer side, you have to make choices between profitability, working capital, volume so there is all basket of decisions to make. And I'm very happy that we are still maintaining our weekly, biweekly meetings on that because I think that none of us would like to make that decision to do. Okay, I like that customer because [ph] and I like the opportunity to then half versus 4 to 5 to 6 today. We really have to have this [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\nIf there are no more questions, 1 more questions, 2 more questions in the room, then we will go to the.\n\n---\n\nMay be just a small question, Daniel [indiscernible]  Can you capture that additional growth without incurring much cost?\n\n---\n\nWe have prepared for that, therefore we gave the sector rather than percentage in our outlook for 2014. We are prepared for more growth.\n\n---\n\nAnd on the seafreight volume, which was quite strong -- Torsten Wyss from UBS. On the seafreight volume, 5% in Q4. How did the Chinese New Year impact that volume? How do you see that impact in Q1, Chinese New Year, which was early this year. And then on the airfreight volume, the 5% obviously a strong in the last fourth quarters and strong quarter, but the guidance into 2014 is similar like in the past years. So what exactly is the difference so to speak Q4, which was better versus the same guidance as in the past. Is it really Q4 being different or is the guidance just as you said overly cautious?\n\n---\n\nThe good thing is that Chinese New Year is always in the first quarter of the year, but you're right, it was 2 weeks earlier, 31st of January what the main day for that and we saw some effect on volumes effect for sure I hear to Christmas. Can we expected, we can't no, but there are for sure some volumes there. But as we said before, the volume expectation was made based on the January, February figures that we saw, so we feel confident that some of the momentum that we saw in Q4 2013 was -- is carrying over to this year as well. If you look into our market estimation in general, we believe that we are more -- a bit more optimistic even if we are still conservative than a year ago for 2013, and that is the result of not only Q4, but also Q3. There was certain development, and especially if you look into the North Atlantic volumes seafreight, airfreight, that is picking up in Asia business is picking up very significantly, and also some of the rates [ph] improving the trends into [indiscernible] is showing volume increases, or have shown that volume increases and no reason to believe that shouldn't go up.\n\n---\n\nI think we'll lets just cut off the room, correct. Then we can open the lines for those from outside.\n\n---\n\nI got 2 questions really. First of all, on overland, can you talk a little bit about what's going on inside the road to profit program as you called it. And where you think you can get that business to in terms of margins in 2 or 3 years?\n\n---\n\nMark, it's Detlef. I can give you some details. I think, I mentioned that before when I went through the highlights of the business unit, and lots of profit, we have 3 segments, we are looking at or areas we're looking at. One is the groupage business and here we clearly focus on international groupage. The line haul business between countries and then connecting that with the domestic product that we purchase. Secondly, we have a strong focus on FTL/LTL with the expert way of using and also procuring the carrier volumes and rates. And thirdly, there's a solution business focusing on pharma, so that the connection with PharmaChain that we do in airfreight, and also partly in contract logistics, as well as security products or inbound manufacturing for the automotive industry. These are the 3 areas. And as I said before, we strongly believe, if you go back on the slide, where we show the quarterly results. We strongly believe, we will get this business into a black figure, not a rocket science to return on EBIT margin, but into a direct figures soon and that will be sustainable.\n\n---\n\nAnd what sort of margin targets, do you have for the business 2 or 3 years down the road?\n\n---\n\nMark, we concentrate on the turning it into black figures and then we can discuss about margin. But at the moment, we have to turn the business that is long lasting, loss making into black figures and I'm very confident that Stefan Paul and his team will be successful soon.\n\n---\n\nWe always as a company, long-term CHF 4 billion, CHF 5 billion revenue and it has [ph] for intangibles 2.5%, that has been at that time the goal long term, and we should not deviate from that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And my second question that you talked about the capital markets and you mentioned again today, that you're trying to sort of focus the business around more integrated, complicated logistics solutions, more cross-selling. From the evidence that you've seen in the last 6 months since you've been the CEO, when you do that sort of business. Are you getting properly paid for it, is the market prepared to pay for that complexity?\n\n---\n\nDefinitely. We are not talking about a commercial modest size solution, we are talking about solutions that only a few of our peers in the market can provide and not only offer, but operate on a sustainable basis, and that is exactly the confidence that we will put focus on in the months and years ahead of us.\n\n---\n\nA couple of questions and let me give them to you once. First of all, just looking at Q4, the SG&A cost per unit handle both in air and ocean on fell as volumes picked up. Can you give us a feel about, what you think the natural run rate of growth of the business would be without any adding any new structural SG&A cost to the air and ocean business. How have fast could you grow off the existing cost base and gets operating leverage before you have to put cost in? And then the second question, just coming back to dividend, when the board thought about the special dividend. Can you update us a little bit more about how you thought about future capital allocation in the business? You already said or hinted you have minimum cap M&A ambitions. The business still generates cash. How did the board think about the long-term prospects for capital allocation?\n\n---\n\nOkay. I'm not sure, I understood the second question because we you were interrupted a bit. But to answer the first question, SG&A our target is to minimum compensate for inflationary costs, like the normal label costs or other cost increases, that's the minimum target. And we tried in the past and were a successful with that and we will continue that to outperform, or to be 1% or a bit better in that respect.\n\n---\n\nRemember that during the quarterly review calls with you in 2013, we aimed for and we communicated that the second semester in sea and air OpEx will not exceed the first semester. And that has been the actual situation. In our secondary, we don't show SG&A by business unit, we only show difference between gross profit and EBITDA and out of that, 70% has been our cost. We always have that in our target, indeed, we have inflation of 1.5%, 1% to 1.5% in sea and air. But the first 2%, 3% volume growth must come from productivity improvements, no increase in FTEs in C&A for the first 2% to 3% of revenue. Could you repeat the second question.\n\n---\n\nYes, absolutely. When you're setting the special dividend for this year, you're still a company that's generating cash. It sounds like that doesn't seem to be much M&A ambition. How did the board discuss and think about the longer-term capital allocation prospects for the group?\n\n---\n\nThere is no long-term plan on that. We were focusing on this year's dividend plan.\n\n---\n\nOther than that, we have a tender term, 75% payout ratio. If we have 100% cash convergence by the end of this year, 75% payout ratio, no acquisitions then the cash flow will increase by CHF 200 million every year, and that cannot be long term our objective.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So would that also mean you wouldn't roll out M&A in the long term if something came along that looks attractive?\n\n---\n\nWe are looking at the targets. As I said before, the M&A meetings are short. We have to look into potential target, at the same time, we have to question ourselves what is the benefit of acquiring it like time-to-market, time-to-solution, and can we not build or grow that ourselves and at the moment, we don't see attractive markets in the market -- attractive targets in the market.\n\n---\n\nI just wanted to know a little bit more about your airfreight ticking. January was -- hasn't reported been yet, but January was likely up 5%, substantially better than the fourth quarter. You're implying that your industry view is 1% to 3%, because that's what you're saying the industry will grow by this year. So I'm curious, why you think it's much less than what it appears to be?\n\n---\n\nWe don't comment on January, David. I don't know where you got your secret figures from. We were focusing on 2013, which offset market in 2013, and we expect for the first time after 24 months growth again in that market, and that is the general market growth 1% to 3%, or between 1% to 3%. Why that is clearly different on different trade lanes. We expect to outperform that market again on my last slide by a factor of 1.5. I hope that answers your question. I hope that I answer your question.\n\n---\n\nThe 1% to 3% growth as of [ph] for this year is not based on January and February actual numbers?\n\n---\n\nIt's based on January, Feb, but our estimate, so into that as well, it's a forecast for 2014, it's not a monthly figure that we just put into box here. So it's our forecast over the next 10 months to come, including the actual figures Jan, Feb that we know.\n\n---\n\nI've got 3, if I may. First of all, just on the airfreight business that the gross profit per sum was very weak in Q4, irrespective of the currency that you measured it in. Could you provide some color on why that was, please. And also to what extent, we should expect that to continue into 2014?\n\n---\n\nOkay, that is the fourth quarter is the peak season and what you see, you have to fight to get volumes even if your volume guarantees, as you have to pay for it. The rates are totally different in Q4 than they are in the normal run.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So the second question is it on the networking capital guidance of 3.5% to 4%. Obviously, that's not consistent with what we saw during Q1 to Q3 of last year, but significantly higher than 3.1%, we saw at the end of Q4. Just to be absolutely clear on this, are you guiding for a deterioration in the networking capital or none? It sounds like it a potential question, it does have quite a significant invocation for cash flow.\n\n---\n\nRobert, this is Markus. Listen, certainly, a year end position for working capital is always be different during the year. And there is clearly, that's why we didn't corridor of between 3.5% and 4% which we achieve every single month to stay within that corridor. There's also seasonality to that, as you could imagine and some of your working capital naturally driven by rate. So when rates go up, there's going to be a higher working capital needs, and when we are going on low rates. So combined that altogether, second and third -- sorry, third and fourth quarter, we'll actually give a higher level of working capital, until we reach the December, where like every other company of our size, will stop payment to be supplied [indiscernible] before year end. But it's going to be very [indiscernible] is that answer the question.\n\n---\n\nOkay. But just to be absolutely clear here, when we are forecasting the end of 2014, it sounds like what you're saying that we shouldn't be assuming a deterioration beyond the 3.1%, we have seen at the end of Q4, 2013. Is that fair?\n\n---\n\nI think, I'm not going to make a statement here 3.1% or 3.3%, but it's going to be in that range.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Just one final question on the that the tax range Q4, it was very low at about 17.5%. Can you just provide a comment on why that was, please?\n\n---\n\nWe were growing during the first 9 months, 72% and we did -- we reconciliation, we doing on monthly basis anyway but the [indiscernible] negative surprised us and the 21% for the full year 2013 is sustainable also for next year. The rate is the corridor but not on the same 21, 22 [ph] but for the full year 2013, with 71% we have sufficient provisions to hack our full year profit.\n\n---\n\nThank you very much. And we close the conference. See you again, or hear you again for the Q1 call. Bye-bye.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Tobias Sittig (Analysts)】\nI have 4 questions if I may. Firstly, on the targets. You get that impressive chart on how your conversion has improved, so adding the CHF 35 million gross profit in last quarter and you added CHF 30 million EBIT, and I think that's what the market would like to see from you, when you grow next year, but then looking at your margin targets, working capital targets is over peak like, no real margin improvement, not much of operating leverage. Are you just being conservative or is there anything that you haven't told us in this P&L.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Detlef Trefzger (Executives)】\nOkay, that's the first question and my first answer is that I haven't stated that we are conservative. I think, we have a conservative assessment and that is maybe also the philosophy moving into the next couple of years. We focus on conversion rate, and we confirm to conversion rates for seafreight is 30%, and for airfreight is 25%, and that is what's drives our growth and conversion of potentials. First question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tobias Sittig (Analysts)】\nSecond. I'd like to question of progress on road or ask you to provide a little more arguments on that because when I look at EBITDA, it's actually down year-over-year, and the improvement comes mostly from a little depreciation or amortization. What are the troubles that you need to fix, why are you confident that it will get structurally better and return at cost of capital being perceptive over the next 2, 3 years.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Detlef Trefzger (Executives)】\nRight, you saw the gross profit development and that is important, that we grew in gross profit again, and we have -- we went through all these, we're taking European growth business model outside of Europe activity, we have increased prices a lot. So we will get full traction of the price increases with the growth that we see in 2014. The percentage figure is dependent on the customer, because of the customer and distribution. We have also 3 different products, or product segments. One is the groupage network you will focus on international trade on and on domestic. Domestic we try to procure and manage the process growth, while we have a FTL/LTL business that is fundable and growing faster at the moment. And in addition, and more important a solution-oriented topics, like in connection with KN PharmaChain, the distribution of, collection of pharma products, as well as the high-value product distribution that we see a lot of traction in the market as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tobias Sittig (Analysts)】\nAnd third question. Seafreight, some of your competitors grew much faster in the fourth quarter, and most of 2013, you've been a bit more cautious on growth versus margin. Do you think that development in the market will continue that aggressiveness on private company competitors, or do you think that it eases. How do you feel the world here?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Detlef Trefzger (Executives)】\nOur competitors about there price policy, our policy is clear, we stated it, we don't induce and foster  the price work. We try to stabilize our margin and our conversion rate, and we were, especially in the first semester, extremely selective with our business, that continues as we saw more opportunities in the second semester. And as the market leader, we shouldn't start the price aggressiveness at all.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tobias Sittig (Analysts)】\nWe will have a fourth one. Okay, on contract logistics, just a very general question since you're the expert in the market really, 2% growth is much and basically from all the big top level data, you suggest that the industry should grow 5%, 6%, 7% because of outsourcing and market growth, and is there anything structural that hampers growth at this point and when we should it's going to react.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Detlef Trefzger (Executives)】\nYes, that's a very good question for me, that is really unprecedented. If you take all the prices here, usually we have 5%, 6% growth in this market, or 4% to 6%. We expect that to come back, at the moment, we have Western Europe, that is extremely cautious, very often or we have some industries that are changing the business model, and that are also enforcing, enforcing trends in some economy because we have legal guarantees that become effective and then customers are [ph] operate in [indiscernible] or the other [ph] cost on living, due to stop wages, but as they have committed for labor, to be employed that is for them the only solution. At the same time, we see growth again in North America, but under very a lot of margin pressure, so we have selective here as well. And then Asia, we see that outsourcing continues and that's even the evolution of outsourcing is not taking place like in Western Europe in the past, but that they come to high-end, very complex and very immediately transfer somewhere in the Western Europe or Southern Europe or North America. Other questions?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Neil Glynn (Analysts)】\nNeil Glynn from Crédit Suisse. If I can ask the last 3 questions, and firstly, with respect to your ocean volume guidance for 2014. Can you give us some in final terms of how the first quarter is looking, just to put in context, what you're, where you pitching things looking for the full year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Detlef Trefzger (Executives)】\nThe basis of our, figures that we have just shown those volume expectation is based on the experience also, that we made in January, February for every month. I will talk about the figures of the first quarter, I think it's 14 or 16 or is it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gerard Van Kesteren (Executives)】\n14.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Detlef Trefzger (Executives)】\n14, so you will get the details there. But it's the basis obviously, what we experienced in Feb.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Neil Glynn (Analysts)】\nUnderstood, and just in terms of the project business. I guess it was a contributor to the weakness in pricing for the fourth quarter. Can you help us think about how meaningful to overall good level profitability the project business is. And also help us thinking about how pricing -- Can you protect pricing in 2014 based on what you're thinking?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Detlef Trefzger (Executives)】\nWe don't disclose segment information. So that the segment as you know business positive, we don't disclose those details, but at the same time, project business has a lead time for market of 18, 24, 30 months, very often, you win a project, but we don't see volumes go shipments, ship to say, before 1 or 3 years are gone. And so we would expect -- we expect more traction in projects oil and gas, again in 2015 onwards.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Neil Glynn (Analysts)】\nAre we best to think about pricing GP per toy, GP per kilo, as broadly flat for 2014, or you -- any more ambitious from that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Detlef Trefzger (Executives)】\nWe have a conversion rate target and that guides our selection process and the market activity and our sales force is having that in demand in the hunt volumes, so to say.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Neil Glynn (Analysts)】\nGreat. And just one final question. Just on contract logistics, you just exceeded a 4.6% margin in the fourth quarter, which is obviously quite impressive. What do you think happens in 2014, or even beyond? Can we get that margin from an annual 4% up to 5%, or even beyond?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Detlef Trefzger (Executives)】\nYes, you know that, our internal target is 5% EBITDA margin, and I can only confirm from today's perspective that we will get there. We will follow the Master Location Plan until the end of this year, after the Master Location Plan like the restructuring approach, and at the same time with our new focus growth program, where we select solutions, scale solutions and implement them for our customers. We believe that the top line and gross profit development and picking as such. So I'm confident that we will eventually in the next 24 months, show a sustainable 5% EBITDA margin.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Penelope Butcher (Analysts)】\nPenny Butcher from Morgan Stanley. I just have the one question in relation to both air and sea on the capacity side. What are your latest views as to what you're seeing based on the ship line side and the airlines with regards to capacity in '14? I guess, that's the other potential squeeze on GP that you may say?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Detlef Trefzger (Executives)】\nRight. Capacity is increasing still. So we have the big ships moving in reflecting about the 18,000 TEU last year by another 6%, went -- led to another 6% capacity increase. At the same time, and that is putting pressure on the margin and volatility of the margin. The operational cost of those ships per TEU go on dramatically. So the incremental contribution of an additional TEU leads to maybe margin and pricing, and that will have a great effect as well. Different markets, but the similar effects in the airfreight, the airfreight markets through the many of the through the passenger see that is increasing heavily or maybe due to the Middle East area introducing new [indiscernible], not 1 or 2, but the hundreds [indiscernible]. We can have a significant effect on the varying capacity, and that also lead us to moment to rather deterioration of the margin. In overland in Europe, we still have an overcapacity and with have high costs in the operations due to the restrictions or leader conditions in domestic distribution and we still have a driver capacity before that's drive us that also lead to either capacity or cost effects. All of that leads to or say the unpredictable margins. And if you look back to 2013, we have in 2013, 3x last year the 44 [ph] below USD 1,000, and 2x about USD 3,000 and all that happened within 2, 3, 4 weeks, and so then very difficult to predict. More questions? Yes? Michael.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Foeth (Analysts)】\nThis is Michael Foeth, Bank Vontobel. Just one question on the special dividend. How did you come up with the CHF 2 number, it seems to me that your nice problem of having excessive cash is going to be recurring. Why is it not more than CHF 2?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Detlef Trefzger (Executives)】\nAt the moment, I think we feel comfortable and that is up to the general assembly to decide with the CHF 2. Also, as Gerard said, we want to keep up our fire power in the market. Although, the M&A meetings are only 5 minutes, take only make 5 minutes, Gerard said [indiscernible] and we are still looking at the targets. We don't expect a big target to be part of our portfolio in the next month. But to compliment our refer or [indiscernible] story or our solution expertise in certain areas, we've always insured that be ready to acquire a profitable and interesting kind of company.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Foeth (Analysts)】\nOkay. Maybe just a second question, on your networking capital. It looks like, you were able to reestablish the DPO level. Is that -- I mean, is that sustainable? Your guidance suggests that you are expecting networking capital intensity to go up, so maybe just not really sustainable, or maybe the DSO pressure is going to increase going forward. Can you maybe just comment on how you manage to increase DPOs ?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Detlef Trefzger (Executives)】\nYou have too effectivity and more pressure you said in the market and sometimes you wonder why you just putting focus on that every couple of [indiscernible] as well. At DPO, we have programs running, where we offer solution off to our suppliers and therefore, we believe that this is a sustainable figure.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Markus Blanka (Executives)】\nYes, of course, right. This is a permanent fight obviously with customers and with suppliers, but we launched a couple of programs on the supplier side, we have been financing of the -- we offer supply financing together with [indiscernible] and quite a success going through the last couple of months. And that's how we try to manage our DPO side. The DSO side of thing is far more emotional part of it because or the customer side, you have to make choices between profitability, working capital, volume so there is all basket of decisions to make. And I'm very happy that we are still maintaining our weekly, biweekly meetings on that because I think that none of us would like to make that decision to do. Okay, I like that customer because [ph] and I like the opportunity to then half versus 4 to 5 to 6 today. We really have to have this [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gerard Van Kesteren (Executives)】\nIf there are no more questions, 1 more questions, 2 more questions in the room, then we will go to the.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Torsten Wyss (Analysts)】\nMay be just a small question, Daniel [indiscernible]  Can you capture that additional growth without incurring much cost?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gerard Van Kesteren (Executives)】\nWe have prepared for that, therefore we gave the sector rather than percentage in our outlook for 2014. We are prepared for more growth.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Torsten Wyss (Analysts)】\nAnd on the seafreight volume, which was quite strong -- Torsten Wyss from UBS. On the seafreight volume, 5% in Q4. How did the Chinese New Year impact that volume? How do you see that impact in Q1, Chinese New Year, which was early this year. And then on the airfreight volume, the 5% obviously a strong in the last fourth quarters and strong quarter, but the guidance into 2014 is similar like in the past years. So what exactly is the difference so to speak Q4, which was better versus the same guidance as in the past. Is it really Q4 being different or is the guidance just as you said overly cautious?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Detlef Trefzger (Executives)】\nThe good thing is that Chinese New Year is always in the first quarter of the year, but you're right, it was 2 weeks earlier, 31st of January what the main day for that and we saw some effect on volumes effect for sure I hear to Christmas. Can we expected, we can't no, but there are for sure some volumes there. But as we said before, the volume expectation was made based on the January, February figures that we saw, so we feel confident that some of the momentum that we saw in Q4 2013 was -- is carrying over to this year as well. If you look into our market estimation in general, we believe that we are more -- a bit more optimistic even if we are still conservative than a year ago for 2013, and that is the result of not only Q4, but also Q3. There was certain development, and especially if you look into the North Atlantic volumes seafreight, airfreight, that is picking up in Asia business is picking up very significantly, and also some of the rates [ph] improving the trends into [indiscernible] is showing volume increases, or have shown that volume increases and no reason to believe that shouldn't go up.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gerard Van Kesteren (Executives)】\nI think we'll lets just cut off the room, correct. Then we can open the lines for those from outside.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark McVicar (Analysts)】\nI got 2 questions really. First of all, on overland, can you talk a little bit about what's going on inside the road to profit program as you called it. And where you think you can get that business to in terms of margins in 2 or 3 years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Detlef Trefzger (Executives)】\nMark, it's Detlef. I can give you some details. I think, I mentioned that before when I went through the highlights of the business unit, and lots of profit, we have 3 segments, we are looking at or areas we're looking at. One is the groupage business and here we clearly focus on international groupage. The line haul business between countries and then connecting that with the domestic product that we purchase. Secondly, we have a strong focus on FTL/LTL with the expert way of using and also procuring the carrier volumes and rates. And thirdly, there's a solution business focusing on pharma, so that the connection with PharmaChain that we do in airfreight, and also partly in contract logistics, as well as security products or inbound manufacturing for the automotive industry. These are the 3 areas. And as I said before, we strongly believe, if you go back on the slide, where we show the quarterly results. We strongly believe, we will get this business into a black figure, not a rocket science to return on EBIT margin, but into a direct figures soon and that will be sustainable.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark McVicar (Analysts)】\nAnd what sort of margin targets, do you have for the business 2 or 3 years down the road?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Detlef Trefzger (Executives)】\nMark, we concentrate on the turning it into black figures and then we can discuss about margin. But at the moment, we have to turn the business that is long lasting, loss making into black figures and I'm very confident that Stefan Paul and his team will be successful soon.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gerard Van Kesteren (Executives)】\nWe always as a company, long-term CHF 4 billion, CHF 5 billion revenue and it has [ph] for intangibles 2.5%, that has been at that time the goal long term, and we should not deviate from that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark McVicar (Analysts)】\nOkay. And my second question that you talked about the capital markets and you mentioned again today, that you're trying to sort of focus the business around more integrated, complicated logistics solutions, more cross-selling. From the evidence that you've seen in the last 6 months since you've been the CEO, when you do that sort of business. Are you getting properly paid for it, is the market prepared to pay for that complexity?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Detlef Trefzger (Executives)】\nDefinitely. We are not talking about a commercial modest size solution, we are talking about solutions that only a few of our peers in the market can provide and not only offer, but operate on a sustainable basis, and that is exactly the confidence that we will put focus on in the months and years ahead of us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Damian Brewer (Analysts)】\nA couple of questions and let me give them to you once. First of all, just looking at Q4, the SG&A cost per unit handle both in air and ocean on fell as volumes picked up. Can you give us a feel about, what you think the natural run rate of growth of the business would be without any adding any new structural SG&A cost to the air and ocean business. How have fast could you grow off the existing cost base and gets operating leverage before you have to put cost in? And then the second question, just coming back to dividend, when the board thought about the special dividend. Can you update us a little bit more about how you thought about future capital allocation in the business? You already said or hinted you have minimum cap M&A ambitions. The business still generates cash. How did the board think about the long-term prospects for capital allocation?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Detlef Trefzger (Executives)】\nOkay. I'm not sure, I understood the second question because we you were interrupted a bit. But to answer the first question, SG&A our target is to minimum compensate for inflationary costs, like the normal label costs or other cost increases, that's the minimum target. And we tried in the past and were a successful with that and we will continue that to outperform, or to be 1% or a bit better in that respect.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gerard Van Kesteren (Executives)】\nRemember that during the quarterly review calls with you in 2013, we aimed for and we communicated that the second semester in sea and air OpEx will not exceed the first semester. And that has been the actual situation. In our secondary, we don't show SG&A by business unit, we only show difference between gross profit and EBITDA and out of that, 70% has been our cost. We always have that in our target, indeed, we have inflation of 1.5%, 1% to 1.5% in sea and air. But the first 2%, 3% volume growth must come from productivity improvements, no increase in FTEs in C&A for the first 2% to 3% of revenue. Could you repeat the second question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Damian Brewer (Analysts)】\nYes, absolutely. When you're setting the special dividend for this year, you're still a company that's generating cash. It sounds like that doesn't seem to be much M&A ambition. How did the board discuss and think about the longer-term capital allocation prospects for the group?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Detlef Trefzger (Executives)】\nThere is no long-term plan on that. We were focusing on this year's dividend plan.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gerard Van Kesteren (Executives)】\nOther than that, we have a tender term, 75% payout ratio. If we have 100% cash convergence by the end of this year, 75% payout ratio, no acquisitions then the cash flow will increase by CHF 200 million every year, and that cannot be long term our objective.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Damian Brewer (Analysts)】\nOkay. So would that also mean you wouldn't roll out M&A in the long term if something came along that looks attractive?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Detlef Trefzger (Executives)】\nWe are looking at the targets. As I said before, the M&A meetings are short. We have to look into potential target, at the same time, we have to question ourselves what is the benefit of acquiring it like time-to-market, time-to-solution, and can we not build or grow that ourselves and at the moment, we don't see attractive markets in the market -- attractive targets in the market.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Campbell (Analysts)】\nI just wanted to know a little bit more about your airfreight ticking. January was -- hasn't reported been yet, but January was likely up 5%, substantially better than the fourth quarter. You're implying that your industry view is 1% to 3%, because that's what you're saying the industry will grow by this year. So I'm curious, why you think it's much less than what it appears to be?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Detlef Trefzger (Executives)】\nWe don't comment on January, David. I don't know where you got your secret figures from. We were focusing on 2013, which offset market in 2013, and we expect for the first time after 24 months growth again in that market, and that is the general market growth 1% to 3%, or between 1% to 3%. Why that is clearly different on different trade lanes. We expect to outperform that market again on my last slide by a factor of 1.5. I hope that answers your question. I hope that I answer your question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Campbell (Analysts)】\nThe 1% to 3% growth as of [ph] for this year is not based on January and February actual numbers?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gerard Van Kesteren (Executives)】\nIt's based on January, Feb, but our estimate, so into that as well, it's a forecast for 2014, it's not a monthly figure that we just put into box here. So it's our forecast over the next 10 months to come, including the actual figures Jan, Feb that we know.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Joynson (Analysts)】\nI've got 3, if I may. First of all, just on the airfreight business that the gross profit per sum was very weak in Q4, irrespective of the currency that you measured it in. Could you provide some color on why that was, please. And also to what extent, we should expect that to continue into 2014?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gerard Van Kesteren (Executives)】\nOkay, that is the fourth quarter is the peak season and what you see, you have to fight to get volumes even if your volume guarantees, as you have to pay for it. The rates are totally different in Q4 than they are in the normal run.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Joynson (Analysts)】\nOkay. So the second question is it on the networking capital guidance of 3.5% to 4%. Obviously, that's not consistent with what we saw during Q1 to Q3 of last year, but significantly higher than 3.1%, we saw at the end of Q4. Just to be absolutely clear on this, are you guiding for a deterioration in the networking capital or none? It sounds like it a potential question, it does have quite a significant invocation for cash flow.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Markus Blanka (Executives)】\nRobert, this is Markus. Listen, certainly, a year end position for working capital is always be different during the year. And there is clearly, that's why we didn't corridor of between 3.5% and 4% which we achieve every single month to stay within that corridor. There's also seasonality to that, as you could imagine and some of your working capital naturally driven by rate. So when rates go up, there's going to be a higher working capital needs, and when we are going on low rates. So combined that altogether, second and third -- sorry, third and fourth quarter, we'll actually give a higher level of working capital, until we reach the December, where like every other company of our size, will stop payment to be supplied [indiscernible] before year end. But it's going to be very [indiscernible] is that answer the question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Joynson (Analysts)】\nOkay. But just to be absolutely clear here, when we are forecasting the end of 2014, it sounds like what you're saying that we shouldn't be assuming a deterioration beyond the 3.1%, we have seen at the end of Q4, 2013. Is that fair?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Markus Blanka (Executives)】\nI think, I'm not going to make a statement here 3.1% or 3.3%, but it's going to be in that range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Joynson (Analysts)】\nOkay. Just one final question on the that the tax range Q4, it was very low at about 17.5%. Can you just provide a comment on why that was, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gerard Van Kesteren (Executives)】\nWe were growing during the first 9 months, 72% and we did -- we reconciliation, we doing on monthly basis anyway but the [indiscernible] negative surprised us and the 21% for the full year 2013 is sustainable also for next year. The rate is the corridor but not on the same 21, 22 [ph] but for the full year 2013, with 71% we have sufficient provisions to hack our full year profit.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gerard Van Kesteren (Executives)】\nThank you very much. And we close the conference. See you again, or hear you again for the Q1 call. Bye-bye.",

But I guess the question I wanted to ask is should we be thinking about higher CSU [ph] selects x the TSS acquisition margins? Or is it still call it, let's say, in the 20% to 21% annual EBITA margin range?\n\n---\n\nSo it's a bit of a surprise for me too, Scott. The first thing I did was dive into the inter-quarter accrual one-time event type stuff. And I think we called that out fairly specifically. Jamal did a nice job of explaining it in the MD&A. So outside of that, I think there was still an increase in EBITA margin compared to what we have seen over the last little while. Perhaps not back a few years ago. And the problem, as always with our business, is that it really is the 100 and something business units, and so there's no -- nothing generic happening out there that leads me to believe that we're going to see a significant increase in margins over an extended period of time. So I think it's a blip. A couple of quarters into it, I'll tell -- I'll be able to tell better.\n\n---\n\nOkay. In the TSS letter to shareholders, you mentioned that some of the businesses at TSS either have a reduced or really no vertical market component at all. Is -- some of those businesses are selected divestitures, something we could see from the TSS business?\n\n---\n\nIt's not something we like to do. We pride ourselves in buying and holding forever businesses and believe that, that affects how we act towards them. And so a strong, strong preference is to hold things. Now there are some businesses that were sold in the past, for instance, our hardware distribution business that related to school, where it clearly was not core competency and something we focused on, and we ended up selling it. So I wouldn't say it's out of the question, but it's certainly not a first priority. The first priority is talking to the TSS people about our best practices, how we do stuff and trying to get them to think about the businesses that we do -- the way we do.\n\n---\n\nOne last one for me, and that is on the R&D initiatives at TSS. Organic growth looks fairly low for an extended period of time in that business. Do they manage and treat track initiatives similar to you? And is there an opportunity in your mind to take that investment higher?\n\n---\n\nSo there are multiple business units inside of TSS. They have different approaches to initiatives. One, which is kind of interesting and unique is a group where they, in essence, have almost an incubator for initiatives. And so I'm intrigued to study that and understand how they do it. We've tried that here as well and we sort of have a hybrid of that approach inside of one of our operating groups. So all kinds of models and approaches to doing initiatives are being tried already inside of Constellation, and welcome the opportunity to figure out what they're doing inside of TSS. It will probably be the area that we have the least influence on in the short term because it's a long-term investment in many of these investments they've already launched into, and they have views on how they're going to evolve. But it warrants tracking from the get-go, and so I'm trying to get them to break out initiatives and start tracking them and start forecasting how they will do with the initiatives, but I don't anticipate that there'll be any change in how they do, what they do on the initiative front for a while.\n\n---\n\nMark, with TSS being one of your international acquisitions, that kind of signal's at -- that's really where a lot of the opportunities are going to come from over the next few years here?\n\n---\n\nI still see very, very significant growth in our prospects in the international area. We add a lot more leads there than we add in North America on a percentage basis. Nonetheless, we still add a ton of leads from the North American markets. So I think it's going to be a balance, Richard. It really comes down to attractive opportunities and where they pop up.\n\n---\n\nRight. And I don't know if we can comment on this, but by region, there are certain areas that you see more opportunities than others in Europe and abroad? Or is it pretty much equal all over the place?\n\n---\n\nI think the point I've made previously is that software tends to be a substitute for labor. And, hence, high labor cost areas tend to have more attractive software prospects for us to acquire. Hence, we have not gone into developing nations as a target, an aggressive target. And we are doing a few things in developing nations, but very small.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And there is one final one for me. If you look at the cost in the professional service side, it seems to be up kind of a little bit more than some of your other areas of spending. Is that sort of a temporary lift or you need to sort of build that services organization a bit more to support some of these new acquisitions?\n\n---\n\nI'm looking vacantly at Jamal right now.\n\n---\n\nMy sense is in some of the groups, like North American transit, they have been adding professional services staff, but I don't get that sense generally across the board. It's something to watch because as I've mentioned before, I think professional services expenses are a bellwether for what happens in the business. I don't tend to look at it in an aggregate, but if it keeps trending upwards, it probably means that the managers see within each of their businesses the opportunity to deploy professional services people, which means that they're probably installing systems, which means the maintenance is probably likely to go up. So I think it tends to be tied to economic circumstances more closely than a lot of other functions inside the software businesses. It's not something you often hear people talk about, but I think it's one of the better bellwethers.\n\n---\n\nMark, now that you've owned TSS for a couple of months, can you talk about the opportunity for margin expansion in that business as you start talking to the managers and sharing the best practices with them?\n\n---\n\nWell, whenever you have intelligent managers they, of course, believe that they're doing a great job. And when you come in and say there are some best practices that you might consider, they -- because they're smart people, can explain to you the hundreds of reasons why those best practices won't work. So we're sort of going through that phase right now. We're trying to expose them as much as we can to the people and the practices at Constellation. I'm very hopeful that over time, some of those will transfer to TSS. And so, my expectation and hope is that we can help them run those businesses better, and presumably, some of that will show up on the bottom line.\n\n---\n\nOkay. In the MD&A, you comment that you're looking at selling a minority stake in TSS. And since that's not something that you typically do, could you provide some color on your thinking there?\n\n---\n\nIt was part and parcel of the transaction. We have not historically had minority shareholders in subsidiaries. The managers and shareholders of TSS wanted that ability to reinvest, and so that was negotiated as part of the transaction.\n\n---\n\nOkay, and finally, how should we think about management's available bandwidth and then your term with respect to completing more M&A. So does TSS slow you down in any way, shape or form, while you're digesting this acquisition? Or on the contrary, could TSS actually sustain or accelerate your pace of M&A given that you now have more of a team in Europe that can help you identify more targets?\n\n---\n\nWell, there's certainly one school of thought that having me spending time with TSS, keeps me out of the hair of the general managers of the other operating groups, and hence, the business will do better. And I don't anticipate personally being involved in any large transaction for the next year or so. So it'll be business as usual at head office, with the exception that I'll be spending time with TSS. And down the operating groups, I don't think they're really affected other than I am trying to get them involved in sharing best practices. So I don't see any real bandwidth issue, Thanos, in terms of TSS. Obviously, banging through 30 little acquisitions a year is nontrivial, and the operating groups have been doing it for a few years. It should be lovely to see that ramp to 50 a year and that will be the challenge providing that integration capability. The ability to bring those companies into the fold and bring them up to speed is a challenge that a lot of the operating group general managers have to deal with.\n\n---\n\nBut is it fair to assume that since -- with TSS, you're buying a team that had done M&A previously? Might that help you, over a long term, scale up your M&A deployments?\n\n---\n\nAs you may have noticed and I don't recall specifically, they've already completed one acquisition since June that's became part of Constellation. And I anticipate that they will very quickly fall into the same sort of cadence of acquisitions that our other operating groups have.\n\n---\n\nJust a bit of a follow-up to Thanos' question. In terms of the pipeline for larger acquisitions, are you seeing more larger deals after doing a couple of big ones this year? And what does the pipeline look like?\n\n---\n\nTwo questions in there. What does the pipeline look like and what is the large company pipeline look like. Large acquisitions tend to be in the pipeline for relatively short periods of time, from NDA through to close. They tend to be broker transactions that got a life of, let's call it, a couple of months, and you run to a clock that is set by the brokers and the vendors. Hence, we don't see those a long time before they happen, and when they do, we tend to go very quickly because that's how they drive you through that process. And I guess what I'm trying to say is, there's very little visibility on the large transactions, and when they're going to happen and when they're going to enter the funnel and how quickly they'll level the funnel. Back to the smaller transactions, the ones where we, call it, the owners stay in touch with them as opportunities arise, talk to them about how it might work, and then hopefully, having built a relationship, sort of gradually move towards an acquisition. We see those a lot further out. And right now, the funnel is not particularly robust. It's back sort of mid-last year kind of levels and I have no real sense of what that means because as we've said before, the predictive power of our M&A funnel is very, very poor. Obviously, Q4 was a big surprise compared to what we expected, both on the large transaction front and on the small transaction front.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And in terms of organic growth in both the public and private businesses, can you talk about the outlook going into 2014? Organic growth has been pretty strong in the last couple of quarters.\n\n---\n\nYes. The operating group general managers tend to be optimistic. They nearly always slip a few points of organic growth during the course of the year from what they forecast at the beginning. Right now, I'd say they're modestly optimistic. But given that history of slippage, you have to look at that with a somewhat jaundiced eye. Now there are some outliers where they actually hit their organic growth forecast and I went back and did an analysis of this about a year ago. So my ability to forecast based on their forecast is limited. But I'd say, if you wandered around the groups right now, there's a slight feeling of optimism about the economy compared to the last 2 or 3 years.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just one for Jamal. On the -- can you talk about the adjustments between in the TSS income statement in the bar and your Q4 report? It looks that the TSS margins in the bar were a bit higher than in your Q4 report. Is that just translation -- currency translation?\n\n---\n\nIt shouldn't be. So are you saying that the margins in the bar are different than in our MD&A?\n\n---\n\nIn terms of the TSS acquisitions, it looked a bit higher in the bar.\n\n---\n\nIt could be that one is EBITDA. Are you doing EBITDA to EBITA?\n\n---\n\nMaybe that's it. Okay. Yes, I'll go back and look at that.\n\n---\n\nThen the other issue is capitalization of software, as well, maybe?\n\n---\n\nNo, but everything else should tie. Like -- they come -- like it's the same number is going in both, it's just must be a matter of what we put in the bar tied to our financials versus the MD&A as it has EBITA in them.\n\n---\n\nYes, you're right. That's probably is what it is.\n\n---\n\nMark, maybe we can talk a little bit about the TSS, the statement that you're investigating or looking to adopt some of the financing techniques of, maybe some of the private equity peers to compete a little more effectively for deals of certain sizes. What do you entail that sort of envisioning down the road as we go here in terms of leverage, comfort levels?\n\n---\n\nThat really comes down to management, the TSS and what they want to do. I've seen private equity firms leverage firms to the hilt, drive for cash flow, pay down the debt, do recaps, and basically run their business around a financial model rather than operating model. I've seen other private equity firms use something they call a leverage build up, where they use leverage but they also acquire and they build their financing facilities, so they can continue to acquire. And you don't get as much financial leverage there, but you get some, hopefully, strategic and operating leverage. So it'll be an evolving thing, Paul. This is a team that is very sophisticated and capable of doing either of those approaches. I obviously much rather see them build the business as opposed to melt the business. And I'm pretty sure that's where we'll end up going.\n\n---\n\nIs there the potential to go back and refinance and implement this strategy across some of the other groups in the business?\n\n---\n\nIt's for sure would be a way of financing Constellation if other sources of capital were not easily available. Right now, I feel that other sources of capital are available and that we don't need to do that.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. I guess the second one is more on management structure. You talked a little bit, I think, first off to Scott, maybe in one of his questions, just about the cost and the margin. But as you steam towards 7,000 staff across the overall group, what about the need for additional structure? Or you feel like it's pretty much just organically getting built in, we're sort of assuming that in the cost base as we go?\n\n---\n\nWell, hopefully, it's already there because we're over 8,000 right now. So -- but your underlying question is a legitimate one, and that's how do you manage something with hundreds of business units. And we're obviously studying people who've done before to see how they've done it.\n\n---\n\nFair enough.\n\n---\n\nAll of our businesses are dealing with the issue right now. And what tends to happen is, like many of the things inside of Constellation, we bubble up people who have both the ambition and the talent inside the organization to roles that are increasingly large. So someone who ran a function often ends up running a business unit; someone who run a business unit, ends up running a group of businesses; and someone who runs a group of business units, end up running an operating group. And that's worked well for us over the years, and I feel really comfortable with the quality of people that we have in the organization and their cultural alignment with the organization. And it means that we can run the place with relatively low overheads compared to command and control type organization.\n\n---\n\nOkay, and last one for me, just maybe revisiting what we talked about, I guess, March 7 of last year around some of the European margins and the impact. And we spent some time on that call talking about, we weren't sure how long it was going to take to bring them on plan. It seems like you made great progress there -- would appear, there's good progress there. What's played out, I guess, over the last, almost now it's a year?\n\n---\n\nSo there's definitely been progress, but it's been uneven. Some of our European operations are doing far, far better than others, and we're learning a lot about operating in Europe. I wouldn't call us masterful yet, in terms of our ability to manage European critical market softer businesses and be great owners of such businesses, but I think we're learning.\n\n---\n\nMark, just going back to some of the previous questions. Could you maybe talk a little bit more about some of the best practices that you could adopt as a company, based on the TSS acquisition for further larger deals down the road?\n\n---\n\nThat's a big question. So the most obvious thing is benchmarking. You compare business units to each other, and you look at how they differ and you try and understand whether there's legitimate differences or merely differences in execution. If it's execution, then you work on execution.\n\n---\n\nOkay.\n\n---\n\nIt's compensation. It's a host of different things. It's kind of like trying to describe a building as a whole as opposed to the individual bricks that go into it. If you pick a brick, I can talk about it. But there's an awful lot of bricks in the building.\n\n---\n\nRight. Okay. So fair enough to say that, I mean, based on the TSS acquisition and the fact that there's enough bandwidth, you would not be sort of constrained in any sort of way for further larger deals, just from a management capacity and bandwidth point of view, right?\n\n---\n\nNo. I think I said the opposite of that. I personally will not be able to go work on a large transaction for the foreseeable future. I think each of our operating group managers has that capacity. But within their realm, there may only be a low handful of large potential transactions that they'd want to go chase, nearly always somewhat strategic. So there aren't going to be a lot of those bubbling along. And -- but if something in North America came along in one of our key verticals, that was large, I think we'd do it. We'd find a way.\n\n---\n\nRight, right. Okay, fair enough. And just a couple of quick housekeeping questions. Does TSS have any sort of expense seasonality, which is similar to what Constellation might have?\n\n---\n\nI'm not close enough to their tax issues to understand whether they run into that Q1 tax and HR contribution issue that we run into in North America.\n\n---\n\nOkay, and just one last one. Then overall, how should we think about the tax rate going forward? Maybe not on a quarterly basis, but just sort of rough ballpark.\n\n---\n\nWell, I think long term, I would think about tax rates going up. It appears that governments everywhere are keen to shut down whatever tax structures that are available and move everyone towards marginal rate. So as we've said, year-after-year, if we were to stop acquiring, our tax rate would go up dramatically. We're in the fortunate position that right now in both the U.S., Canada, when you acquire, particularly if you acquire assets, you can write them off relatively quickly for tax purposes, and that shields our short-term tax rate.\n\n---\n\nMark, I wonder if you can just touch on maintenance renewal levels in the sort of December, January timeframe and the pricing environment, and also how does that -- how do renewals look at the TSS business?\n\n---\n\nWe have so many clients that it would be very, very hard to do that on a monthly kind of basis. What we do is once a year send out a request to the operating groups and generate the stats for the year. And we usually publish that around May, early May, and you'll be able to sort of delve into that in some detail. There's pricing, there's attrition, there's new adds and there's acquired maintenance, broken out separately, and hopefully, adding up to our overall net maintenance revenue.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then, in terms of Software as a Service, you've talked in the past about, maybe starting to disclose your business, your Software as a Service offerings. So what's your thinking at this point on that?\n\n---\n\nSo we had a discussion in the board yesterday. We have the information. We are recently comfortable that we've got a crisp enough that we could share it. I'm a little uncomfortable that the cost of goods sold associated with a lot of the SaaS, and hosting and transaction-based models are not clear yet to us. And, hence, if we tell you that SaaS revenues are x percentage of overall maintenance revenues and we can't answer the subsequent question of whether that's a good or a bad thing, I'm not comfortable. And so we're going to get some more information before we start sharing that information.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Great. And Jamal, just one for you. In the business -- in the bar report, it notes the service revenue of EUR 166 million last year for TSS. What was -- how much of that was maintenance revenues versus what you would consider consulting services or IT Services?\n\n---\n\nSo in the MD&A we break out the different revenue streams for TSS, is that the number you're actually referring?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think that's what I'd like.\n\n---\n\nSo I think Blair there's more detail in the MD&A.\n\n---\n\nYes. Like in the MD&A, we break out license, PS [ph], hardware and maintenance occurring, right?\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. I just saw the minor breakouts.\n\n---\n\nWhat's the page?\n\n---\n\nIt's Page 12 of the MD&A.\n\n---\n\nMark, I just like to pick your brain for a moment on sort of the longer term strategy and the move to financially levered deals. And so, I think in your letter last year, you mentioned that it will be a fundamental change to move to those type of structure. And in particular, considering the use of stand-alone debt financing and that the return is below your hurdle rate if you don't use the leverage. My question is, what do you see is the opportunity? Or why go this route considering the hassle of having to put in place the financing structure versus your model in the past, which has been, acquire a lot of small businesses?\n\n---\n\nWe're going to keep acquiring a lot of small businesses. I wouldn't see us touching this largely rich transaction market until we felt we had exhausted the small business acquisition market. So it's a -- I would say, much less attractive business model than our core business model.\n\n---\n\nAnd so there's no -- the core is still in place, which is 20 to 30, perhaps 50, smaller deals per year?\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely. And I would not do anything to put that at risk or to divert capital from that.\n\n---\n\nSo is it -- is this more of a, just putting your toe in the water? And it's almost an experiment at this point, before delving into it at some point when the smaller market is exhausted?\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then thinking also about these financially leveraged deals, it's probably safe to assume that you're paying closer to market rates for the assets in the smaller ones. So is there inherently more value-creation opportunity based on time in the market and making opportunistic acquisitions during market duress? So like in 2007, 2008?\n\n---\n\nSo I think, 2 different issues there. One is I think we pay market for both. And so in the small transaction market, they tend to trade at lower multiples then very large businesses that have been optimized. In the large transaction market, usually, you've had fairly sophisticated though perhaps, short-term oriented shareholders owning these businesses. They may or may not have had software expertise to bring it to table. If it was a strategic acquire and they decide that software is hard or not as good a fit as they thought, those distressed assets can be very attractive to us. If it's an economic recession, it may not be that the softer assets are suffering, it could be that the parent business is suffering and they're looking for ways to free up capital. What we discovered during recession, John Billowits and I at that time, John was the CFO, went around and visited all private equity groups because we thought we were going to have a heyday buying up troubled software businesses. But what we discovered was they all came through the recession in pretty good shape. So despite the fact that they were leveraged to the gills, they managed to do fairly well. So I don't think you see a lot of distress because of financial leverage type opportunities, even during recessions. I think it's more of the sort of strategic disposition market. You don't need, if you're getting them at attractive prices, to leverage them up. And I think there's real benefit to not having management worry about both financial risk and operating risk. If they're focusing on building a great business as opposed to meeting bank covenants, I think they're going to do a better job of building that business. And so financial leverage to me is a last resort as opposed to a first resort inside of our operating groups. But the parent company, it may be a different issue as I've studied the high performance conglomerates over the years. What I've seen is that nearly all of them have used increasing amounts of leverage over time, particularly, if they are fairly diversified. I think we'd certainly qualify for that category. The trick, of course, is to end up with the right kind of capital in the business. Capital that you feel good about, that is long-term oriented and that you can live with. And that's the challenge that I've got right now, is trying to figure out what the best sources of capital for Constellation are long term. Did I answer the least part of your question, Paul?\n\n---\n\nYes. And I think that the follow on to that is, I think the comment about the dividend and your flexibility around the dividend. And is that more about using it as a source of capital if there are the right opportunities available?\n\n---\n\nYes. The dividend has got me torn. Finance theory says if you need the cash and you're paying a dividend and there's no transaction cost, it's a legitimate place to go and raise capital, so to speak. At the same time, we feel this obligation to the people that came in to help us transition out our private equity shares -- shareholders, 2 or 3 years ago, or over that period of time to maintain the dividend because that's one of the things that attracted them. And so we're torn between sort of 2 poles. However, what I wanted to do is signal to shareholders that the dividend is always up for consideration by the board. If we were to stumble across an attractive acquisition for one of our -- in one of our key verticals and needed the capital, we would sacrifice the dividend, absolutely.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just lastly on TSS specifically. It seems like in the past, just looking at the past annual reports, they had a slightly different strategy than the way you've run your business. I think they used a little bit more integration of the units in more sort of like a branding strategy across the units. From a philosophical point of view, I mean, do you think that you see that model changing towards the way you run the business more? Or is that -- are they dead set on that strategy on the way they run that business? Or is it sort of a blending of the 2?\n\n---\n\nWell, we are quite different in our approaches to branding and things of that ilk. What I find wonderful is they're intelligent, open to rational argument and I suspect will end up somewhere in between, although I'm not about to end up with a pink and blue logo.\n\n---\n\nI mean, just looking at your pipeline going into 2014 versus last year, are you seeing better quality targets that need less restructuring? As you sort of take a first look at these companies? Or the quality sort of remains the same year-over-year?\n\n---\n\nSo this is one of the debates that comes up with the board all the time, which is, should we buy quality companies or companies that are great value? And I think we have the capacity to do either, but they tend to fall into natural categories. So the businesses that people have built over 20 or 30 years that are independently owned by founders, tend to be high quality businesses. They love their clients, their products and their people. And they pour, usually the proceeds of the business, back into building those things. Hence, they are inherently high quality businesses. A business that has been a subsidiary of larger business and has been sold, has been mismanaged, let's say, and is being sold distressed, often has lost some of its franchise, some of its key employees, some of its products have gotten longer in the tooth and will be more of a long-term challenge. So those are the 2 sort of broadish categories you tend to run into.\n\n---\n\nAnd what are you seeing more this year versus last year? Or is it the same? Or...\n\n---\n\nI would say, mostly we're seeing the mom-and-pop businesses that are 25 to 50 people, maybe 100 people, that have been built up over the years. They tend to be nice businesses.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Excellent. And then on the vertical side, where are you seeing the highest opportunities for growth; healthcare, automotive, logistics as you sort of look at the private sector opportunities?\n\n---\n\nYes. We tend to be kind of cyclical, so we're usually looking for the things that are suffering right now. And so there aren't very many, unfortunately, sectors that are suffering. But if there is one, we're probably looking.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to follow-up on Paul's line of questioning, and I dearly hope you didn't answer this, I might have missed some of the answer, Mark. But rather than keying on size and the considerations, really a decide [ph] on the need or desire for debt, I wonder if we could just focus on the idea of complexion of a deal and whether maintenance and events, as having been such a great model with the encouragement of more SaaS, may change the complexion of the acquisitions and therefore, the cash flow dynamics, such that debt may be more of a requirement. Is that a consideration?\n\n---\n\nIt certainly would affect the economics of whatever business we buy. But there are some heartening trends out there in the industry. So the original promise of SaaS was pay as you go, and a lot of the models were monthly pay. What we're seeing is that sales force has started to change the way they're charging. I saw a stat and I can't remember where, but I think it's between 80% and 90% of their revenues are now, annually in advance. So the economic model of SaaS, I think, is recognized that it's way better to collect the dough in advance. And with the leader in the SaaS world going there, I think others will follow. And so I'm hopeful that, that will become a norm in the industry and it won't be any different from a normal conventional maintenance model from an economic perspective.\n\n---\n\nJust, Jamal, I wanted to kind of pin you down a bit on the tax rate, at least on the income statement. I think in the past, you've said 10% to 15%, and it will probably creep towards the high end of that range. What -- I mean, is that commentary still hold with the combined company in the next year?\n\n---\n\nYes, definitely. I mean, the tax rate at TSS average is probably higher than what's CSI's was, so it -- that wouldn't bring it down by anyway -- it's not -- material enough to bring it outside of that range.\n\n---\n\nOkay, and lastly, the -- any worthwhile commentary on what would give rise to the bargain purchase gain in the quarter? Is that more of an accounting construct than anything else?\n\n---\n\nYes. Again, it's just an acquisition we found, where the assets weren't of value to the seller, better of value to us.\n\n---\n\nThank you for joining the Q4 call. And we are always happy to meet with shareholders. So if you'd like to meet in person, just give us a call and we'll make the time to see you at our office. Goodbye now, and we'll talk to you on the Q1 call. Thank you, Melanie.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Scott Penner (Analysts)】\nJust maybe, first of all, Mark, the Q4 EBITA margin was I think a fairly big surprise. I noticed a couple of inter-quarter accrual movements. But I guess the question I wanted to ask is should we be thinking about higher CSU [ph] selects x the TSS acquisition margins? Or is it still call it, let's say, in the 20% to 21% annual EBITA margin range?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nSo it's a bit of a surprise for me too, Scott. The first thing I did was dive into the inter-quarter accrual one-time event type stuff. And I think we called that out fairly specifically. Jamal did a nice job of explaining it in the MD&A. So outside of that, I think there was still an increase in EBITA margin compared to what we have seen over the last little while. Perhaps not back a few years ago. And the problem, as always with our business, is that it really is the 100 and something business units, and so there's no -- nothing generic happening out there that leads me to believe that we're going to see a significant increase in margins over an extended period of time. So I think it's a blip. A couple of quarters into it, I'll tell -- I'll be able to tell better.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Penner (Analysts)】\nOkay. In the TSS letter to shareholders, you mentioned that some of the businesses at TSS either have a reduced or really no vertical market component at all. Is -- some of those businesses are selected divestitures, something we could see from the TSS business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nIt's not something we like to do. We pride ourselves in buying and holding forever businesses and believe that, that affects how we act towards them. And so a strong, strong preference is to hold things. Now there are some businesses that were sold in the past, for instance, our hardware distribution business that related to school, where it clearly was not core competency and something we focused on, and we ended up selling it. So I wouldn't say it's out of the question, but it's certainly not a first priority. The first priority is talking to the TSS people about our best practices, how we do stuff and trying to get them to think about the businesses that we do -- the way we do.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Penner (Analysts)】\nOne last one for me, and that is on the R&D initiatives at TSS. Organic growth looks fairly low for an extended period of time in that business. Do they manage and treat track initiatives similar to you? And is there an opportunity in your mind to take that investment higher?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nSo there are multiple business units inside of TSS. They have different approaches to initiatives. One, which is kind of interesting and unique is a group where they, in essence, have almost an incubator for initiatives. And so I'm intrigued to study that and understand how they do it. We've tried that here as well and we sort of have a hybrid of that approach inside of one of our operating groups. So all kinds of models and approaches to doing initiatives are being tried already inside of Constellation, and welcome the opportunity to figure out what they're doing inside of TSS. It will probably be the area that we have the least influence on in the short term because it's a long-term investment in many of these investments they've already launched into, and they have views on how they're going to evolve. But it warrants tracking from the get-go, and so I'm trying to get them to break out initiatives and start tracking them and start forecasting how they will do with the initiatives, but I don't anticipate that there'll be any change in how they do, what they do on the initiative front for a while.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Tse (Analysts)】\nMark, with TSS being one of your international acquisitions, that kind of signal's at -- that's really where a lot of the opportunities are going to come from over the next few years here?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nI still see very, very significant growth in our prospects in the international area. We add a lot more leads there than we add in North America on a percentage basis. Nonetheless, we still add a ton of leads from the North American markets. So I think it's going to be a balance, Richard. It really comes down to attractive opportunities and where they pop up.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Tse (Analysts)】\nRight. And I don't know if we can comment on this, but by region, there are certain areas that you see more opportunities than others in Europe and abroad? Or is it pretty much equal all over the place?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nI think the point I've made previously is that software tends to be a substitute for labor. And, hence, high labor cost areas tend to have more attractive software prospects for us to acquire. Hence, we have not gone into developing nations as a target, an aggressive target. And we are doing a few things in developing nations, but very small.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Tse (Analysts)】\nOkay. And there is one final one for me. If you look at the cost in the professional service side, it seems to be up kind of a little bit more than some of your other areas of spending. Is that sort of a temporary lift or you need to sort of build that services organization a bit more to support some of these new acquisitions?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nI'm looking vacantly at Jamal right now.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jamal Baksh (Executives)】\nMy sense is in some of the groups, like North American transit, they have been adding professional services staff, but I don't get that sense generally across the board. It's something to watch because as I've mentioned before, I think professional services expenses are a bellwether for what happens in the business. I don't tend to look at it in an aggregate, but if it keeps trending upwards, it probably means that the managers see within each of their businesses the opportunity to deploy professional services people, which means that they're probably installing systems, which means the maintenance is probably likely to go up. So I think it tends to be tied to economic circumstances more closely than a lot of other functions inside the software businesses. It's not something you often hear people talk about, but I think it's one of the better bellwethers.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thanos Moschopoulos (Analysts)】\nMark, now that you've owned TSS for a couple of months, can you talk about the opportunity for margin expansion in that business as you start talking to the managers and sharing the best practices with them?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nWell, whenever you have intelligent managers they, of course, believe that they're doing a great job. And when you come in and say there are some best practices that you might consider, they -- because they're smart people, can explain to you the hundreds of reasons why those best practices won't work. So we're sort of going through that phase right now. We're trying to expose them as much as we can to the people and the practices at Constellation. I'm very hopeful that over time, some of those will transfer to TSS. And so, my expectation and hope is that we can help them run those businesses better, and presumably, some of that will show up on the bottom line.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thanos Moschopoulos (Analysts)】\nOkay. In the MD&A, you comment that you're looking at selling a minority stake in TSS. And since that's not something that you typically do, could you provide some color on your thinking there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nIt was part and parcel of the transaction. We have not historically had minority shareholders in subsidiaries. The managers and shareholders of TSS wanted that ability to reinvest, and so that was negotiated as part of the transaction.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thanos Moschopoulos (Analysts)】\nOkay, and finally, how should we think about management's available bandwidth and then your term with respect to completing more M&A. So does TSS slow you down in any way, shape or form, while you're digesting this acquisition? Or on the contrary, could TSS actually sustain or accelerate your pace of M&A given that you now have more of a team in Europe that can help you identify more targets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nWell, there's certainly one school of thought that having me spending time with TSS, keeps me out of the hair of the general managers of the other operating groups, and hence, the business will do better. And I don't anticipate personally being involved in any large transaction for the next year or so. So it'll be business as usual at head office, with the exception that I'll be spending time with TSS. And down the operating groups, I don't think they're really affected other than I am trying to get them involved in sharing best practices. So I don't see any real bandwidth issue, Thanos, in terms of TSS. Obviously, banging through 30 little acquisitions a year is nontrivial, and the operating groups have been doing it for a few years. It should be lovely to see that ramp to 50 a year and that will be the challenge providing that integration capability. The ability to bring those companies into the fold and bring them up to speed is a challenge that a lot of the operating group general managers have to deal with.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thanos Moschopoulos (Analysts)】\nBut is it fair to assume that since -- with TSS, you're buying a team that had done M&A previously? Might that help you, over a long term, scale up your M&A deployments?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nAs you may have noticed and I don't recall specifically, they've already completed one acquisition since June that's became part of Constellation. And I anticipate that they will very quickly fall into the same sort of cadence of acquisitions that our other operating groups have.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephanie Price (Analysts)】\nJust a bit of a follow-up to Thanos' question. In terms of the pipeline for larger acquisitions, are you seeing more larger deals after doing a couple of big ones this year? And what does the pipeline look like?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nTwo questions in there. What does the pipeline look like and what is the large company pipeline look like. Large acquisitions tend to be in the pipeline for relatively short periods of time, from NDA through to close. They tend to be broker transactions that got a life of, let's call it, a couple of months, and you run to a clock that is set by the brokers and the vendors. Hence, we don't see those a long time before they happen, and when they do, we tend to go very quickly because that's how they drive you through that process. And I guess what I'm trying to say is, there's very little visibility on the large transactions, and when they're going to happen and when they're going to enter the funnel and how quickly they'll level the funnel. Back to the smaller transactions, the ones where we, call it, the owners stay in touch with them as opportunities arise, talk to them about how it might work, and then hopefully, having built a relationship, sort of gradually move towards an acquisition. We see those a lot further out. And right now, the funnel is not particularly robust. It's back sort of mid-last year kind of levels and I have no real sense of what that means because as we've said before, the predictive power of our M&A funnel is very, very poor. Obviously, Q4 was a big surprise compared to what we expected, both on the large transaction front and on the small transaction front.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephanie Price (Analysts)】\nOkay. And in terms of organic growth in both the public and private businesses, can you talk about the outlook going into 2014? Organic growth has been pretty strong in the last couple of quarters.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nYes. The operating group general managers tend to be optimistic. They nearly always slip a few points of organic growth during the course of the year from what they forecast at the beginning. Right now, I'd say they're modestly optimistic. But given that history of slippage, you have to look at that with a somewhat jaundiced eye. Now there are some outliers where they actually hit their organic growth forecast and I went back and did an analysis of this about a year ago. So my ability to forecast based on their forecast is limited. But I'd say, if you wandered around the groups right now, there's a slight feeling of optimism about the economy compared to the last 2 or 3 years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephanie Price (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just one for Jamal. On the -- can you talk about the adjustments between in the TSS income statement in the bar and your Q4 report? It looks that the TSS margins in the bar were a bit higher than in your Q4 report. Is that just translation -- currency translation?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jamal Baksh (Executives)】\nIt shouldn't be. So are you saying that the margins in the bar are different than in our MD&A?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephanie Price (Analysts)】\nIn terms of the TSS acquisitions, it looked a bit higher in the bar.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jamal Baksh (Executives)】\nIt could be that one is EBITDA. Are you doing EBITDA to EBITA?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephanie Price (Analysts)】\nMaybe that's it. Okay. Yes, I'll go back and look at that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nThen the other issue is capitalization of software, as well, maybe?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jamal Baksh (Executives)】\nNo, but everything else should tie. Like -- they come -- like it's the same number is going in both, it's just must be a matter of what we put in the bar tied to our financials versus the MD&A as it has EBITA in them.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephanie Price (Analysts)】\nYes, you're right. That's probably is what it is.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Steep (Analysts)】\nMark, maybe we can talk a little bit about the TSS, the statement that you're investigating or looking to adopt some of the financing techniques of, maybe some of the private equity peers to compete a little more effectively for deals of certain sizes. What do you entail that sort of envisioning down the road as we go here in terms of leverage, comfort levels?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nThat really comes down to management, the TSS and what they want to do. I've seen private equity firms leverage firms to the hilt, drive for cash flow, pay down the debt, do recaps, and basically run their business around a financial model rather than operating model. I've seen other private equity firms use something they call a leverage build up, where they use leverage but they also acquire and they build their financing facilities, so they can continue to acquire. And you don't get as much financial leverage there, but you get some, hopefully, strategic and operating leverage. So it'll be an evolving thing, Paul. This is a team that is very sophisticated and capable of doing either of those approaches. I obviously much rather see them build the business as opposed to melt the business. And I'm pretty sure that's where we'll end up going.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Steep (Analysts)】\nIs there the potential to go back and refinance and implement this strategy across some of the other groups in the business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nIt's for sure would be a way of financing Constellation if other sources of capital were not easily available. Right now, I feel that other sources of capital are available and that we don't need to do that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Steep (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. I guess the second one is more on management structure. You talked a little bit, I think, first off to Scott, maybe in one of his questions, just about the cost and the margin. But as you steam towards 7,000 staff across the overall group, what about the need for additional structure? Or you feel like it's pretty much just organically getting built in, we're sort of assuming that in the cost base as we go?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nWell, hopefully, it's already there because we're over 8,000 right now. So -- but your underlying question is a legitimate one, and that's how do you manage something with hundreds of business units. And we're obviously studying people who've done before to see how they've done it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Steep (Analysts)】\nFair enough.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nAll of our businesses are dealing with the issue right now. And what tends to happen is, like many of the things inside of Constellation, we bubble up people who have both the ambition and the talent inside the organization to roles that are increasingly large. So someone who ran a function often ends up running a business unit; someone who run a business unit, ends up running a group of businesses; and someone who runs a group of business units, end up running an operating group. And that's worked well for us over the years, and I feel really comfortable with the quality of people that we have in the organization and their cultural alignment with the organization. And it means that we can run the place with relatively low overheads compared to command and control type organization.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Steep (Analysts)】\nOkay, and last one for me, just maybe revisiting what we talked about, I guess, March 7 of last year around some of the European margins and the impact. And we spent some time on that call talking about, we weren't sure how long it was going to take to bring them on plan. It seems like you made great progress there -- would appear, there's good progress there. What's played out, I guess, over the last, almost now it's a year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nSo there's definitely been progress, but it's been uneven. Some of our European operations are doing far, far better than others, and we're learning a lot about operating in Europe. I wouldn't call us masterful yet, in terms of our ability to manage European critical market softer businesses and be great owners of such businesses, but I think we're learning.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nikhil Thadani (Analysts)】\nMark, just going back to some of the previous questions. Could you maybe talk a little bit more about some of the best practices that you could adopt as a company, based on the TSS acquisition for further larger deals down the road?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nThat's a big question. So the most obvious thing is benchmarking. You compare business units to each other, and you look at how they differ and you try and understand whether there's legitimate differences or merely differences in execution. If it's execution, then you work on execution.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nikhil Thadani (Analysts)】\nOkay.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nIt's compensation. It's a host of different things. It's kind of like trying to describe a building as a whole as opposed to the individual bricks that go into it. If you pick a brick, I can talk about it. But there's an awful lot of bricks in the building.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nikhil Thadani (Analysts)】\nRight. Okay. So fair enough to say that, I mean, based on the TSS acquisition and the fact that there's enough bandwidth, you would not be sort of constrained in any sort of way for further larger deals, just from a management capacity and bandwidth point of view, right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nNo. I think I said the opposite of that. I personally will not be able to go work on a large transaction for the foreseeable future. I think each of our operating group managers has that capacity. But within their realm, there may only be a low handful of large potential transactions that they'd want to go chase, nearly always somewhat strategic. So there aren't going to be a lot of those bubbling along. And -- but if something in North America came along in one of our key verticals, that was large, I think we'd do it. We'd find a way.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nikhil Thadani (Analysts)】\nRight, right. Okay, fair enough. And just a couple of quick housekeeping questions. Does TSS have any sort of expense seasonality, which is similar to what Constellation might have?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nI'm not close enough to their tax issues to understand whether they run into that Q1 tax and HR contribution issue that we run into in North America.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nikhil Thadani (Analysts)】\nOkay, and just one last one. Then overall, how should we think about the tax rate going forward? Maybe not on a quarterly basis, but just sort of rough ballpark.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nWell, I think long term, I would think about tax rates going up. It appears that governments everywhere are keen to shut down whatever tax structures that are available and move everyone towards marginal rate. So as we've said, year-after-year, if we were to stop acquiring, our tax rate would go up dramatically. We're in the fortunate position that right now in both the U.S., Canada, when you acquire, particularly if you acquire assets, you can write them off relatively quickly for tax purposes, and that shields our short-term tax rate.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Blair Abernethy (Analysts)】\nMark, I wonder if you can just touch on maintenance renewal levels in the sort of December, January timeframe and the pricing environment, and also how does that -- how do renewals look at the TSS business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nWe have so many clients that it would be very, very hard to do that on a monthly kind of basis. What we do is once a year send out a request to the operating groups and generate the stats for the year. And we usually publish that around May, early May, and you'll be able to sort of delve into that in some detail. There's pricing, there's attrition, there's new adds and there's acquired maintenance, broken out separately, and hopefully, adding up to our overall net maintenance revenue.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Blair Abernethy (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then, in terms of Software as a Service, you've talked in the past about, maybe starting to disclose your business, your Software as a Service offerings. So what's your thinking at this point on that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nSo we had a discussion in the board yesterday. We have the information. We are recently comfortable that we've got a crisp enough that we could share it. I'm a little uncomfortable that the cost of goods sold associated with a lot of the SaaS, and hosting and transaction-based models are not clear yet to us. And, hence, if we tell you that SaaS revenues are x percentage of overall maintenance revenues and we can't answer the subsequent question of whether that's a good or a bad thing, I'm not comfortable. And so we're going to get some more information before we start sharing that information.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Blair Abernethy (Analysts)】\nOkay. Great. And Jamal, just one for you. In the business -- in the bar report, it notes the service revenue of EUR 166 million last year for TSS. What was -- how much of that was maintenance revenues versus what you would consider consulting services or IT Services?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jamal Baksh (Executives)】\nSo in the MD&A we break out the different revenue streams for TSS, is that the number you're actually referring?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Blair Abernethy (Analysts)】\nYes, I think that's what I'd like.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nSo I think Blair there's more detail in the MD&A.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jamal Baksh (Executives)】\nYes. Like in the MD&A, we break out license, PS [ph], hardware and maintenance occurring, right?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Blair Abernethy (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. I just saw the minor breakouts.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nWhat's the page?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jamal Baksh (Executives)】\nIt's Page 12 of the MD&A.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Treiber (Analysts)】\nMark, I just like to pick your brain for a moment on sort of the longer term strategy and the move to financially levered deals. And so, I think in your letter last year, you mentioned that it will be a fundamental change to move to those type of structure. And in particular, considering the use of stand-alone debt financing and that the return is below your hurdle rate if you don't use the leverage. My question is, what do you see is the opportunity? Or why go this route considering the hassle of having to put in place the financing structure versus your model in the past, which has been, acquire a lot of small businesses?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nWe're going to keep acquiring a lot of small businesses. I wouldn't see us touching this largely rich transaction market until we felt we had exhausted the small business acquisition market. So it's a -- I would say, much less attractive business model than our core business model.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Treiber (Analysts)】\nAnd so there's no -- the core is still in place, which is 20 to 30, perhaps 50, smaller deals per year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nAbsolutely. And I would not do anything to put that at risk or to divert capital from that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Treiber (Analysts)】\nSo is it -- is this more of a, just putting your toe in the water? And it's almost an experiment at this point, before delving into it at some point when the smaller market is exhausted?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nAbsolutely.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Treiber (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then thinking also about these financially leveraged deals, it's probably safe to assume that you're paying closer to market rates for the assets in the smaller ones. So is there inherently more value-creation opportunity based on time in the market and making opportunistic acquisitions during market duress? So like in 2007, 2008?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nSo I think, 2 different issues there. One is I think we pay market for both. And so in the small transaction market, they tend to trade at lower multiples then very large businesses that have been optimized. In the large transaction market, usually, you've had fairly sophisticated though perhaps, short-term oriented shareholders owning these businesses. They may or may not have had software expertise to bring it to table. If it was a strategic acquire and they decide that software is hard or not as good a fit as they thought, those distressed assets can be very attractive to us. If it's an economic recession, it may not be that the softer assets are suffering, it could be that the parent business is suffering and they're looking for ways to free up capital. What we discovered during recession, John Billowits and I at that time, John was the CFO, went around and visited all private equity groups because we thought we were going to have a heyday buying up troubled software businesses. But what we discovered was they all came through the recession in pretty good shape. So despite the fact that they were leveraged to the gills, they managed to do fairly well. So I don't think you see a lot of distress because of financial leverage type opportunities, even during recessions. I think it's more of the sort of strategic disposition market. You don't need, if you're getting them at attractive prices, to leverage them up. And I think there's real benefit to not having management worry about both financial risk and operating risk. If they're focusing on building a great business as opposed to meeting bank covenants, I think they're going to do a better job of building that business. And so financial leverage to me is a last resort as opposed to a first resort inside of our operating groups. But the parent company, it may be a different issue as I've studied the high performance conglomerates over the years. What I've seen is that nearly all of them have used increasing amounts of leverage over time, particularly, if they are fairly diversified. I think we'd certainly qualify for that category. The trick, of course, is to end up with the right kind of capital in the business. Capital that you feel good about, that is long-term oriented and that you can live with. And that's the challenge that I've got right now, is trying to figure out what the best sources of capital for Constellation are long term. Did I answer the least part of your question, Paul?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Treiber (Analysts)】\nYes. And I think that the follow on to that is, I think the comment about the dividend and your flexibility around the dividend. And is that more about using it as a source of capital if there are the right opportunities available?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nYes. The dividend has got me torn. Finance theory says if you need the cash and you're paying a dividend and there's no transaction cost, it's a legitimate place to go and raise capital, so to speak. At the same time, we feel this obligation to the people that came in to help us transition out our private equity shares -- shareholders, 2 or 3 years ago, or over that period of time to maintain the dividend because that's one of the things that attracted them. And so we're torn between sort of 2 poles. However, what I wanted to do is signal to shareholders that the dividend is always up for consideration by the board. If we were to stumble across an attractive acquisition for one of our -- in one of our key verticals and needed the capital, we would sacrifice the dividend, absolutely.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Treiber (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just lastly on TSS specifically. It seems like in the past, just looking at the past annual reports, they had a slightly different strategy than the way you've run your business. I think they used a little bit more integration of the units in more sort of like a branding strategy across the units. From a philosophical point of view, I mean, do you think that you see that model changing towards the way you run the business more? Or is that -- are they dead set on that strategy on the way they run that business? Or is it sort of a blending of the 2?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nWell, we are quite different in our approaches to branding and things of that ilk. What I find wonderful is they're intelligent, open to rational argument and I suspect will end up somewhere in between, although I'm not about to end up with a pink and blue logo.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ralph Garcea (Analysts)】\nI mean, just looking at your pipeline going into 2014 versus last year, are you seeing better quality targets that need less restructuring? As you sort of take a first look at these companies? Or the quality sort of remains the same year-over-year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nSo this is one of the debates that comes up with the board all the time, which is, should we buy quality companies or companies that are great value? And I think we have the capacity to do either, but they tend to fall into natural categories. So the businesses that people have built over 20 or 30 years that are independently owned by founders, tend to be high quality businesses. They love their clients, their products and their people. And they pour, usually the proceeds of the business, back into building those things. Hence, they are inherently high quality businesses. A business that has been a subsidiary of larger business and has been sold, has been mismanaged, let's say, and is being sold distressed, often has lost some of its franchise, some of its key employees, some of its products have gotten longer in the tooth and will be more of a long-term challenge. So those are the 2 sort of broadish categories you tend to run into.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ralph Garcea (Analysts)】\nAnd what are you seeing more this year versus last year? Or is it the same? Or...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nI would say, mostly we're seeing the mom-and-pop businesses that are 25 to 50 people, maybe 100 people, that have been built up over the years. They tend to be nice businesses.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ralph Garcea (Analysts)】\nOkay. Excellent. And then on the vertical side, where are you seeing the highest opportunities for growth; healthcare, automotive, logistics as you sort of look at the private sector opportunities?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nYes. We tend to be kind of cyclical, so we're usually looking for the things that are suffering right now. And so there aren't very many, unfortunately, sectors that are suffering. But if there is one, we're probably looking.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Keating (Analysts)】\nI wanted to follow-up on Paul's line of questioning, and I dearly hope you didn't answer this, I might have missed some of the answer, Mark. But rather than keying on size and the considerations, really a decide [ph] on the need or desire for debt, I wonder if we could just focus on the idea of complexion of a deal and whether maintenance and events, as having been such a great model with the encouragement of more SaaS, may change the complexion of the acquisitions and therefore, the cash flow dynamics, such that debt may be more of a requirement. Is that a consideration?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nIt certainly would affect the economics of whatever business we buy. But there are some heartening trends out there in the industry. So the original promise of SaaS was pay as you go, and a lot of the models were monthly pay. What we're seeing is that sales force has started to change the way they're charging. I saw a stat and I can't remember where, but I think it's between 80% and 90% of their revenues are now, annually in advance. So the economic model of SaaS, I think, is recognized that it's way better to collect the dough in advance. And with the leader in the SaaS world going there, I think others will follow. And so I'm hopeful that, that will become a norm in the industry and it won't be any different from a normal conventional maintenance model from an economic perspective.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Penner (Analysts)】\nJust, Jamal, I wanted to kind of pin you down a bit on the tax rate, at least on the income statement. I think in the past, you've said 10% to 15%, and it will probably creep towards the high end of that range. What -- I mean, is that commentary still hold with the combined company in the next year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jamal Baksh (Executives)】\nYes, definitely. I mean, the tax rate at TSS average is probably higher than what's CSI's was, so it -- that wouldn't bring it down by anyway -- it's not -- material enough to bring it outside of that range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Penner (Analysts)】\nOkay, and lastly, the -- any worthwhile commentary on what would give rise to the bargain purchase gain in the quarter? Is that more of an accounting construct than anything else?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jamal Baksh (Executives)】\nYes. Again, it's just an acquisition we found, where the assets weren't of value to the seller, better of value to us.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Leonard (Executives)】\nThank you for joining the Q4 call. And we are always happy to meet with shareholders. So if you'd like to meet in person, just give us a call and we'll make the time to see you at our office. Goodbye now, and we'll talk to you on the Q1 call. Thank you, Melanie.",

      "transcript_text1": "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our analyst conference call. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome those who are viewing the conference via webcast. Together with Roland Iff, I am pleased to report to you on another very successful year for Geberit. Our presentation is structured as follows: first, I will give you a retrospective overview of 2013, and comment on sales development over the past year. Roland Iff will then present the financial results. Thereafter, I will introduce the most important new products we will launch this year, and give you an overview of prospects for both the construction industry and Geberit. We will then summarize and take your questions.\r\nIn 2013, the Geberit Group was able to further improve the already very solid results achieved in the previous year. Sales amounted to CHF 2.29 billion, corresponding to an increase of 3.6% in local currencies. The operating cash flow improved by 10.5%, reaching CHF 593 million. At 25.9%, the EBITDA margin exceeded our midterm target corridor of 23% to 25%. The operating results also significantly increased by 11.9% to CHF 511 million, despite increased personnel expenses and maintenance costs. The EBIT margin reached 22.3%. The net income increased by 12.5% to CHF 436 million, corresponding to a margin of 19% on sales. The earnings per share increased by 14.1% to CHF 11.59. At CHF 444 million, the free cash flow exceeded last year's excellent performance by roughly 14%. The free cash flow was mainly used for shareholder payouts amounting to CHF 248 million. \r\nFor 2013, the Board of Directors proposed a distribution of CHF 7.50 per share to be distributed as regular dividends. This corresponds to an increase of about 14%. The Board of Directors decided on a maximum 5% share buyback program to be executed over the next 2 years. This corresponds to a buyback volume of around CHF 530 million. \r\nLast year, we introduced various new products. Among others, we successfully launched the new shower toilet AquaClean Sela in April. With its simple and modern form, the appearance of a normal toilet bowl and the innovative technology inside, it's a very convincing product. Following initial supply shortages, we will be able to exploit the full potential of this product in 2014. \r\nOur portfolio of actuator plates was completed. The Sigma10 family, pictured on the left, include the full range for our WCs and urinals, and has been certified as water efficiency at the highest level. Furthermore, it allows touchless flush activation. The new design of the Sigma50, picture on the right, now comes with a frameless plate. \r\nBesides the convincing weight reduction, the new electric welding machine for drainage pipes also allows for faster change of tools. The new version of the Geberit Pluvia roof-drainage system combines the existing advantages with a significant noise emission reduction. \r\nThe total environmental impact declined by 2.1%, despite currency-adjusted group-wide sales growth of 3.6%. We also achieved a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption by 2.7%, respectively, 3.5% versus the previous year. It's also worth noting that the Geberit recycled 84% of all production-related waste. \r\n8 apprentices and 2 custodians spent 2 weeks in Bucharest hospice for seriously ill children and adults. During their stay, they installed the sanitary infrastructure in the newly built hospice. In addition, they voluntarily supported the patients. The project was planned, funded and carried out on-site by Geberit. \r\nAdditionally, Geberit's cooperation with the, development organization, HELVETAS, was also continued. \r\nLast year, Geberit invested roughly CHF 100 million or 4.3% of sales. This corresponds to an increase of 14% versus the previous year. Capacity expansions and modernizations each represented 1/3 of the total investments. Investments into rationalizations and new products each accounted for 1/6 of the total investment. I would like to continue by introducing a few selected investment projects. \r\nIn India, our new production plant in Pune started its production activities. The plant produces concealed cisterns that are customized to meet the needs of the Indian markets. Overall, the investment for the plant build-up amounted to CHF 10 million. \r\nIn Ruse, Slovenia, we broke ground for a new plant in April. The investment will amount to CHF 18 million. We also started with the expansion of our Italian plant in Villadose. The total investment into this extension will add up to CHF 15 million. \r\nOrganic growth and the rollout of growth initiatives contributed to a further increase of the headcount. Overall, the number of employees at the end of the year 2013 increased by 92, respectively, 1.5% and reaching 6,226 employees. Sales per employee also increased to CHF 368,500. This correspond to a plus of 3.6%. \r\nBesides investments in innovation, sustainability, production plants and all employees, the close relation to our customers remains as an essential element of Geberit's success formula. \r\nLast year, roughly 30,000 customers came to our 25 training centers for initial and follow-up trainings. Roughly 80,000 customers participated in more than 1,000 external events. We were present at important 15 trade fairs, and we introduced sales apps that bring additional value to our customers. \r\nAs we already presented and commented on our 2013 sales figures at our conference call in January, I will concentrate on the essential. \r\nIn addition to the organic growth of CHF 79 million or 3.6% in local currencies, a positive currency effect of CHF 25 million, or 1.1%, contributed to the growth. Overall sales increased by CHF 104 million, or 4.7%. \r\nIn the second half of the year, sales increased at a high pace compared to the first 6 months. As in previous years, most markets in Europe were able to achieve sales increases in local currencies, overall, by 3.7%. The development was not uniform in the other regions. \r\nIn the Middle East/Africa, sales increased by a strong 23.8%, while sales in local currencies declined in America and Far East/Pacific by 0.8%, and, respectively, 3.8%. After currency adjustments, sales in Europe increased by 3.7% to CHF 2.1 billion. The majority of European markets posted positive growth rates in local currencies. The U.K. even delivered a strong double-digit growth. We had to accept negative currency-adjusted growth rates in Benelux, Italy and Austria, mainly due to their relatively weak construction sector. We have outperformed the broader construction industry development in most European markets. \r\nIn Germany, the comparatively good market development has been repeatedly exceeded. The construction industry in Switzerland is running at full capacity and is, therefore, not growing. \r\nIn the Benelux countries, the situation has not improved. The volume of construction remains well below the precrisis level in Italy. \r\nIn Central/Eastern Europe, a challenging business environment prevails. Since the second quarter of last year, the construction volume in Austria has been in a decline. \r\nWe experienced a mixed picture regarding the market development in Scandinavia. The lack of consumer confidence in France is reflected in the construction industry, and Geberit clearly outperformed the market development in the U.K. And on the Iberian Peninsula, the positive development for Geberit was related to the stability of our local organization. \r\nAs in the previous year, we achieved a double-digit sales growth in the North American residential construction sector. In contrast, the public sector, being the most important for Geberit, experienced negative sales growth due to the declining investments. In the Far East/Pacific region, a general cooldown of sales growth could be observed. We recorded double-digit growth rates in India. In Australia, we achieved moderate growth. And at the same time, we suffered a reduction of sales in China. Driven by the lower sales in China, we ended up with a sales reduction by 3.8% in local currencies for the region. \r\nIn contrast to Asia, a pronounced positive sales growth prevailed in most of our markets in the Middle East/Africa region. I would like to emphasize the double-digit growth rates in the Gulf region, in South Africa and Israel. Overall, the region posted an impressive sales growth of 23.8% in local currencies. \r\nI now come to sales growth in the products areas. Both product areas grew at a similar extent. The Sanitary Systems generated sales growth of 4.4% to CHF 1.3 billion. The Piping Systems grew sales by 5.2%, reaching nearly CHF 1 billion. The product line with the high sales, installation systems, developed more favorably with a sales growth of 5.2% in local currencies. \r\nWithin Piping Systems, building drainage systems enjoyed the strongest development with 5.1% sales growth. \r\nRoland Iff will now lead you through the financial results.\n\n---\n\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. In 2013, the Geberit Group can, once again, present a very solid result. Despite the challenging market conditions, sales development measured in local currencies was only slightly below our midterm corridor, and our operating margins are significantly above our midterm target figure. I'll start my presentation with an overview of the key figures. \r\nOverall, sales increased from CHF 2,187,800 to CHF 2,291,600, corresponding to a 4.7% increase. After a few years with negative currency effects, in 2013, exchange rates had a positive impact on sales in Swiss francs again. Changes in exchange rates positively influenced sales by CHF 25 million, which supported growth by 1.1%. \r\nThe individual currencies developed inconsistently in the reporting period, while the euro, as main currency -- we make about 72% of our sales in euro -- gained 2%, for example, the U.S. dollar and the British pound lost 1% and 2%, respectively. \r\nDue to our limited exposure, the weakening of some emerging market currencies only had a small negative impact on sales. However, it negatively impacted our Q4 financial results. \r\nThe operating cash flow and operating results increased over-proportional and the net income and EPS also increased at double-digit rates, growing faster than sales. At CHF 436 million, net income margin reached 19%. And with CHF 444 million, we were also able to, once again, significantly increase our free cash flow. \r\nIn order to ensure comparability of the numbers,  the previous year numbers had to be restated due to the introduction of the new accounting or revised accounting standard, IAS 19, which is related to pension accounting. Personnel expenses 2012, therefore, had to be increased by CHF 6 million, and therefore, the restated EBITDA margin 2012 is 0.3 percentage point lower than the number reported here 1 year ago. \r\nThe results in detail. In 2013, the EBITDA margin increased by 140 basis points to 25.9%. In absolute terms, EBITDA grew by CHF 56.2 million, or 10.5%. On EBIT level, the increase was CHF 54.2 million or 11.9%. \r\nIn the reporting period, the overall favorable currency development impacted the operating results slightly positively as well for the first time in a few years. At previous year's rates, the EBIT would have been CHF 2.4 million lower. In 2012, we still had to report a currency-related EBIT decrease of CHF 8 million. \r\nWith an increase of 1.6 percentage points, the previous year's EBIT margin was exceeded also in the fourth quarter. With the exception of the second quarter, we could increase profitability in all other quarters. \r\nComing to the individual cost elements. Due to a favorable volume development and shift in our market mix, the customer bonus quota increased also slightly in 2013, as it already did in 2012. Material cost, as a percentage of sales, decreased from 27% to 26.1%, also due to slightly lower raw material prices. The purchasing prices declined throughout the year, however, in Q4, this trend slowed down significantly. \r\nAn increase versus previous year was recorded in personnel cost. The cost increase of 1.3% is in line with the increase in the workforce, which grew by 1% or 64 employees on average. Further cost increases for tariffs last year around 2%, and slightly higher bonuses for employees and management were compensated by lower pension-related expenses and lower cost for our share participation programs. The additional employees, due to the volume growth, were mainly recruited in the European production and sales companies. \r\nMarketing expenses, which in the last year was due to the AquaClean campaign and growth initiatives, have been growing significantly, were down by almost 4% in 2013. In total, other operating expenses increased by 3.6%, which is slightly less than the 2013 sales growth. \r\nThe analysis of the EBIT margin development summarizes what I mentioned before. The volume increase resulted in the margin increase of 0.6%. The mix in 2013 was almost neutral. The previously mentioned increase in operating expenses led to a negative effect of minus 0.3%. Positive currency movements had a partially compensating effect. The overall net margin effect between sales and purchasing prices in 2013 was positive, and more than compensated the negative effects from the increase in sales reductions. All in all, EBIT margin increased by 1.4 percentage points compared to previous year. \r\nNet income reached CHF 435.8 million, corresponding to an increase of 12.5% versus previous year. This, compared to the operating results, over-proportional increase is attributed to a slightly lower tax rate and an improved financial result. The financial result is largely better than last year, as it was positively influenced by lower interest expenses due to the full repayment of the U.S. dollar debt at the end of 2012. \r\nLoss on foreign currency positions had a partly compensating effect. The over-proportional EPS growth of 14.1% to CHF 11.59 is driven by the share buyback that was completed in 2012. \r\nAt CHF 444 million, Geberit achieved free cash flow well above the previous year. Besides the development of the operating cash flow, a favorable development of the net working capital was the main driver of the over-proportional increase in free cash flow. Despite the growth in sales, which was mainly generated in the second half of the year, net working capital decreased in the fourth quarter. \r\nInvestments. Intangible assets were CHF 10 million, above the lower -- somewhat low previous year's level, mainly due to the already mentioned production-related projects. \r\nAs of 31 December, 2013, the balance sheet included a substantial higher cash position compared to the previous year, as the only distribution was a dividend payment of CHF 248 million. Net liquidity increased, therefore, by about CHF 200 million to CHF 601.1 million. \r\nPension liabilities, on the other hand, decreased. This is, on the one hand, the result of higher interest rates, and on the other hand due to the, again, improved capital coverage of the Swiss pension plans. The equity ratio increased again last year. After 71.3% at the end of 2012, it now reached 74.8%. The financing of the group remains very solid, and we continue to have a basis for an attractive payout policy. \r\nBased on this solid financial situation, the Board of Directors is proposing to the Annual General Meeting a payout of CHF 7.50 per share. This corresponds to an increase in payout of around 14% versus the previous year. On that basis, CHF 283.5 million will be distributed corresponding to a payout ratio of 65.1%. \r\nAs the group no longer holds significant capital contribution reserves, this year's payout shall be distributed as an ordinary dividend only, which will be fully subject to withholding tax. The Annual General Meeting will be held on April 3, and subject to the approval by the general meeting, the dividend will be paid out on April 10. \r\nIn addition, the Board of Directors has approved a further share buyback program. On a second trading line and split over 2 years, 5% of the share capital will be repurchased with a purpose to cancel the shares thereafter. \r\nOn the basis of the current stock market valuation, the repurchasing volume amounts to approximately CHF 530 million. The preparation for the buyback program will be started immediately together with the Zurcher Kantonalbank. We assume that we will be able to start the program in about 2 months from now. \r\nWith this, I would like to give the word back to Albert Baehny.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Roland for the good numbers. As last year, we will launch numerous new products in 2014. Developed especially for the Chinese markets and focused on the growing middle class, we will introduce the Monolith washbasin module that is entirely produced in China. The module is space-saving, fully equipped and ready-to-install. The module is available in 3 color options, and 4 options each for the ceramic basin and for the faucet. \r\nOn the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first Geberit concealed cisterns, we will introduce the Omega flushing system with a corresponding Omega concealed cisterns and Omega actuator plates. With 3 different cistern heights and extra small actuator plates that can be mounted at the front or on top, depending on construction situation, the Omega flushing system offers maximum flexibility. \r\nFloor-even showers are very trendy. The innovative wall drain that was introduced by Geberit in 2011 allows location of the drainage in the wall. The new and revised Geberit wall drain is even less obtrusive, slimmer and can be easily installed almost anywhere. \r\nThe Geberit Monolith WC module has enjoyed great popularity since its introduction in 2010. This year, we will introduce the Geberit Monolith Plus. In addition to the flushing system, it includes odor extraction directly from the toilet bowl, programmable orientation lighting and electronic flush activation. \r\nOur R&D department applies computer simulations, for example, to improve the flow behaviors of our water drainage systems. One example of that research is the new patented Geberit Sovent fitting, which increases the flow performance by 40%. It permits the use of relatively small-sized discharge stacks even in a very high building, and thus allows to save space and reduce costs. \r\nAfter this short tour through the new Geberit products, allow me now to comment on the outlook in the building industry. \r\nIn Europe, we expect a further decline on the construction volume. The best prospects are in residential building, both for renovation and new buildings. The outlook varies from market-to-market. We are anticipating positive growth in Germany and Great Britain. In Switzerland, the construction industry is operating at full capacity. We foresee a mixed picture with uncertainty in Austria, Belgium and Scandinavia. We expect further declines in France, the Netherlands, Southern Europe, as well as in Central/Eastern Europe. \r\nFor North America, we expect the continuation of the ongoing recovery in the residential building sector. Currently, the construction volume remains substantially below their long-term average, despite last year's recovery. On the other hand, non-residential construction still presents an unclear picture. While we expect positive development for the private sector, the outlook for the public sector remains uncertain. \r\nAfter the slowdown of growth in 2013, we again expect a single-digit growth rate in China. In the case of India, we continue to be optimistic and expect positive growth rates in both residential, as well as commercial construction. \r\nIn Southeast Asia, we also foresee a continued positive trend, however, with local differences. \r\nFor Australia, we expect positive development on the building sector. \r\nDespite the ongoing difficult political situation in North Africa, we remain overall positive for the Middle East/Africa region. We especially see positive growth prospects for the Gulf region and South Africa. \r\nFollowing this assessment of the markets, I would like now to give you an outlook on the coming year at Geberit. In 1964, Geberit introduced the concealed cistern. Since then, the cistern hidden behind a wall, has changed flushing technology more than any other product. In the last 50 years, Geberit has delivered more than 60 million concealed cisterns, and thus enabled a totally new design in millions of bathrooms. Over time, the continued development has led to installation systems that are a major pillar in today's Geberit product portfolio.\r\nThis year, we will celebrate its anniversary with gala events in 6 European cities. \r\nThe newly built production facility in Ruse, Slovenia will replace the current existing plant, which we moved into in 1965. As already mentioned in the review,  the groundbreaking of the new plant took place in April last year. Today, the new facility is already considered a reference for green production in Slovenia. In parallel, new production flows would increase the productivity. The new plant should start production in the third quarter of this year. \r\nAnd every year, we will initiate and implement a series of important initiatives to meet our ambition of continuously optimizing our business processes. Optimization in production and logistics are targeted in various projects. With technology upgrades in the IT environment, we are staying up-to-date and we will pilot the shift of collaboration tools, as well as the CRM system to a cloud-based technology. With our initiative, Geberit Digital, we are currently working on optimizing our digital presence on search engines. \r\nInnovation. We'll continue to enjoy a high focus this year. We aim to guarantee a strong and stable product pipeline throughout the upcoming years. Our tradition of social engagement projects will be continued this year, with the support of a center for the education and rehabilitation of children and youngsters in Varanasi, India. \r\nNow I'd like to conclude by summarizing our presentation. \r\nGeberit again outperformed the market in 2013, and delivered strong financial results. The newly introduced products proved to be growth drivers. Further increases in productivity, once again, ensured a competitive cost structure. This can only be realized year-by-year through state-of-the-art production and logistics processes. Overall, we confirm our strong and sustainable cash generation ability. We remain very careful in our assessment of the construction industry outlook for 2014. We anticipate an overall weakening of the construction sector in Europe. In Asia, we expect a moderate single-digit growth for China, while we see a reduced but positive growth in India. We remain confident for the markets in the Middle East and South Africa. And for North America, we anticipate a solid recovery, especially in residential construction. \r\nI am convinced that Geberit's fundamental values represent an exceptionally solid basis for the further development of the company. We are positively positioned in Europe, with a strong position in those markets with a positive outlook. We offer a wide range of new products, and also have dedicated solutions for developing countries. We've proven that we are able to grow profitably even under difficult market conditions. The continuous optimization of our business processes and a clear focus on cost will enable us to continue to operate profitably in the future. Our strong cash generation ability remains undiminished for the future. \r\nBeside this trusting cooperation with our partners, the entire management places great value on a sustainable leadership of the company. \r\nYear-over-year, we generate positive organic sales growth in local currencies, except in 2009. We have achieved our midterm growth targets over the last 5 years despite the severe crisis since, 2009. The quality of the sales growth is very important, and during this 11 years period, the EBITDA margin remained at a very high level, with a peak of 28% in 2009. \r\nWith both sales growth and operating margins, we are outperforming the construction sector. Investments, intangible assets, research and market development lead to different levels of return on capital and, therefore, create different amounts of value. This slide is showing that we are investing on average CHF 100 million of CapEx per year at a stable return on investment capital rates, which exceeded 30% for the first time last year. \r\nOn top of these investments, we massively increased our marketing budget over the last few years from CHF 58 million in 2007 to CHF 84 million in 2013. The R&D budget was constant around CHF 50 million. We aim to achieve both sales growth and an attractive return on invested capital. \r\nWe have significantly outperformed the Swiss market index over the last 11 years and have returned more than CHF 1 billion to our shareholders over the last 3 years. Our coherent payout ratio policy is between 50% to 70% of net income. At the end of this year, I will step out of my CEO role, and Christian Buhl will take over this beautiful responsibility. Christian Buhl is a Swiss citizen, 40 years old, he studied physics at the ETH in Zürich. He has a PhD from the University of St. Gallen, he spent 5 years at McKinsey, and since 2009, he is with Geberit, and currently, he is managing the Sales and Marketing team in Germany. We will be happy to inform you again regarding the further development of our results on the listed dates. Many thanks for your attention. Roland Iff and myself, we're all glad to answer your questions.",

We will then summarize and take your questions.\r\nIn 2013, the Geberit Group was able to further improve the already very solid results achieved in the previous year. Sales amounted to CHF 2.29 billion, corresponding to an increase of 3.6% in local currencies. The operating cash flow improved by 10.5%, reaching CHF 593 million. At 25.9%, the EBITDA margin exceeded our midterm target corridor of 23% to 25%. The operating results also significantly increased by 11.9% to CHF 511 million, despite increased personnel expenses and maintenance costs. The EBIT margin reached 22.3%. The net income increased by 12.5% to CHF 436 million, corresponding to a margin of 19% on sales. The earnings per share increased by 14.1% to CHF 11.59. At CHF 444 million, the free cash flow exceeded last year's excellent performance by roughly 14%. The free cash flow was mainly used for shareholder payouts amounting to CHF 248 million. \r\nFor 2013, the Board of Directors proposed a distribution of CHF 7.50 per share to be distributed as regular dividends. This corresponds to an increase of about 14%. The Board of Directors decided on a maximum 5% share buyback program to be executed over the next 2 years. This corresponds to a buyback volume of around CHF 530 million. \r\nLast year, we introduced various new products. Among others, we successfully launched the new shower toilet AquaClean Sela in April. With its simple and modern form, the appearance of a normal toilet bowl and the innovative technology inside, it's a very convincing product. Following initial supply shortages, we will be able to exploit the full potential of this product in 2014. \r\nOur portfolio of actuator plates was completed. The Sigma10 family, pictured on the left, include the full range for our WCs and urinals, and has been certified as water efficiency at the highest level. Furthermore, it allows touchless flush activation. The new design of the Sigma50, picture on the right, now comes with a frameless plate. \r\nBesides the convincing weight reduction, the new electric welding machine for drainage pipes also allows for faster change of tools. The new version of the Geberit Pluvia roof-drainage system combines the existing advantages with a significant noise emission reduction. \r\nThe total environmental impact declined by 2.1%, despite currency-adjusted group-wide sales growth of 3.6%. We also achieved a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption by 2.7%, respectively, 3.5% versus the previous year. It's also worth noting that the Geberit recycled 84% of all production-related waste. \r\n8 apprentices and 2 custodians spent 2 weeks in Bucharest hospice for seriously ill children and adults. During their stay, they installed the sanitary infrastructure in the newly built hospice. In addition, they voluntarily supported the patients. The project was planned, funded and carried out on-site by Geberit. \r\nAdditionally, Geberit's cooperation with the, development organization, HELVETAS, was also continued. \r\nLast year, Geberit invested roughly CHF 100 million or 4.3% of sales. This corresponds to an increase of 14% versus the previous year. Capacity expansions and modernizations each represented 1/3 of the total investments. Investments into rationalizations and new products each accounted for 1/6 of the total investment. I would like to continue by introducing a few selected investment projects. \r\nIn India, our new production plant in Pune started its production activities. The plant produces concealed cisterns that are customized to meet the needs of the Indian markets. Overall, the investment for the plant build-up amounted to CHF 10 million. \r\nIn Ruse, Slovenia, we broke ground for a new plant in April. The investment will amount to CHF 18 million. We also started with the expansion of our Italian plant in Villadose. The total investment into this extension will add up to CHF 15 million. \r\nOrganic growth and the rollout of growth initiatives contributed to a further increase of the headcount. Overall, the number of employees at the end of the year 2013 increased by 92, respectively, 1.5% and reaching 6,226 employees. Sales per employee also increased to CHF 368,500. This correspond to a plus of 3.6%. \r\nBesides investments in innovation, sustainability, production plants and all employees, the close relation to our customers remains as an essential element of Geberit's success formula. \r\nLast year, roughly 30,000 customers came to our 25 training centers for initial and follow-up trainings. Roughly 80,000 customers participated in more than 1,000 external events. We were present at important 15 trade fairs, and we introduced sales apps that bring additional value to our customers. \r\nAs we already presented and commented on our 2013 sales figures at our conference call in January, I will concentrate on the essential. \r\nIn addition to the organic growth of CHF 79 million or 3.6% in local currencies, a positive currency effect of CHF 25 million, or 1.1%, contributed to the growth. Overall sales increased by CHF 104 million, or 4.7%. \r\nIn the second half of the year, sales increased at a high pace compared to the first 6 months. As in previous years, most markets in Europe were able to achieve sales increases in local currencies, overall, by 3.7%. The development was not uniform in the other regions. \r\nIn the Middle East/Africa, sales increased by a strong 23.8%, while sales in local currencies declined in America and Far East/Pacific by 0.8%, and, respectively, 3.8%. After currency adjustments, sales in Europe increased by 3.7% to CHF 2.1 billion. The majority of European markets posted positive growth rates in local currencies. The U.K. even delivered a strong double-digit growth. We had to accept negative currency-adjusted growth rates in Benelux, Italy and Austria, mainly due to their relatively weak construction sector. We have outperformed the broader construction industry development in most European markets. \r\nIn Germany, the comparatively good market development has been repeatedly exceeded. The construction industry in Switzerland is running at full capacity and is, therefore, not growing. \r\nIn the Benelux countries, the situation has not improved. The volume of construction remains well below the precrisis level in Italy. \r\nIn Central/Eastern Europe, a challenging business environment prevails. Since the second quarter of last year, the construction volume in Austria has been in a decline. \r\nWe experienced a mixed picture regarding the market development in Scandinavia. The lack of consumer confidence in France is reflected in the construction industry, and Geberit clearly outperformed the market development in the U.K. And on the Iberian Peninsula, the positive development for Geberit was related to the stability of our local organization. \r\nAs in the previous year, we achieved a double-digit sales growth in the North American residential construction sector. In contrast, the public sector, being the most important for Geberit, experienced negative sales growth due to the declining investments. In the Far East/Pacific region, a general cooldown of sales growth could be observed. We recorded double-digit growth rates in India. In Australia, we achieved moderate growth. And at the same time, we suffered a reduction of sales in China. Driven by the lower sales in China, we ended up with a sales reduction by 3.8% in local currencies for the region. \r\nIn contrast to Asia, a pronounced positive sales growth prevailed in most of our markets in the Middle East/Africa region. I would like to emphasize the double-digit growth rates in the Gulf region, in South Africa and Israel. Overall, the region posted an impressive sales growth of 23.8% in local currencies. \r\nI now come to sales growth in the products areas. Both product areas grew at a similar extent. The Sanitary Systems generated sales growth of 4.4% to CHF 1.3 billion. The Piping Systems grew sales by 5.2%, reaching nearly CHF 1 billion. The product line with the high sales, installation systems, developed more favorably with a sales growth of 5.2% in local currencies. \r\nWithin Piping Systems, building drainage systems enjoyed the strongest development with 5.1% sales growth. \r\nRoland Iff will now lead you through the financial results.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Roland Iff (Executives)】\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. In 2013, the Geberit Group can, once again, present a very solid result. Despite the challenging market conditions, sales development measured in local currencies was only slightly below our midterm corridor, and our operating margins are significantly above our midterm target figure. I'll start my presentation with an overview of the key figures. \r\nOverall, sales increased from CHF 2,187,800 to CHF 2,291,600, corresponding to a 4.7% increase. After a few years with negative currency effects, in 2013, exchange rates had a positive impact on sales in Swiss francs again. Changes in exchange rates positively influenced sales by CHF 25 million, which supported growth by 1.1%. \r\nThe individual currencies developed inconsistently in the reporting period, while the euro, as main currency -- we make about 72% of our sales in euro -- gained 2%, for example, the U.S. dollar and the British pound lost 1% and 2%, respectively. \r\nDue to our limited exposure, the weakening of some emerging market currencies only had a small negative impact on sales. However, it negatively impacted our Q4 financial results. \r\nThe operating cash flow and operating results increased over-proportional and the net income and EPS also increased at double-digit rates, growing faster than sales. At CHF 436 million, net income margin reached 19%. And with CHF 444 million, we were also able to, once again, significantly increase our free cash flow. \r\nIn order to ensure comparability of the numbers,  the previous year numbers had to be restated due to the introduction of the new accounting or revised accounting standard, IAS 19, which is related to pension accounting. Personnel expenses 2012, therefore, had to be increased by CHF 6 million, and therefore, the restated EBITDA margin 2012 is 0.3 percentage point lower than the number reported here 1 year ago. \r\nThe results in detail. In 2013, the EBITDA margin increased by 140 basis points to 25.9%. In absolute terms, EBITDA grew by CHF 56.2 million, or 10.5%. On EBIT level, the increase was CHF 54.2 million or 11.9%. \r\nIn the reporting period, the overall favorable currency development impacted the operating results slightly positively as well for the first time in a few years. At previous year's rates, the EBIT would have been CHF 2.4 million lower. In 2012, we still had to report a currency-related EBIT decrease of CHF 8 million. \r\nWith an increase of 1.6 percentage points, the previous year's EBIT margin was exceeded also in the fourth quarter. With the exception of the second quarter, we could increase profitability in all other quarters. \r\nComing to the individual cost elements. Due to a favorable volume development and shift in our market mix, the customer bonus quota increased also slightly in 2013, as it already did in 2012. Material cost, as a percentage of sales, decreased from 27% to 26.1%, also due to slightly lower raw material prices. The purchasing prices declined throughout the year, however, in Q4, this trend slowed down significantly. \r\nAn increase versus previous year was recorded in personnel cost. The cost increase of 1.3% is in line with the increase in the workforce, which grew by 1% or 64 employees on average. Further cost increases for tariffs last year around 2%, and slightly higher bonuses for employees and management were compensated by lower pension-related expenses and lower cost for our share participation programs. The additional employees, due to the volume growth, were mainly recruited in the European production and sales companies. \r\nMarketing expenses, which in the last year was due to the AquaClean campaign and growth initiatives, have been growing significantly, were down by almost 4% in 2013. In total, other operating expenses increased by 3.6%, which is slightly less than the 2013 sales growth. \r\nThe analysis of the EBIT margin development summarizes what I mentioned before. The volume increase resulted in the margin increase of 0.6%. The mix in 2013 was almost neutral. The previously mentioned increase in operating expenses led to a negative effect of minus 0.3%. Positive currency movements had a partially compensating effect. The overall net margin effect between sales and purchasing prices in 2013 was positive, and more than compensated the negative effects from the increase in sales reductions. All in all, EBIT margin increased by 1.4 percentage points compared to previous year. \r\nNet income reached CHF 435.8 million, corresponding to an increase of 12.5% versus previous year. This, compared to the operating results, over-proportional increase is attributed to a slightly lower tax rate and an improved financial result. The financial result is largely better than last year, as it was positively influenced by lower interest expenses due to the full repayment of the U.S. dollar debt at the end of 2012. \r\nLoss on foreign currency positions had a partly compensating effect. The over-proportional EPS growth of 14.1% to CHF 11.59 is driven by the share buyback that was completed in 2012. \r\nAt CHF 444 million, Geberit achieved free cash flow well above the previous year. Besides the development of the operating cash flow, a favorable development of the net working capital was the main driver of the over-proportional increase in free cash flow. Despite the growth in sales, which was mainly generated in the second half of the year, net working capital decreased in the fourth quarter. \r\nInvestments. Intangible assets were CHF 10 million, above the lower -- somewhat low previous year's level, mainly due to the already mentioned production-related projects. \r\nAs of 31 December, 2013, the balance sheet included a substantial higher cash position compared to the previous year, as the only distribution was a dividend payment of CHF 248 million. Net liquidity increased, therefore, by about CHF 200 million to CHF 601.1 million. \r\nPension liabilities, on the other hand, decreased. This is, on the one hand, the result of higher interest rates, and on the other hand due to the, again, improved capital coverage of the Swiss pension plans. The equity ratio increased again last year. After 71.3% at the end of 2012, it now reached 74.8%. The financing of the group remains very solid, and we continue to have a basis for an attractive payout policy. \r\nBased on this solid financial situation, the Board of Directors is proposing to the Annual General Meeting a payout of CHF 7.50 per share. This corresponds to an increase in payout of around 14% versus the previous year. On that basis, CHF 283.5 million will be distributed corresponding to a payout ratio of 65.1%. \r\nAs the group no longer holds significant capital contribution reserves, this year's payout shall be distributed as an ordinary dividend only, which will be fully subject to withholding tax. The Annual General Meeting will be held on April 3, and subject to the approval by the general meeting, the dividend will be paid out on April 10. \r\nIn addition, the Board of Directors has approved a further share buyback program. On a second trading line and split over 2 years, 5% of the share capital will be repurchased with a purpose to cancel the shares thereafter. \r\nOn the basis of the current stock market valuation, the repurchasing volume amounts to approximately CHF 530 million. The preparation for the buyback program will be started immediately together with the Zurcher Kantonalbank. We assume that we will be able to start the program in about 2 months from now. \r\nWith this, I would like to give the word back to Albert Baehny.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nThank you, Roland for the good numbers. As last year, we will launch numerous new products in 2014. Developed especially for the Chinese markets and focused on the growing middle class, we will introduce the Monolith washbasin module that is entirely produced in China. The module is space-saving, fully equipped and ready-to-install. The module is available in 3 color options, and 4 options each for the ceramic basin and for the faucet. \r\nOn the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first Geberit concealed cisterns, we will introduce the Omega flushing system with a corresponding Omega concealed cisterns and Omega actuator plates. With 3 different cistern heights and extra small actuator plates that can be mounted at the front or on top, depending on construction situation, the Omega flushing system offers maximum flexibility. \r\nFloor-even showers are very trendy. The innovative wall drain that was introduced by Geberit in 2011 allows location of the drainage in the wall. The new and revised Geberit wall drain is even less obtrusive, slimmer and can be easily installed almost anywhere. \r\nThe Geberit Monolith WC module has enjoyed great popularity since its introduction in 2010. This year, we will introduce the Geberit Monolith Plus. In addition to the flushing system, it includes odor extraction directly from the toilet bowl, programmable orientation lighting and electronic flush activation. \r\nOur R&D department applies computer simulations, for example, to improve the flow behaviors of our water drainage systems. One example of that research is the new patented Geberit Sovent fitting, which increases the flow performance by 40%. It permits the use of relatively small-sized discharge stacks even in a very high building, and thus allows to save space and reduce costs. \r\nAfter this short tour through the new Geberit products, allow me now to comment on the outlook in the building industry. \r\nIn Europe, we expect a further decline on the construction volume. The best prospects are in residential building, both for renovation and new buildings. The outlook varies from market-to-market. We are anticipating positive growth in Germany and Great Britain. In Switzerland, the construction industry is operating at full capacity. We foresee a mixed picture with uncertainty in Austria, Belgium and Scandinavia. We expect further declines in France, the Netherlands, Southern Europe, as well as in Central/Eastern Europe. \r\nFor North America, we expect the continuation of the ongoing recovery in the residential building sector. Currently, the construction volume remains substantially below their long-term average, despite last year's recovery. On the other hand, non-residential construction still presents an unclear picture. While we expect positive development for the private sector, the outlook for the public sector remains uncertain. \r\nAfter the slowdown of growth in 2013, we again expect a single-digit growth rate in China. In the case of India, we continue to be optimistic and expect positive growth rates in both residential, as well as commercial construction. \r\nIn Southeast Asia, we also foresee a continued positive trend, however, with local differences. \r\nFor Australia, we expect positive development on the building sector. \r\nDespite the ongoing difficult political situation in North Africa, we remain overall positive for the Middle East/Africa region. We especially see positive growth prospects for the Gulf region and South Africa. \r\nFollowing this assessment of the markets, I would like now to give you an outlook on the coming year at Geberit. In 1964, Geberit introduced the concealed cistern. Since then, the cistern hidden behind a wall, has changed flushing technology more than any other product. In the last 50 years, Geberit has delivered more than 60 million concealed cisterns, and thus enabled a totally new design in millions of bathrooms. Over time, the continued development has led to installation systems that are a major pillar in today's Geberit product portfolio.\r\nThis year, we will celebrate its anniversary with gala events in 6 European cities. \r\nThe newly built production facility in Ruse, Slovenia will replace the current existing plant, which we moved into in 1965. As already mentioned in the review,  the groundbreaking of the new plant took place in April last year. Today, the new facility is already considered a reference for green production in Slovenia. In parallel, new production flows would increase the productivity. The new plant should start production in the third quarter of this year. \r\nAnd every year, we will initiate and implement a series of important initiatives to meet our ambition of continuously optimizing our business processes. Optimization in production and logistics are targeted in various projects. With technology upgrades in the IT environment, we are staying up-to-date and we will pilot the shift of collaboration tools, as well as the CRM system to a cloud-based technology. With our initiative, Geberit Digital, we are currently working on optimizing our digital presence on search engines. \r\nInnovation. We'll continue to enjoy a high focus this year. We aim to guarantee a strong and stable product pipeline throughout the upcoming years. Our tradition of social engagement projects will be continued this year, with the support of a center for the education and rehabilitation of children and youngsters in Varanasi, India. \r\nNow I'd like to conclude by summarizing our presentation. \r\nGeberit again outperformed the market in 2013, and delivered strong financial results. The newly introduced products proved to be growth drivers. Further increases in productivity, once again, ensured a competitive cost structure. This can only be realized year-by-year through state-of-the-art production and logistics processes. Overall, we confirm our strong and sustainable cash generation ability. We remain very careful in our assessment of the construction industry outlook for 2014. We anticipate an overall weakening of the construction sector in Europe. In Asia, we expect a moderate single-digit growth for China, while we see a reduced but positive growth in India. We remain confident for the markets in the Middle East and South Africa. And for North America, we anticipate a solid recovery, especially in residential construction. \r\nI am convinced that Geberit's fundamental values represent an exceptionally solid basis for the further development of the company. We are positively positioned in Europe, with a strong position in those markets with a positive outlook. We offer a wide range of new products, and also have dedicated solutions for developing countries. We've proven that we are able to grow profitably even under difficult market conditions. The continuous optimization of our business processes and a clear focus on cost will enable us to continue to operate profitably in the future. Our strong cash generation ability remains undiminished for the future. \r\nBeside this trusting cooperation with our partners, the entire management places great value on a sustainable leadership of the company. \r\nYear-over-year, we generate positive organic sales growth in local currencies, except in 2009. We have achieved our midterm growth targets over the last 5 years despite the severe crisis since, 2009. The quality of the sales growth is very important, and during this 11 years period, the EBITDA margin remained at a very high level, with a peak of 28% in 2009. \r\nWith both sales growth and operating margins, we are outperforming the construction sector. Investments, intangible assets, research and market development lead to different levels of return on capital and, therefore, create different amounts of value. This slide is showing that we are investing on average CHF 100 million of CapEx per year at a stable return on investment capital rates, which exceeded 30% for the first time last year. \r\nOn top of these investments, we massively increased our marketing budget over the last few years from CHF 58 million in 2007 to CHF 84 million in 2013. The R&D budget was constant around CHF 50 million. We aim to achieve both sales growth and an attractive return on invested capital. \r\nWe have significantly outperformed the Swiss market index over the last 11 years and have returned more than CHF 1 billion to our shareholders over the last 3 years. Our coherent payout ratio policy is between 50% to 70% of net income. At the end of this year, I will step out of my CEO role, and Christian Buhl will take over this beautiful responsibility. Christian Buhl is a Swiss citizen, 40 years old, he studied physics at the ETH in Zürich. He has a PhD from the University of St. Gallen, he spent 5 years at McKinsey, and since 2009, he is with Geberit, and currently, he is managing the Sales and Marketing team in Germany. We will be happy to inform you again regarding the further development of our results on the listed dates. Many thanks for your attention. Roland Iff and myself, we're all glad to answer your questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "Michael Roost from Bank am Bellevue. I just have 3 questions, if possible. The first one is on the AquaClean. If I remember correctly, you're not planning to launch it in any new countries in 2014. Or has that changed at all now that the production delays are, let's say, a thing of the past? Second question is on your thoughts, just generally, on the South America. What are your thoughts going forward? And then my third question is on the tax rate. Just if you could give us a bit of an idea for 2014 and then also for the development over the next couple of years, has anything changed in terms of the agreement with Germany? If you could give me an idea there?\n\n---\n\nI'll start at the end. The tax rate for this year should be around 14%, with 15% for the next 2 years in your spreadsheets. And after that, around 18% to 20%. On South America the picture is very clear. It doesn't make sense to try to penetrate this region without any acquisition. The entry buyers are very high. There are few very strong players that are local Geberits, there are very complex tax structure, so without acquisition, no presence of Geberit in this part of the world. And you will certainly ask the question, are we negotiating an acquisition? We are not negotiating, discussing any acquisition currently in South America. Regarding AquaClean, now, we stick to our decision of last year. This year it's a consolidation year. We -- in a few years, we introduce AquaClean in 11 European markets. From time-to-time you need to consolidate to slowdown and this is what we will be doing this year.\n\n---\n\nChristian Arnold, Bank Vontobel. I have also 2 or 3 question. And the first one, on the price effect on Slide 28, you showed the net price effect of 1.7% on the EBIT level. Could you give us the price effect that you had with your products? So how much could you increase the prices on average? And a follow-up question on the same subject, did you also increased prices in Switzerland for the first time since some years? That's one question. The other question, I would have is on systems and mechanisms. Here, we have seen a growth of 2%, roughly. In the past, these product lines always outperformed on the back of shower toilets and other products. As we don't have a limitation on capacities, again, is it a fair assumption to assume that then this product line will again outperform going forward? And then the last question I would have is on the production sites, the new production in Slovenia, I believe, does it have some ramp-up costs this year? And if so, could you quantify that?\n\n---\n\nThere will be no ramp-up costs, specific ramp-up costs this year in Slovenia. So we will be starting the third quarter and it will be, I would say, on an arrogant way, maybe as usual by Geberit, very small. So we have not planned any specific costs plans for this ramp-up of the plant. Regarding your second question, this product line, in this product line you have the AquaClean business. The last few years, we were able to grow the AquaClean business by around 20% annually. Because of supplies, major difficulty this year, we could not generate this 20% growth rates with AquaClean, it was single-digit growth rates. So that impacted basically the momentum of the growth of this product line. And in this product line, you also have the visible cisterns, and the visible cisterns are on a downward trend with negative growth rates. So this is the combined effect, negative growth rates was visible cisterns and the single-digit growth rates only for AquaClean because of supply problems. The price increase last year was around 1.5%, 1.8%.\n\n---\n\nMartin Hüsler, Zurcher Kantonalbank. My question relates to your long-term margin targets. You showed this very impressive track record, and you exceeded the 23% of 25% margin range in 7 out of the last 8 years. I was just wondering what would make you change this range to a higher target or what are your thoughts there? Why do you still stick to this long-term range when you can overachieve it? And, especially for 2014, when we start -- if I look at your forecasts quality-wise, as you gave it, where is the biggest risk that margin could be lower in 2014 than it was in 2013?\n\n---\n\nThis is an indirect very smart question. A bit of history. In 2009, together with Monolith, we were on our way to move up this margin corridor. We did not do it because of the crisis in the building industry. So since then, we are in a very difficult business environment. Just a few numbers, you don't realize it. In Spain, the building volume, the construction volume today is maximum 10% of what it was in 2008 and '07. If you go to Italy, the construction volume is down 50% before the pre-crisis level. If you go to the Netherlands, the construction volume is down 26%, 30% versus the pre-crisis level. So we will be prepared and willing to review this corridor under only one condition, simply better market environment. The construction volume in Europe is at least 30% below what it was before the crisis. So I think we've been very courageous, put it this way, that in this crisis and during this crisis to maintain this corridor and this corridor was basically a pre-crisis corridor. So as long as we are facing this weak building industry in Europe, we will not take the risk, to be honest, to change this corridor and then go to back, go to explain why we've been disappointing you. Wait and see. Now you, of course, you are asking a question about the potential margin in 2014 versus 2013. You know our style. We communicate the first guidance or guidances with each one, not before. So I will stick to this Geberit's rule today as well. Roman?\n\n---\n\nThere are some questions from direct cost. So first question from Remo Rosenau, Neue Helvetische Bank. Have you or will you increase your general price level again in the tune of 1.5% across the board in full year 2014 as it was the case the last few years?\n\n---\n\nThe answer is yes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Then second question is...\n\n---\n\nPrice increase during Q2 and full impact in Q3.\n\n---\n\nSecond question as well from Remo Rosenau. Partly answered already. If I recall correctly, you stopped the introduction of AquaClean in new countries of for this year in order to achieve a stronger penetration in existing markets. Are you satisfied with these efforts? And if yes, how do you measure the rate of success, and will you start to introduce AquaClean in new countries again as of 2014? Or if not, by when will that be the case again?\n\n---\n\nWell, basically, part of the question has been answered. This year it's a consolidation year, and next year, we will add 2 or 3 new countries to these initiatives. And we are just measuring the success of the market penetration through the growth rates. When we started the initiative, we said we want at least, in average, 20% annual growth rates in every single market, and this is basically the benchmark.\n\n---\n\nOkay. The third question if from Alejandra Pereda from Morgan Stanley. First question, your average cost per employee seems to have increased only 1.1%. Can you provide some color on why personnel cost inflation has been so low?\n\n---\n\nWell, first of all, the personnel costs went up for a few reasons. First of all, we had, in average, 16 more employees this year versus previous year. Secondly, we are facing a wage inflation in some markets in particular, in Germany, of at least 3% to 4%. Then we had negative currency impact on the personnel costs and we had a special program at the EMD where we trained our top managers for 1 week and this also put some pressure on our personnel expenses. Want to add something else on that?\n\n---\n\nAnother question was more, why is it so low?\n\n---\n\nYes. But nevertheless it increased.\n\n---\n\nDespite increase is what you said and productivity, It slowed down significantly towards the end of the year because the increase in tariffs for Germany was only for the first 6 months. And there was 3% for 18 months decided in summer 2012 -- sorry, beginning 2012. So the second half of 2013, we didn't suffer from that impact anymore.\n\n---\n\nCorrect.\n\n---\n\nAnd then it was just strict cost management, vacation accruals, overtime accruals, et cetera, maybe done a little bit stricter than in the past, and we saved those on our share participation plans that I have mentioned before about CHF 1 million. That offset some of the increases and last thing was reduction in pension-related expenses due to some changes we made in the Swiss pension plans at the end of 2012.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Second question. Could you tell us what has been the percentage of organic growth in sales of new products versus the rest?\n\n---\n\nJust want to say one thing. If we take the new products we introduced since 2010, then every single new product with the exception of one delivered in 2013 versus 2012, growth rate's between 15% and 20%.\n\n---\n\nThe next question from Aynsley Lammin from Citi. First question, do you expect to increase your market share gains in 2014 compared to 2013?\n\n---\n\nYes. We expect in every single market to outperform the market, and if we can achieve that, then we will be gaining again, market shares, yes.\n\n---\n\nSecond question, are you happy to buy shares at the current share price and do you have any limits or criteria for what share price you are willing to buy shares back at?\n\n---\n\nWell, I mean, this is -- I have often debated with Roland, because I often say, my goodness, it's too expensive. Why are we doing this share buyback? When you look back, we did extremely well. I mean, every time we bought, and the share price went up afterward -- went up afterwards. So we have a very ethical policy when we decide to start the share buyback. We do the share buyback program and we are not looking at -- we're not tempted to use the ups and downs in the markets to accelerate or to decelerate a share buyback program. So we will do it anyway.  We are not speculators. We are long-term investors.\n\n---\n\nI would have some more questions to you, but if someone in the room would interrupt me.\n\n---\n\nJust 2, 3 add-ons. On the tax rate, I mean, you stated to get to target an 18% to 20% tax rate as of 20, what is it, '15, '16, '17, right? Well, that sounded quite concrete. In the past you said it might increase as you need to rediscuss those, basic agreements with Germany. Is it clear that it will increase or is there a chance it still stays low?\n\n---\n\nNo, it will increase. It depends on the tax reform freight [ph] in Switzerland. That will be the main driver. The probability to have a increases is higher than and...\n\n---\n\nAnd as we do not know what the outcome is, it's the cautious side, 18% to 20%. It doesn't have anything to do with Germany.\n\n---\n\nBut depending on that tax reform, the difference might be 4 percentage points?\n\n---\n\nNo, only 2% to 3%, or 3% to 4%, because it will increase first for other reasons on a 15% to 16% rate.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Got you. And then on the CapEx plans in Italy, even so it just the replacement, Italy as I understand is lagging, and the Southern European as a country, Southern European and whatever rebound or bottoming out. Economically speaking, I mean, I guess, your answer is no, but do you see any pickup in Italy? I mean, you're spending money, you're investing money, do you see the market bottoming? Or are you also -- do you also believe it's going to be another 2 years of difficult environment and that?\n\n---\n\nWell, the Italian plant is a European plant. We are producing in Italy for the European market specific Piping Systems. So it has nothing to do with the local Italian markets. Now we see a bottoming of the market in the residential sector in Italy but we still see a further deterioration in the non-residential. So it's why we are not very optimistic, flat residential still slowing down on non-residential.\n\n---\n\nYes. But bottoming residential is not so bad.\n\n---\n\nExcuse me?\n\n---\n\nNo, that's fine. And just on the, in front of the WELL product, a general question, I mean you stated that your visible cisterns had a negative growth rate last year. Now with your Monolith washbasin module, you obviously seem to go more and more front of the WELL, which as we all know is a change if you think 10 years back, what the Geberit was having as a strategy. At the same time, you see some decreasing visible cisterns sales. I mean, perhaps just can elaborate on that. It's like an open question, so to speak here.\n\n---\n\nSo you don't understand this chart?\n\n---\n\nI just like to see...\n\n---\n\nVisible cisterns are basically cisterns for the developing markets, Central/Eastern Europe. And with this plastic visible cistern, we are substituting ceramic visible cisterns. So it's the low part of the business. With the Monolith, our intention is to gain market share in the renovation business. Instead of renovating with traditional visible cisterns in front of the WELL, ceramic or plastic, we installed this beautiful Monolith module. It is clear that over time, maybe, the Monolith will be cannibalizing the concealed cisterns. But my philosophy is it is better we cannibalize our own business then the others do it for us. So it's too early to say. Monolith is doing extremely well, it's a combination of renovation business and new construction, and recent cannibalization, clearly, but as long as it is in our hands, fine. The visible cistern are plastic for the emerging markets. And this is declining. Declining because concealed cisterns and Monolith are gaining against these old products.\n\n---\n\nThomas [indiscernible].  I have 3 questions. You mentioned already the new plant in Italy is for Piping Systems for the European market. Can you just remind me the production side in Slovenia for which regional-end markets will that be?\n\n---\n\nSame.\n\n---\n\nSame.\n\n---\n\nSame.\n\n---\n\nEastern Europe or all the...\n\n---\n\nEastern Europe, for Europe. We have dedicated product plans for the European markets. We don't ever planned for Italy or planned for Germany. What we produce in Germany is for Europe. What we produce in Slovenia are different products, but for Europe as well.\n\n---\n\nAnd in India, it's for the local market or do you...\n\n---\n\nThis is mainly for the local markets.\n\n---\n\nSecond question, could you remind me what the currently displayed in North America is between residential and public, I think it's overstressed?\n\n---\n\n80%, 85% non-residential.\n\n---\n\nAnd last question is, when it comes to customer discounts, it has been up in 2013. Should we be aware of anything else than product mix, regional mix or scale effects or is there something structural going forward?\n\n---\n\nIt's only country-specific. I mean, market mix is we're going faster in Germany, is where we have the largest customers with the highest bonuses. So and then you have an increase on the P&L. Roman?\n\n---\n\nSo the questions from the webcast. Again, from Remo Rosenau. Looking raw material prices in relation to selling prices, is it really possible to increase your selling prices further even in a scenario where the raw material prices have rather been coming down as it was the case in full year 2013 transactions? As most, probably raw material, prices will also remain stable in 2014.\n\n---\n\nOur general annual price increase is related to inflation and has almost nothing to do with raw material price developments. Assuming the raw material prices will move up significantly this year, we will certainly have additional price increases. But this is not our scenario. We believe the raw material prices will be rather flat throughout the whole year.\n\n---\n\nAnd next question from Michael Watts from Berenberg. Will it be possible to elaborate on what defines the strategic project are likely to be undertaken by Mr. Baehny in 2015 during the transitional period? Who will take responsibility of the German business once Mr. Buhl moves to his new role?\n\n---\n\nNow, for the second question, it's too early to give any name. We will be assessing internal candidates, and we will take a decision on time to make sure that that will be a correct transition during this year in Germany. Christian Buhl will take over the CEO role as of January, there will be no transition during this year. He is busy achieving, delivering the objectives in Germany. I would be busy delivering my own objective this year, and the transition will take place early next year. And on the strategy project, this is, of course, confidential.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Then 3 questions from Tobias Loskamp from HSBC. Could you please comment if the success of AquaClean is uniform across all countries where the product is marketed or does success differ by country?\n\n---\n\nThere were some marginal differences country-by-country, but the answer is we are very satisfied in all the 11 countries where we have this initiative in place.\n\n---\n\nNext question, in the annual report, you are highlighting some shifts in the product mix for both Sanitary Systems and Piping Systems, e.g., from Mapress products made from carbon steel to copper to stainless steel. Could you elaborate if these changes are beneficial for your selling price and margin development? Are there any factors waiting on the margin?\n\n---\n\nYes, this is the market dynamics. Copper Piping Systems are losing ground. It has been losing ground, one of the key reasons being the fact that the prices have been really erratic over the years, so it was impossible for the market to ground the big project on Copper Piping Systems. The market discovered Carbon Steel Piping Systems at a lower price, with equivalent values of properties. It is why we are increasing our sales with Carbon Steel base Piping Systems, and the Copper Piping Systems is declining. So again, we are cannibalizing internally some of our systems, which is good news.\n\n---\n\nAnd the last question from Mr. Luscombe. Could you please guide on CapEx plans for the coming years?\n\n---\n\nCHF 100 million in average. Good. One question from the back.\n\n---\n\nPeter Stein [ph] from  [indiscernible] Management. You are very successful in the U.K. market beating the competition. What is it that makes you so successful there?\n\n---\n\nWell, we started there, not, 5 or 6 ago -- we started 5 or 6 ago a dedicated initiative in the U.K. And we decided to approach mainly the small installers versus the large installers. Small installers because they are easier to convince, to educate and to bring them to the Geberit brand. Secondly, we decided to have only to focus on only 2 product groups in the U.K. They are doing only installation cisterns, so mainly concealed cisterns, and they are doing only Piping Systems, metallic Piping Systems. Focus on small installers, we can influence, and also something very special in the U.K. for the concealed cisterns business, we decided also to go into the showrooms. So, which means to educate the showrooms personnel of our wholesalers to educate them, so then when end-users are coming to the showroom, they'll talk about the concealed cisterns versus the visible cisterns. So the answer in one word is high focus on the business model and on the product groups promoted commercialized in the U.K.\n\n---\n\nAnd Germany is your most important market, and you believe that you can further grow that market -- or this market will further grow in 2014. What kind of leading indicators do you have that you make feel confident with these expectations?\n\n---\n\nYou can look at many statistics, housing permits, the housing starts, the number of transactions and number of unsold houses, this is one part. We have another statistic, and we believe this is the best. You just talk to your promise, and you ask one question. Your order book is filled for how long? 1 week? 2 weeks? 3 months? 4 months? And today, the answer, if you talk to the largest and the best plumbing companies, I will say, I am booked for the next 3 to 4 months. And when you -- this kind of answer, you don't need -- you don't have any bets in that SAP the market is solid and robust, and it will continue throughout the year.\n\n---\n\nChristian Korth from MainFirst. Just have 2 questions. Within the P&L, you have in the financial -- in the P&L, in the financial results you have this small item FOREX losses; and you described in the annual report this is due to accounts receivables, I understand, from emerging markets. Could you please elaborate a little bit whether it's coming from, if it's India, if it's China, if it's, I don't know, North Africa? And the second question relating to this is how much of the total of CHF 150 million that you still have is trade receivables outstanding is in these markets?\n\n---\n\nI give you the answer, but just one word. In China, for example, our business in China is cash in advance. So there were no receivable problems. Roland, will you...\n\n---\n\nAnd the currency loss is due to intercompany receivable positions which has to be revalued when the currency is moving because you're selling basically each article once internally from a plant to a distribution company. And the risk is carried by the European companies and not by the emerging market companies. That is the source for that CHF 4 million we have in the financial results. Largely that.\n\n---\n\nMore questions? It's not the case, so thank you for having joined us to this conference here. Wish you a good today, and would could share something to eat and to drink together. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Michael Roost (Analysts)】\nMichael Roost from Bank am Bellevue. I just have 3 questions, if possible. The first one is on the AquaClean. If I remember correctly, you're not planning to launch it in any new countries in 2014. Or has that changed at all now that the production delays are, let's say, a thing of the past? Second question is on your thoughts, just generally, on the South America. What are your thoughts going forward? And then my third question is on the tax rate. Just if you could give us a bit of an idea for 2014 and then also for the development over the next couple of years, has anything changed in terms of the agreement with Germany? If you could give me an idea there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nI'll start at the end. The tax rate for this year should be around 14%, with 15% for the next 2 years in your spreadsheets. And after that, around 18% to 20%. On South America the picture is very clear. It doesn't make sense to try to penetrate this region without any acquisition. The entry buyers are very high. There are few very strong players that are local Geberits, there are very complex tax structure, so without acquisition, no presence of Geberit in this part of the world. And you will certainly ask the question, are we negotiating an acquisition? We are not negotiating, discussing any acquisition currently in South America. Regarding AquaClean, now, we stick to our decision of last year. This year it's a consolidation year. We -- in a few years, we introduce AquaClean in 11 European markets. From time-to-time you need to consolidate to slowdown and this is what we will be doing this year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christian Arnold (Analysts)】\nChristian Arnold, Bank Vontobel. I have also 2 or 3 question. And the first one, on the price effect on Slide 28, you showed the net price effect of 1.7% on the EBIT level. Could you give us the price effect that you had with your products? So how much could you increase the prices on average? And a follow-up question on the same subject, did you also increased prices in Switzerland for the first time since some years? That's one question. The other question, I would have is on systems and mechanisms. Here, we have seen a growth of 2%, roughly. In the past, these product lines always outperformed on the back of shower toilets and other products. As we don't have a limitation on capacities, again, is it a fair assumption to assume that then this product line will again outperform going forward? And then the last question I would have is on the production sites, the new production in Slovenia, I believe, does it have some ramp-up costs this year? And if so, could you quantify that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nThere will be no ramp-up costs, specific ramp-up costs this year in Slovenia. So we will be starting the third quarter and it will be, I would say, on an arrogant way, maybe as usual by Geberit, very small. So we have not planned any specific costs plans for this ramp-up of the plant. Regarding your second question, this product line, in this product line you have the AquaClean business. The last few years, we were able to grow the AquaClean business by around 20% annually. Because of supplies, major difficulty this year, we could not generate this 20% growth rates with AquaClean, it was single-digit growth rates. So that impacted basically the momentum of the growth of this product line. And in this product line, you also have the visible cisterns, and the visible cisterns are on a downward trend with negative growth rates. So this is the combined effect, negative growth rates was visible cisterns and the single-digit growth rates only for AquaClean because of supply problems. The price increase last year was around 1.5%, 1.8%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Martin Huesler (Analysts)】\nMartin Hüsler, Zurcher Kantonalbank. My question relates to your long-term margin targets. You showed this very impressive track record, and you exceeded the 23% of 25% margin range in 7 out of the last 8 years. I was just wondering what would make you change this range to a higher target or what are your thoughts there? Why do you still stick to this long-term range when you can overachieve it? And, especially for 2014, when we start -- if I look at your forecasts quality-wise, as you gave it, where is the biggest risk that margin could be lower in 2014 than it was in 2013?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nThis is an indirect very smart question. A bit of history. In 2009, together with Monolith, we were on our way to move up this margin corridor. We did not do it because of the crisis in the building industry. So since then, we are in a very difficult business environment. Just a few numbers, you don't realize it. In Spain, the building volume, the construction volume today is maximum 10% of what it was in 2008 and '07. If you go to Italy, the construction volume is down 50% before the pre-crisis level. If you go to the Netherlands, the construction volume is down 26%, 30% versus the pre-crisis level. So we will be prepared and willing to review this corridor under only one condition, simply better market environment. The construction volume in Europe is at least 30% below what it was before the crisis. So I think we've been very courageous, put it this way, that in this crisis and during this crisis to maintain this corridor and this corridor was basically a pre-crisis corridor. So as long as we are facing this weak building industry in Europe, we will not take the risk, to be honest, to change this corridor and then go to back, go to explain why we've been disappointing you. Wait and see. Now you, of course, you are asking a question about the potential margin in 2014 versus 2013. You know our style. We communicate the first guidance or guidances with each one, not before. So I will stick to this Geberit's rule today as well. Roman?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roman Sidler (Executives)】\nThere are some questions from direct cost. So first question from Remo Rosenau, Neue Helvetische Bank. Have you or will you increase your general price level again in the tune of 1.5% across the board in full year 2014 as it was the case the last few years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nThe answer is yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roman Sidler (Executives)】\nOkay. Then second question is...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nPrice increase during Q2 and full impact in Q3.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roman Sidler (Executives)】\nSecond question as well from Remo Rosenau. Partly answered already. If I recall correctly, you stopped the introduction of AquaClean in new countries of for this year in order to achieve a stronger penetration in existing markets. Are you satisfied with these efforts? And if yes, how do you measure the rate of success, and will you start to introduce AquaClean in new countries again as of 2014? Or if not, by when will that be the case again?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nWell, basically, part of the question has been answered. This year it's a consolidation year, and next year, we will add 2 or 3 new countries to these initiatives. And we are just measuring the success of the market penetration through the growth rates. When we started the initiative, we said we want at least, in average, 20% annual growth rates in every single market, and this is basically the benchmark.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roman Sidler (Executives)】\nOkay. The third question if from Alejandra Pereda from Morgan Stanley. First question, your average cost per employee seems to have increased only 1.1%. Can you provide some color on why personnel cost inflation has been so low?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nWell, first of all, the personnel costs went up for a few reasons. First of all, we had, in average, 16 more employees this year versus previous year. Secondly, we are facing a wage inflation in some markets in particular, in Germany, of at least 3% to 4%. Then we had negative currency impact on the personnel costs and we had a special program at the EMD where we trained our top managers for 1 week and this also put some pressure on our personnel expenses. Want to add something else on that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roland Iff (Executives)】\nAnother question was more, why is it so low?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nYes. But nevertheless it increased.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roland Iff (Executives)】\nDespite increase is what you said and productivity, It slowed down significantly towards the end of the year because the increase in tariffs for Germany was only for the first 6 months. And there was 3% for 18 months decided in summer 2012 -- sorry, beginning 2012. So the second half of 2013, we didn't suffer from that impact anymore.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nCorrect.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roland Iff (Executives)】\nAnd then it was just strict cost management, vacation accruals, overtime accruals, et cetera, maybe done a little bit stricter than in the past, and we saved those on our share participation plans that I have mentioned before about CHF 1 million. That offset some of the increases and last thing was reduction in pension-related expenses due to some changes we made in the Swiss pension plans at the end of 2012.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roman Sidler (Executives)】\nOkay. Second question. Could you tell us what has been the percentage of organic growth in sales of new products versus the rest?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nJust want to say one thing. If we take the new products we introduced since 2010, then every single new product with the exception of one delivered in 2013 versus 2012, growth rate's between 15% and 20%.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roman Sidler (Executives)】\nThe next question from Aynsley Lammin from Citi. First question, do you expect to increase your market share gains in 2014 compared to 2013?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nYes. We expect in every single market to outperform the market, and if we can achieve that, then we will be gaining again, market shares, yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roman Sidler (Executives)】\nSecond question, are you happy to buy shares at the current share price and do you have any limits or criteria for what share price you are willing to buy shares back at?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nWell, I mean, this is -- I have often debated with Roland, because I often say, my goodness, it's too expensive. Why are we doing this share buyback? When you look back, we did extremely well. I mean, every time we bought, and the share price went up afterward -- went up afterwards.

So we will do it anyway.  We are not speculators. We are long-term investors.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roman Sidler (Executives)】\nI would have some more questions to you, but if someone in the room would interrupt me.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nJust 2, 3 add-ons.

You mentioned already the new plant in Italy is for Piping Systems for the European market. Can you just remind me the production side in Slovenia for which regional-end markets will that be?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nSame.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nSame.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nSame.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nEastern Europe or all the...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nEastern Europe, for Europe.

I mean, market mix is we're going faster in Germany, is where we have the largest customers with the highest bonuses. So and then you have an increase on the P&L. Roman?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roman Sidler (Executives)】\nSo the questions from the webcast. Again, from Remo Rosenau. Looking raw material prices in relation to selling prices, is it really possible to increase your selling prices further even in a scenario where the raw material prices have rather been coming down as it was the case in full year 2013 transactions? As most, probably raw material, prices will also remain stable in 2014.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nOur general annual price increase is related to inflation and has almost nothing to do with raw material price developments. Assuming the raw material prices will move up significantly this year, we will certainly have additional price increases. But this is not our scenario. We believe the raw material prices will be rather flat throughout the whole year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nAnd next question from Michael Watts from Berenberg. Will it be possible to elaborate on what defines the strategic project are likely to be undertaken by Mr. Baehny in 2015 during the transitional period? Who will take responsibility of the German business once Mr. Buhl moves to his new role?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nNow, for the second question, it's too early to give any name. We will be assessing internal candidates, and we will take a decision on time to make sure that that will be a correct transition during this year in Germany. Christian Buhl will take over the CEO role as of January, there will be no transition during this year. He is busy achieving, delivering the objectives in Germany. I would be busy delivering my own objective this year, and the transition will take place early next year. And on the strategy project, this is, of course, confidential.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roman Sidler (Executives)】\nOkay. Then 3 questions from Tobias Loskamp from HSBC. Could you please comment if the success of AquaClean is uniform across all countries where the product is marketed or does success differ by country?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nThere were some marginal differences country-by-country, but the answer is we are very satisfied in all the 11 countries where we have this initiative in place.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roman Sidler (Executives)】\nNext question, in the annual report, you are highlighting some shifts in the product mix for both Sanitary Systems and Piping Systems, e.g., from Mapress products made from carbon steel to copper to stainless steel. Could you elaborate if these changes are beneficial for your selling price and margin development? Are there any factors waiting on the margin?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nYes, this is the market dynamics. Copper Piping Systems are losing ground. It has been losing ground, one of the key reasons being the fact that the prices have been really erratic over the years, so it was impossible for the market to ground the big project on Copper Piping Systems. The market discovered Carbon Steel Piping Systems at a lower price, with equivalent values of properties. It is why we are increasing our sales with Carbon Steel base Piping Systems, and the Copper Piping Systems is declining. So again, we are cannibalizing internally some of our systems, which is good news.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roman Sidler (Executives)】\nAnd the last question from Mr. Luscombe. Could you please guide on CapEx plans for the coming years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nCHF 100 million in average. Good. One question from the back.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nPeter Stein [ph] from  [indiscernible] Management. You are very successful in the U.K. market beating the competition. What is it that makes you so successful there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nWell, we started there, not, 5 or 6 ago -- we started 5 or 6 ago a dedicated initiative in the U.K. And we decided to approach mainly the small installers versus the large installers. Small installers because they are easier to convince, to educate and to bring them to the Geberit brand. Secondly, we decided to have only to focus on only 2 product groups in the U.K. They are doing only installation cisterns, so mainly concealed cisterns, and they are doing only Piping Systems, metallic Piping Systems. Focus on small installers, we can influence, and also something very special in the U.K. for the concealed cisterns business, we decided also to go into the showrooms. So, which means to educate the showrooms personnel of our wholesalers to educate them, so then when end-users are coming to the showroom, they'll talk about the concealed cisterns versus the visible cisterns. So the answer in one word is high focus on the business model and on the product groups promoted commercialized in the U.K.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nAnd Germany is your most important market, and you believe that you can further grow that market -- or this market will further grow in 2014. What kind of leading indicators do you have that you make feel confident with these expectations?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nYou can look at many statistics, housing permits, the housing starts, the number of transactions and number of unsold houses, this is one part. We have another statistic, and we believe this is the best. You just talk to your promise, and you ask one question. Your order book is filled for how long? 1 week? 2 weeks? 3 months? 4 months? And today, the answer, if you talk to the largest and the best plumbing companies, I will say, I am booked for the next 3 to 4 months. And when you -- this kind of answer, you don't need -- you don't have any bets in that SAP the market is solid and robust, and it will continue throughout the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christian Korth (Analysts)】\nChristian Korth from MainFirst. Just have 2 questions. Within the P&L, you have in the financial -- in the P&L, in the financial results you have this small item FOREX losses; and you described in the annual report this is due to accounts receivables, I understand, from emerging markets. Could you please elaborate a little bit whether it's coming from, if it's India, if it's China, if it's, I don't know, North Africa? And the second question relating to this is how much of the total of CHF 150 million that you still have is trade receivables outstanding is in these markets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nI give you the answer, but just one word. In China, for example, our business in China is cash in advance. So there were no receivable problems. Roland, will you...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roland Iff (Executives)】\nAnd the currency loss is due to intercompany receivable positions which has to be revalued when the currency is moving because you're selling basically each article once internally from a plant to a distribution company. And the risk is carried by the European companies and not by the emerging market companies. That is the source for that CHF 4 million we have in the financial results. Largely that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Albert Baehny (Executives)】\nMore questions? It's not the case, so thank you for having joined us to this conference here. Wish you a good today, and would could share something to eat and to drink together. Thank you.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; and David Tehle, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks, and then we will open up the call for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under Investor Information, Press Releases. \r\nLet me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, predictions and other nonhistorical matters, such as our 2014 forecasted financial results and capital expenditures; our planned fiscal 2014 operating, merchandising and store growth initiatives; our share repurchase expectations; and statements regarding future consumer economic trends. Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those reflected in or implied by our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning; our 2012 10-K, which was filed on March 25, 2013; our 2013 first, second and third quarter 10-Qs; and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents. \r\nYou should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call. \r\nWe will also reference certain financial measures not derived in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this morning's earnings release which, as I mentioned, is posted on dollargeneral.com. \r\nNow it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Mary Winn, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Today, we reported results for the fourth quarter 2013 and the full year. 2013 had many successes for Dollar General, representing our 24th consecutive year of same-store sales growth. \r\nAs you've heard from other retailers, the fourth quarter was a challenging time for our industry. While our sales results fell short of our expectations, we did successfully manage the business to deliver better-than-anticipated gross margin, SG&A expense control and inventory growth in line with sales growth. We also delivered earnings per share at the midpoint of our guidance range. Overall, the 3 most important factors impacting our sales in the quarter were: one, the severe winter weather that the country experienced from Thanksgiving through January; two, aggressive competitive promotions that were -- we selectively did not participate in; and three, a pullback in our core customer spending due to a number of factors, including reduced government assistance. \r\nTurning first to the weather. Across all of retail, much has been said about the weather in the fourth quarter. We experienced persistently adverse weather during the quarter that was far greater than normal. As a result, we experienced significantly reduced selling hours, driven by a combination of stores that were closed due to the inclement weather and stores that operated on reduced hours. There is no doubt the winter weather negatively impacted us across the country. When our core markets, like the Midsouth and the Southeast, get hit by severe winter storms, the communities are simply not well equipped to handle the snow and ice, and it takes a while for these markets to return to normal. As you can imagine, our distribution network was also significantly disrupted in terms of inbound, as well as outbound, freight movement. \r\nJanuary is typically a strong period for us as customers restock on the basics. Unfortunately, the last 2 weeks of January were the most severely impacted by extreme weather across a significant portion of our markets. To sum up the weather impact, we estimate that in December, 1,000 store selling days were impacted by weather, and we estimate that 7,000 selling days were impacted in January. Another way to look at this is that 34 out of the 91 days in the quarter had a negative impact from the weather. \r\nSecond, competition was and continues to be aggressive, not only in share of voice but also on the key items being advertised and the promotional pricing of these items. Promotional activity was particularly heightened during the critical selling days going into Christmas, and pricing was aggressive across all channels of retail during the fourth quarter. While we made a conscious decision to selectively participate in this arena, overall, we stayed true to our everyday low price strategy, which our customers trust and have come to depend on from us. \r\nFinally, our core customer doesn't feel she is out of the woods yet economically and continues to be cautious with her spending. All in, the record ice and snow across many of our key markets, the shortened and more promotional holiday season and the continued economic uncertainties for our core customer presented significant and greater-than-anticipated headwinds in the fourth quarter. \r\nIn our third quarter earnings call in early December, we shared with you our expectation that we would be chasing the calendar during the fourth quarter due to the loss of 6 selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. With the added impact of the weather, we simply were not able to close that gap in spite of cycling our easiest comps of 2012. As you most likely have personally experienced, some of the weather issues have continued into fiscal 2014. Our sales trends, starting out so far in the first quarter, have been impacted by the continued weather volatility. But I am pleased to report that on days when mother nature is more cooperative, we are very happy with our sales performance. \r\nIn spite of the quarter 4 headwinds, we remain focused on the long-term growth and health of the company and believe that we have plans in place for 2014 to control what we can control. We continue to increase our overall market share of consumables in both units and dollars across all markets over the 4-week, 12-week, 24-week and 52-week periods ending February 15 according to latest available Nielsen data. We still were able to increase both our customer traffic and average ticket for the 24th consecutive quarter, although at a slower rate. We also leveraged our SG&A expenses and generated significant cash flow from operations with an increase of more than 7%. During the fourth quarter, we've returned $200 million to shareholders through the repurchase of our common stock for a full year total of $620 million or 11 million shares. \r\nDavid is going to talk about the details, but I'd like to share the highlights of the year and our fourth quarter. Full year sales increased 9.2% to a record $17.5 billion, and sales per square foot increased to $220 compared to $216 a year ago. Same-store sales were up 3.3% for the year and 1.3% in the fourth quarter. Both average ticket and customer traffic were positive for the year and for the quarter. \r\nFor the year, our gross margin rate decreased 69 basis points, and we leveraged SG&A, excluding certain discrete items detailed in our press release, by 31 basis points. For the quarter, our gross margin rate decreased by 58 basis points, which was somewhat better than we expected. While there are always puts and takes on our margin performance, net-net, tobacco was the largest negative impact, and we leveraged SG&A expense by 14 basis points. \r\nOn the bottom line, net income in the fourth quarter increased 1.5%, with earnings per share up 4% over last year's fourth quarter. And for the year, our adjusted net income increased 6.5% to $1.04 billion and adjusted earnings per share increased 10% to $3.20. \r\nLooking back, we accomplished a great deal in 2013. We hit our upwardly revised target of opening 650 new stores and exceeded our combined remodel and relocation target with 582 stores, increasing our selling square footage by 6.6%. In the fourth quarter, we opened our 12th distribution center in Bethel, Pennsylvania to help us serve our growing store base in the Northeast. \r\nOn the merchandising front, we continue to innovate and maximize the sales productivity of our stores. The biggest change to our merchandising mix in 2013 was the addition of tobacco products. We completed this effort in the second quarter, and tobacco sales are continuing to have a positive impact on our sales and store traffic. A key metric is the attachment rate, and we are continuing to see this grow as 68% of our tobacco transactions include one or more additional items. In fact, 41% of tobacco transactions now include 3 or more items.  In the first half of the year, we expanded coolers in over 1,600 stores, bringing our chain average to about 12 cooler doors per store. Perishables have delivered strong growth over the course of the year. \r\nAs part of our ongoing effort to maximize store productivity, we completed our Phase 5 optimization in 3,000 stores in the first half of 2013 and reallocated square footage from hanging apparel in 4,000 stores to health and beauty aids, with a focus on high-margin private brands in the third quarter. Most of these changes were in our older legacy stores, where we continue to see opportunities for growth. \r\nLooking at gross margin overall, we're very pleased with how the year progressed. Although I'm disappointed with our shrink performance for the year, we remain optimistic that the changes we implemented in 2013 will have a greater impact this year. For example, we installed defensive fixtures in about 2,600 of our higher-risk stores in the first half of the year, and we began the process of eliminating some of the less productive, higher cost items, mainly in health and beauty, later in the year. I think this is an area where we may have been both -- we may have both overestimated our customers' willingness to purchase these higher-ticket items and underestimated the risk of shrinkage. Our SKU rationalization efforts to adjust this are well underway, with more than 300 SKUs eliminated in 2013 and an additional 300 identified or already eliminated in 2014 to ensure that we meet our customers' needs while also reducing our shrink risk. \r\nFrom an expense reduction standpoint, we continue to benefit from the capabilities of our workforce management system. This system provides our store managers with a tool to assist them as they prioritize and manage work, allowing them to be more effective in how they manage their staff in their stores. Several work elimination initiatives were introduced in 2013 to help reduce or streamline the work in our stores. Improving efficiencies in our store has been and will continue to be a significant priority for Dollar General. This is a cross-functional initiative to remove non-value-added work and reinvesting in activities that allow our store managers and their teams to better serve our customers. For instance, we are now sorting our rolltainers by planograms to eliminate re-sorting and reduce the number of steps and rolltainer moves required to stock a shelf. We've also established a new stocking program that incorporates both training and productivity tracking.\r\nWe made further inroads with regard to hiring and developing employees. In 2013, over 60% of our management positions were filled by internal candidates. This represents continued strong improvement during the past 2 years as we've made this a high priority. As Dollar General grows, we want our employees to have the opportunity to build their careers and grow both personally and professionally with the company. \r\nWe are constantly striving to fill the needs and meet the changing demands of our customers. What we saw in 2013 was that our customer needed us more than ever. With much of the economy -- excuse me, while much of the economy seems to have improved, many of our core customers are continuing to struggle, giving the well-publicized headwinds, such as reduced government benefits, continued high unemployment and underemployment, higher taxes, uncertainty around the health care costs and a reduction in unemployment benefits, just to name a few. \r\nSo we are executing on our detailed plans for 2014. I think it's fair to say that we plan to reach to our -- reach out to our customer and fill her everyday needs for basic consumable merchandise. Whether we are her first stop or a regular fill-in shop, we know that having the items our customer is depending on at price points that meet her budget requirements is crucial to our success and hers. Of course, we're always looking for new items and new categories that make her life easier, so you will see some of those in 2014 as well. \r\nTop initiatives supporting our 4 operating priorities in 2014 include the following: leveraging category management; eliminating work that is non-value-added in the retail stores; continuing our mining for cost reduction program with a target of over $50 million, which allows us the ability to reinvest in the business, offset other costs or drive our profitability; the testing of a life cycle remodel program to build our brand positioning in the marketplace; continuing our focus on reducing shrink; and finally, enhancing our customer service program. We talked about our new sites, location, technology and our 2014 store growth plans in last quarter's call. We plan to open 700 new stores in 2014, and we are confident that we have substantial opportunities for store growth in both new and existing states for many years to come as our new model estimates 14,000 current opportunities for the small box value retail sector in the United States. \r\nWe're very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2014, and our 2014 pipeline is full. We are excited about our plans, and I'm confident that we can meet our operating goals. We continue to be cautious regarding the economic outlook for our core customers, but we will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they have come to expect from Dollar General. \r\nNow David will share a more detailed review of our fourth quarter financial performance and our 2014 guidance.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As Rick has reviewed the highlights of our performance, let me now take you through some of the financial details. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 31.9% of sales, a decrease of 58 basis points from last year's fourth quarter and somewhat better than our updated 2013 guidance. Sales growth of tobacco products and perishables, both of which have lower gross margins, outpaced our other categories across both consumables and non-consumables. As expected, our shrink rate increased. These margin pressures were partially offset by a favorable LIFO credit and a favorable impact of net purchase costs. \r\nTotal SG&A improved by 14 basis points in the fourth quarter. As a company, we did not meet the financial performance threshold for our annual team share incentive compensation. However, we made the decision to provide a modest discretionary bonus to employees, excluding officers, who are eligible for our team share bonus plan. This reduction in incentive compensation contributed 45 basis points to SG&A leverage in the fourth quarter. Primarily as a result of our sales performance, we delevered most of our other operating expenses. Consistent with our performance throughout the year, bright spots included favorable results in workers' comp and general liability, as well as employee benefits. \r\nInterest expense was $22 million for the fourth quarter, a reduction of $5 million from last year's fourth quarter, primarily due to our debt refinancing. Our tax rate for the quarter was 37.5% compared to 35.9% in the 2012 quarter. The prior year quarter included a $6.5 million or a $0.02 per share benefit related to the first 3 quarters of 2012 for the retroactive reinstatement of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. \r\nTurning to our cash flow. We generated more than $1.2 billion of cash from operating activities for the year, an increase of over 7% year-over-year. Total capital expenditures were $538 million, including $124 million for new leased stores; $76 million for stores purchased or built by us; $112 million for distribution centers; $187 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; and $28 million for information system upgrades and technology-related projects. \r\nAs of the end of the year, total inventories at cost were $2.6 billion, up 6.5% in total and up less than 1% on a per-store basis. As we had planned, we were successful in getting our inventory growth in line with our sales growth as we moved through the year. \r\nRegarding our share repurchase program, we repurchased an additional $200 million of our common stock in the fourth quarter. For the 2013 fiscal year, we repurchased $620 million or 11 million shares. So far in 2014, we have repurchased an additional 3.5 million shares or $200 million using the majority of the cash proceeds from the closing of our sale-leaseback transaction, leaving us with a remaining authorization of approximately $824 million. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we've repurchased 33.8 million shares, with a total return of cash to shareholders of $1.7 billion. We plan to remain consistent, as well as opportunistic, in share repurchases going forward. \r\nNow for an overview of our guidance for 2014. We expect top line sales for 2014 to increase 8% to 9%. Overall square footage is expected to grow 6% to 7%, and same-store sales are expected to increase 3% to 4%. \r\nWith regard to expenses, we have significant headwinds in SG&A that will result in us delevering SG&A in 2014. The most significant is the planned increase in our cash incentive compensation year-over-year. In recent years, we have met or exceeded the threshold for our team share annual cash incentive plan, making 2013 an anomaly. Based on our budgeting process, bonus targets have been established for 2014, and our quarterly accrual will be based on our outlook as we move through the year. \r\nCompared to 2013, this impact is estimated to be about $35 million or $0.07 per share and an 18-basis-point headwind to SG&A. Also we're facing increased costs in SG&A due to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. While we have made progress in minimizing the impact, this will likely be a headwind of about $10 million to $15 million or $0.02 to $0.03 per share and 5 to 8 basis points headwind to SG&A. \r\nAs a result of our sale-leaseback transaction that closed in late January, we will be facing a modest increase in SG&A of approximately 5 basis points. The sale-leaseback will have a negative impact to both operating profit and net income. However, this project is accretive to earnings per share as we have already used the majority of the proceeds to repurchase shares. In total, these 3 SG&A expense items will likely negatively impact us by $55 million to $60 million or 28 to 30 points of SG&A deleverage in total. \r\nThe anticipated earnings per share impact is about $0.09 to $0.10 for the combined incentive comp and ACA headwinds. Post-2014, we would not expect year-over-year increases of this magnitude, but rather that these costs would be normalized into our operating performance going forward. We do expect that health care costs will continue to be subject to increases depending on enrollment and our claims experience. \r\nAdjusted operating profit is forecasted to be in the range of 2% to 5% -- profit growth is forecasted to be in the range of 2% to 5%. The anticipated SG&A headwinds are impacting this growth rate by approximately 3 percentage points. We are forecasting net interest expense for the year to be in the range of $85 million to $90 million. We're committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating while managing to a leverage ratio of 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA. At the same time, if circumstances in the debt and equity markets are such that we deem it prudent to temporarily increase or decrease our debt levels, we may do so. \r\nWe expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 38%. We expect diluted earnings per share for the year to be $3.45 to $3.55. It's a growth rate of 8% to 11% on an adjusted basis over the $3.20 in 2013. Please keep in mind, the anticipated combined impact of incentive compensation and the Affordable Care Act is approximately $45 million to $50 million or $0.09 to $0.10 per share. This is about 3 percentage points of growth on our adjusted earnings per share. \r\nWe're assuming in the range of 306 million to 307 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year, which assumes the anticipated repurchase of approximately $1.1 billion of our common stock, including what we have already completed in the first quarter. In total, this repurchase activity represents approximately 5% of our current market capitalization. 2014 capital expenditures are forecasted to be in the range of $450 million to $500 million. \r\nSpecifically for the fiscal first quarter, we are forecasting a total increase in sales of 7% to 8%, same-store sales growth of 2% to 3% and adjusted earnings per share of $0.72 to $0.74. There are several factors that are weighing on our first quarter result. As we mentioned, the adverse weather impacting sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 has continued into the first quarter this year. Gross margins will continue to be impacted by our tobacco introduction as this product category was not fully launched until the second quarter of 2013.  On a quarterly basis, the anticipated impact of the incentive compensation and ACA on earnings per share is weighted to the second half of the year due to timing year-over-year. As you build your quarterly models, for the remainder of the year, please keep in mind that we will still be facing the negative gross margin rate impact of the 2013 introduction of tobacco in Q1 and Q2. \r\nAs has been the trend for the last several years, we believe our customers' discretionary spending will continue to be constrained in 2014. As our long-term track record demonstrates, Dollar General is well positioned to serve our customers regardless of how the economy plays out. \r\nNow I'd like to turn the call back over to Rick.\n\n---\n\nThanks, David. Dollar General is a strong and growing business with tremendous high-return store growth opportunities that we intend to capture. Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value are unchanged. We have a business model that generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in store growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases. \r\nMy sincere appreciation goes out to more than 100,000 Dollar General employees for all they do to fulfill our mission of serving others in the more than 1.5 billion annual customer transactions. With that, Mary Winn, we'd now like to open it up for questions.\n\n---\n\nAll right. Operator, we'll take our first question, please.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Mary Winn Pilkington (Executives)】\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; and David Tehle, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks, and then we will open up the call for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under Investor Information, Press Releases. \r\nLet me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, predictions and other nonhistorical matters, such as our 2014 forecasted financial results and capital expenditures; our planned fiscal 2014 operating, merchandising and store growth initiatives; our share repurchase expectations; and statements regarding future consumer economic trends. Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those reflected in or implied by our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning; our 2012 10-K, which was filed on March 25, 2013; our 2013 first, second and third quarter 10-Qs; and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents. \r\nYou should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call. \r\nWe will also reference certain financial measures not derived in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this morning's earnings release which, as I mentioned, is posted on dollargeneral.com. \r\nNow it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nThank you, Mary Winn, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Today, we reported results for the fourth quarter 2013 and the full year. 2013 had many successes for Dollar General, representing our 24th consecutive year of same-store sales growth. \r\nAs you've heard from other retailers, the fourth quarter was a challenging time for our industry. While our sales results fell short of our expectations, we did successfully manage the business to deliver better-than-anticipated gross margin, SG&A expense control and inventory growth in line with sales growth. We also delivered earnings per share at the midpoint of our guidance range. Overall, the 3 most important factors impacting our sales in the quarter were: one, the severe winter weather that the country experienced from Thanksgiving through January; two, aggressive competitive promotions that were -- we selectively did not participate in; and three, a pullback in our core customer spending due to a number of factors, including reduced government assistance. \r\nTurning first to the weather. Across all of retail, much has been said about the weather in the fourth quarter. We experienced persistently adverse weather during the quarter that was far greater than normal. As a result, we experienced significantly reduced selling hours, driven by a combination of stores that were closed due to the inclement weather and stores that operated on reduced hours. There is no doubt the winter weather negatively impacted us across the country. When our core markets, like the Midsouth and the Southeast, get hit by severe winter storms, the communities are simply not well equipped to handle the snow and ice, and it takes a while for these markets to return to normal. As you can imagine, our distribution network was also significantly disrupted in terms of inbound, as well as outbound, freight movement. \r\nJanuary is typically a strong period for us as customers restock on the basics. Unfortunately, the last 2 weeks of January were the most severely impacted by extreme weather across a significant portion of our markets. To sum up the weather impact, we estimate that in December, 1,000 store selling days were impacted by weather, and we estimate that 7,000 selling days were impacted in January. Another way to look at this is that 34 out of the 91 days in the quarter had a negative impact from the weather. \r\nSecond, competition was and continues to be aggressive, not only in share of voice but also on the key items being advertised and the promotional pricing of these items. Promotional activity was particularly heightened during the critical selling days going into Christmas, and pricing was aggressive across all channels of retail during the fourth quarter. While we made a conscious decision to selectively participate in this arena, overall, we stayed true to our everyday low price strategy, which our customers trust and have come to depend on from us. \r\nFinally, our core customer doesn't feel she is out of the woods yet economically and continues to be cautious with her spending. All in, the record ice and snow across many of our key markets, the shortened and more promotional holiday season and the continued economic uncertainties for our core customer presented significant and greater-than-anticipated headwinds in the fourth quarter. \r\nIn our third quarter earnings call in early December, we shared with you our expectation that we would be chasing the calendar during the fourth quarter due to the loss of 6 selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. With the added impact of the weather, we simply were not able to close that gap in spite of cycling our easiest comps of 2012. As you most likely have personally experienced, some of the weather issues have continued into fiscal 2014. Our sales trends, starting out so far in the first quarter, have been impacted by the continued weather volatility. But I am pleased to report that on days when mother nature is more cooperative, we are very happy with our sales performance. \r\nIn spite of the quarter 4 headwinds, we remain focused on the long-term growth and health of the company and believe that we have plans in place for 2014 to control what we can control. We continue to increase our overall market share of consumables in both units and dollars across all markets over the 4-week, 12-week, 24-week and 52-week periods ending February 15 according to latest available Nielsen data. We still were able to increase both our customer traffic and average ticket for the 24th consecutive quarter, although at a slower rate. We also leveraged our SG&A expenses and generated significant cash flow from operations with an increase of more than 7%. During the fourth quarter, we've returned $200 million to shareholders through the repurchase of our common stock for a full year total of $620 million or 11 million shares. \r\nDavid is going to talk about the details, but I'd like to share the highlights of the year and our fourth quarter. Full year sales increased 9.2% to a record $17.5 billion, and sales per square foot increased to $220 compared to $216 a year ago. Same-store sales were up 3.3% for the year and 1.3% in the fourth quarter. Both average ticket and customer traffic were positive for the year and for the quarter. \r\nFor the year, our gross margin rate decreased 69 basis points, and we leveraged SG&A, excluding certain discrete items detailed in our press release, by 31 basis points. For the quarter, our gross margin rate decreased by 58 basis points, which was somewhat better than we expected. While there are always puts and takes on our margin performance, net-net, tobacco was the largest negative impact, and we leveraged SG&A expense by 14 basis points. \r\nOn the bottom line, net income in the fourth quarter increased 1.5%, with earnings per share up 4% over last year's fourth quarter. And for the year, our adjusted net income increased 6.5% to $1.04 billion and adjusted earnings per share increased 10% to $3.20. \r\nLooking back, we accomplished a great deal in 2013. We hit our upwardly revised target of opening 650 new stores and exceeded our combined remodel and relocation target with 582 stores, increasing our selling square footage by 6.6%. In the fourth quarter, we opened our 12th distribution center in Bethel, Pennsylvania to help us serve our growing store base in the Northeast. \r\nOn the merchandising front, we continue to innovate and maximize the sales productivity of our stores. The biggest change to our merchandising mix in 2013 was the addition of tobacco products. We completed this effort in the second quarter, and tobacco sales are continuing to have a positive impact on our sales and store traffic. A key metric is the attachment rate, and we are continuing to see this grow as 68% of our tobacco transactions include one or more additional items. In fact, 41% of tobacco transactions now include 3 or more items.  In the first half of the year, we expanded coolers in over 1,600 stores, bringing our chain average to about 12 cooler doors per store. Perishables have delivered strong growth over the course of the year. \r\nAs part of our ongoing effort to maximize store productivity, we completed our Phase 5 optimization in 3,000 stores in the first half of 2013 and reallocated square footage from hanging apparel in 4,000 stores to health and beauty aids, with a focus on high-margin private brands in the third quarter. Most of these changes were in our older legacy stores, where we continue to see opportunities for growth. \r\nLooking at gross margin overall, we're very pleased with how the year progressed. Although I'm disappointed with our shrink performance for the year, we remain optimistic that the changes we implemented in 2013 will have a greater impact this year. For example, we installed defensive fixtures in about 2,600 of our higher-risk stores in the first half of the year, and we began the process of eliminating some of the less productive, higher cost items, mainly in health and beauty, later in the year. I think this is an area where we may have been both -- we may have both overestimated our customers' willingness to purchase these higher-ticket items and underestimated the risk of shrinkage. Our SKU rationalization efforts to adjust this are well underway, with more than 300 SKUs eliminated in 2013 and an additional 300 identified or already eliminated in 2014 to ensure that we meet our customers' needs while also reducing our shrink risk. \r\nFrom an expense reduction standpoint, we continue to benefit from the capabilities of our workforce management system. This system provides our store managers with a tool to assist them as they prioritize and manage work, allowing them to be more effective in how they manage their staff in their stores. Several work elimination initiatives were introduced in 2013 to help reduce or streamline the work in our stores. Improving efficiencies in our store has been and will continue to be a significant priority for Dollar General. This is a cross-functional initiative to remove non-value-added work and reinvesting in activities that allow our store managers and their teams to better serve our customers. For instance, we are now sorting our rolltainers by planograms to eliminate re-sorting and reduce the number of steps and rolltainer moves required to stock a shelf. We've also established a new stocking program that incorporates both training and productivity tracking.\r\nWe made further inroads with regard to hiring and developing employees. In 2013, over 60% of our management positions were filled by internal candidates. This represents continued strong improvement during the past 2 years as we've made this a high priority. As Dollar General grows, we want our employees to have the opportunity to build their careers and grow both personally and professionally with the company. \r\nWe are constantly striving to fill the needs and meet the changing demands of our customers. What we saw in 2013 was that our customer needed us more than ever. With much of the economy -- excuse me, while much of the economy seems to have improved, many of our core customers are continuing to struggle, giving the well-publicized headwinds, such as reduced government benefits, continued high unemployment and underemployment, higher taxes, uncertainty around the health care costs and a reduction in unemployment benefits, just to name a few. \r\nSo we are executing on our detailed plans for 2014. I think it's fair to say that we plan to reach to our -- reach out to our customer and fill her everyday needs for basic consumable merchandise. Whether we are her first stop or a regular fill-in shop, we know that having the items our customer is depending on at price points that meet her budget requirements is crucial to our success and hers. Of course, we're always looking for new items and new categories that make her life easier, so you will see some of those in 2014 as well. \r\nTop initiatives supporting our 4 operating priorities in 2014 include the following: leveraging category management; eliminating work that is non-value-added in the retail stores; continuing our mining for cost reduction program with a target of over $50 million, which allows us the ability to reinvest in the business, offset other costs or drive our profitability; the testing of a life cycle remodel program to build our brand positioning in the marketplace; continuing our focus on reducing shrink; and finally, enhancing our customer service program. We talked about our new sites, location, technology and our 2014 store growth plans in last quarter's call. We plan to open 700 new stores in 2014, and we are confident that we have substantial opportunities for store growth in both new and existing states for many years to come as our new model estimates 14,000 current opportunities for the small box value retail sector in the United States. \r\nWe're very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2014, and our 2014 pipeline is full. We are excited about our plans, and I'm confident that we can meet our operating goals. We continue to be cautious regarding the economic outlook for our core customers, but we will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they have come to expect from Dollar General. \r\nNow David will share a more detailed review of our fourth quarter financial performance and our 2014 guidance.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: David Tehle (Executives)】\nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As Rick has reviewed the highlights of our performance, let me now take you through some of the financial details. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 31.9% of sales, a decrease of 58 basis points from last year's fourth quarter and somewhat better than our updated 2013 guidance. Sales growth of tobacco products and perishables, both of which have lower gross margins, outpaced our other categories across both consumables and non-consumables. As expected, our shrink rate increased. These margin pressures were partially offset by a favorable LIFO credit and a favorable impact of net purchase costs. \r\nTotal SG&A improved by 14 basis points in the fourth quarter. As a company, we did not meet the financial performance threshold for our annual team share incentive compensation. However, we made the decision to provide a modest discretionary bonus to employees, excluding officers, who are eligible for our team share bonus plan. This reduction in incentive compensation contributed 45 basis points to SG&A leverage in the fourth quarter. Primarily as a result of our sales performance, we delevered most of our other operating expenses. Consistent with our performance throughout the year, bright spots included favorable results in workers' comp and general liability, as well as employee benefits. \r\nInterest expense was $22 million for the fourth quarter, a reduction of $5 million from last year's fourth quarter, primarily due to our debt refinancing. Our tax rate for the quarter was 37.5% compared to 35.9% in the 2012 quarter. The prior year quarter included a $6.5 million or a $0.02 per share benefit related to the first 3 quarters of 2012 for the retroactive reinstatement of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. \r\nTurning to our cash flow. We generated more than $1.2 billion of cash from operating activities for the year, an increase of over 7% year-over-year. Total capital expenditures were $538 million, including $124 million for new leased stores; $76 million for stores purchased or built by us; $112 million for distribution centers; $187 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; and $28 million for information system upgrades and technology-related projects. \r\nAs of the end of the year, total inventories at cost were $2.6 billion, up 6.5% in total and up less than 1% on a per-store basis. As we had planned, we were successful in getting our inventory growth in line with our sales growth as we moved through the year. \r\nRegarding our share repurchase program, we repurchased an additional $200 million of our common stock in the fourth quarter. For the 2013 fiscal year, we repurchased $620 million or 11 million shares. So far in 2014, we have repurchased an additional 3.5 million shares or $200 million using the majority of the cash proceeds from the closing of our sale-leaseback transaction, leaving us with a remaining authorization of approximately $824 million. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we've repurchased 33.8 million shares, with a total return of cash to shareholders of $1.7 billion. We plan to remain consistent, as well as opportunistic, in share repurchases going forward. \r\nNow for an overview of our guidance for 2014. We expect top line sales for 2014 to increase 8% to 9%. Overall square footage is expected to grow 6% to 7%, and same-store sales are expected to increase 3% to 4%. \r\nWith regard to expenses, we have significant headwinds in SG&A that will result in us delevering SG&A in 2014. The most significant is the planned increase in our cash incentive compensation year-over-year. In recent years, we have met or exceeded the threshold for our team share annual cash incentive plan, making 2013 an anomaly. Based on our budgeting process, bonus targets have been established for 2014, and our quarterly accrual will be based on our outlook as we move through the year. \r\nCompared to 2013, this impact is estimated to be about $35 million or $0.07 per share and an 18-basis-point headwind to SG&A. Also we're facing increased costs in SG&A due to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. While we have made progress in minimizing the impact, this will likely be a headwind of about $10 million to $15 million or $0.02 to $0.03 per share and 5 to 8 basis points headwind to SG&A. \r\nAs a result of our sale-leaseback transaction that closed in late January, we will be facing a modest increase in SG&A of approximately 5 basis points. The sale-leaseback will have a negative impact to both operating profit and net income. However, this project is accretive to earnings per share as we have already used the majority of the proceeds to repurchase shares. In total, these 3 SG&A expense items will likely negatively impact us by $55 million to $60 million or 28 to 30 points of SG&A deleverage in total. \r\nThe anticipated earnings per share impact is about $0.09 to $0.10 for the combined incentive comp and ACA headwinds. Post-2014, we would not expect year-over-year increases of this magnitude, but rather that these costs would be normalized into our operating performance going forward. We do expect that health care costs will continue to be subject to increases depending on enrollment and our claims experience. \r\nAdjusted operating profit is forecasted to be in the range of 2% to 5% -- profit growth is forecasted to be in the range of 2% to 5%. The anticipated SG&A headwinds are impacting this growth rate by approximately 3 percentage points. We are forecasting net interest expense for the year to be in the range of $85 million to $90 million. We're committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating while managing to a leverage ratio of 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA. At the same time, if circumstances in the debt and equity markets are such that we deem it prudent to temporarily increase or decrease our debt levels, we may do so. \r\nWe expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 38%. We expect diluted earnings per share for the year to be $3.45 to $3.55. It's a growth rate of 8% to 11% on an adjusted basis over the $3.20 in 2013. Please keep in mind, the anticipated combined impact of incentive compensation and the Affordable Care Act is approximately $45 million to $50 million or $0.09 to $0.10 per share. This is about 3 percentage points of growth on our adjusted earnings per share. \r\nWe're assuming in the range of 306 million to 307 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year, which assumes the anticipated repurchase of approximately $1.1 billion of our common stock, including what we have already completed in the first quarter. In total, this repurchase activity represents approximately 5% of our current market capitalization. 2014 capital expenditures are forecasted to be in the range of $450 million to $500 million. \r\nSpecifically for the fiscal first quarter, we are forecasting a total increase in sales of 7% to 8%, same-store sales growth of 2% to 3% and adjusted earnings per share of $0.72 to $0.74. There are several factors that are weighing on our first quarter result. As we mentioned, the adverse weather impacting sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 has continued into the first quarter this year. Gross margins will continue to be impacted by our tobacco introduction as this product category was not fully launched until the second quarter of 2013.  On a quarterly basis, the anticipated impact of the incentive compensation and ACA on earnings per share is weighted to the second half of the year due to timing year-over-year. As you build your quarterly models, for the remainder of the year, please keep in mind that we will still be facing the negative gross margin rate impact of the 2013 introduction of tobacco in Q1 and Q2. \r\nAs has been the trend for the last several years, we believe our customers' discretionary spending will continue to be constrained in 2014. As our long-term track record demonstrates, Dollar General is well positioned to serve our customers regardless of how the economy plays out. \r\nNow I'd like to turn the call back over to Rick.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nThanks, David. Dollar General is a strong and growing business with tremendous high-return store growth opportunities that we intend to capture. Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value are unchanged. We have a business model that generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in store growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases. \r\nMy sincere appreciation goes out to more than 100,000 Dollar General employees for all they do to fulfill our mission of serving others in the more than 1.5 billion annual customer transactions. With that, Mary Winn, we'd now like to open it up for questions.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mary Winn Pilkington (Executives)】\nAll right. Operator, we'll take our first question, please.",
      "transcript_text3": "Provided -- but I wanted to ask a question about operating income growth. Certainly, I understand that these factors, particularly the incentive comp, is very specific to 2014. But as we look beyond this upcoming year, I mean, do you -- are you stating that operating income growth can be back to at or better than top line growth going forward?\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, Paul, we're not giving specific guidance beyond 2014. But I did say in my prepared comments that we do think we've got some headwinds in 2014 that are -- that won't reoccur as we get out of 2014 and in 2015 and beyond. Specifically, we talked about the team share, the incentive comp being $35 million or about $0.07 a share, 18 basis points on SG&A. We talked about the Affordable Care Act. That's $10 million to $15 million or 5 to 8 basis points, $0.02 to $0.03 earnings per share. And then the sale-leaseback, although it doesn't hit earnings per share, it does hit the basis points on SG&A, and that was about $10 million. So we have some discrete items here that are impacting 2014. And again, as we get beyond 2014, we see these being more normalized and not being an impact as we get into 2015 and beyond. And again, we're just not giving specific guidance beyond 2014 at this point in time.\n\n---\n\nFair enough. And then just moving to the top line. If -- in addition to the weather, it was mentioned that there's consumer headwinds, taxes, health care, et cetera, along with some competitive headwinds with Walmart and others being promotional and also trying to open up small stores. Can you just go a little bit deeper into the top line initiatives and help us be comfortable with your ability to still comp 3% to 4% in 2014? What are you are expecting from the DG remodels? And what kind of lift are you seeing as you make these planogram changes? That would -- that color would be helpful.\n\n---\n\nYes, Paul. I'll take that one. A couple things here. First of all, our remodel, relocation and new store program continues to be as healthy as ever. Our new stores continue to open up at 85% to 90% of our average comp number. I -- fact, I looked at some real estate numbers just yesterday, reviewing the 2013 projects, and they were tracking at almost 101% of our projection, so continue to be very, very healthy. I have historically laid out on this call, all of our initiatives going forward in a lot of detail. And I've elected this year, because of the intensity of the competitive environment out there, to choose to rather come back to you and tell you how we're doing once we get them done. But I will tell you that we are focused on SKU productivity. We actually believe we can do more in 2014 with less SKUs. We've examined a lot of categories, and we have discovered there are categories we can expand and categories that we're going to contract as we move through the year. We've become highly focused on not just work simplification but work elimination in the retail stores, which will free up our store managers and district managers to be more involved in the merchandising and store standards. We are also -- which I will report on as we move through the year, have developed what we are calling out a life cycle remodel, and the majority of these stores are undersized by our current standards. They're in the 5,700 to 6,500 square feet. And these are stores that historically, we might stand up and say, \"Hey, let's relocate them,\" but they're in keeper sites now. They're in good spots. We don't have the opportunity to expand them. And we've done some experimentation of going in and working this smaller store, and it's costing us about 30% to -- 30% less to remodel them, and we're generating a return that's 25% to 40% higher. And really what this involves is going in and refreshing the store up in terms of our new decor package and then making the commitment to the right categories that are in there. Rather than trying to play in every category, really focusing on those that are most productive. And then, of course, we're going to continue to stay focused on category management. And I know, Paul, that's kind of much broader than we historically have given you, but I would rather report this year on how we're doing versus laying it out on the table upfront.\n\n---\n\nSo Peter, we missed the first part of what you were saying.\n\n---\n\nSure, I'll restart. When I look at the comp guidance for Q1 in the context of the full year guide, you're guiding 2% to 3%, so the full year guide of 3% to 4% implies some acceleration. At the same time, you're going to be lapping the tobacco rollout in the second quarter. So assuming you kind of have an easy compare in the fourth quarter, but I wanted to get some comfort around how you're thinking about the acceleration quarters 2 through 4.\n\n---\n\nYes, great question. We actually -- we're feeling very comfortable about the merchandising initiatives that are starting to roll out. We are actually getting ready to do our spring roadshow, where we could go out, Peter, and lay all those out for the store managers. We're very comfortable there. And we're also -- quite honestly, I think the competitive environment is going to settle down. And really intense competitor -- competitive environments have a habit of coming and going, and when that does happen, I believe the role of EDLP is going to be even more important than the promotional activity that we've seen recently. So -- and I also think -- I fall back to what we said in our comments, when mother nature is not interfering with what's going on, we're pleased with what we're seeing. And I know the groundhog is getting every bit they can out of seeing their shadow this year, but we think the good spring weather is coming.\n\n---\n\nYes. I just want to jump on the weather piece of it, that, in so far, in first quarter, we have continued to have a weather impact. And that plays a big role in how we set our guidance for the quarter.\n\n---\n\nOkay, very good. On the weather, certainly, you guys are going to have some disruption with closures. I was curious more on the backdrop of energy costs. Have you seen sort of an overhang in some of the cold weather-impacted markets of lower comp, as maybe the discretionary income of your customers has come down a bit?\n\n---\n\nYes. I can tell you, if I took -- it's interesting you brought this up. We took the 1,000 store -- took the bottom 1,000 stores that were in the hardest hit in regard to temperature and compared them to 1,000 stores that were in areas that weren't as severely impacted by the weather. And Peter, the significant change in the comp -- it's significant, the difference in the comp. I attribute that to 2 things: number one, the weather. I do think that we do know that natural gas and propane are both going to be up significantly for the consumer, and we might be seeing some of those higher heating bills working their way through now. So it's a little bit of both.\n\n---\n\nIt's actually Judah on for Ed. Just wanted to first follow up on just the operating margin guidance. And I think even x the items that you called out, the growth is a little lower than we expected, which seems like there may be some gross margin impact that's more than we anticipated. Can you talk a little bit more, beyond tobacco, about what's going on with the gross margin? You called out kind of the macro was hurting that a little bit also.\n\n---\n\nYes. I'll take it off, and then, please jump in, Rick. As we look at our gross margin for the year, clearly, the first half of the year is being impacted by tobacco, particularly the first quarter, but also in the second quarter. And then as we get to the back half of the year, that mitigates. And right now, we are actually forecasting that as we get into third and fourth quarter, we should start seeing some leverage in gross margin. So I don't think there's a whole lot besides the tobacco impact to talk about here. On the first -- we talked about shrink. We see shrink improving as we go through the year. And again, that will be more second half-based than first half-based. We're still dealing with that a little bit here in the first part of the year. But besides those items, I don't think there are many other items in gross margin that would have an impact.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just a follow-up. Can you talk a little bit about the comments out of Walmart that they're going to be expanding their small store rollout. It's currently not a huge number of stores, but there is focus on that Express format that maybe competes a little bit more with you guys.\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, Walmart is a fabulous competitor. There is absolutely no doubt about it. I think, though, Judah, if you look at it, their primary focus is the neighborhood store. They're talking about adding 100 Express stores, I think, this coming year, and primarily, their focus is on the neighborhood market. And we're going to open up over 700 stores. So I think we've got a significant lead here, and we'll just have to see how that one plays out.\n\n---\n\nSo as we think about your model beyond 2014, is it fair to think about a 3% comp or so, flattish gross margins and a low-single-digit leverage point as kind of a baseline? Any color you can kind of give us on how to think about the model over a multiyear basis would be really helpful.\n\n---\n\nYes. I think I'll have to go back to my earlier comment that we know we have items in 2014, the team share, the Affordable Care Act and the sale-leaseback that are having an impact, particularly on our SG&A and our operating profit [ph] if you go to the bottom line. That should be more normalized as we get outside of 2014. But again, beyond that, we're just not giving guidance over and beyond 2014 at this point in time.\n\n---\n\nMatt, I would say is what David's calling out is spot on. I would say to you that we have a long track record, though, of really good results, so I wouldn't let 2014 influence me looking forward.\n\n---\n\nRight. On the same-store sales front, the 3% to 4%, I think you -- on our math, you basically get 200 basis points just from the store opening waterfall and relocations. Just kind of trying to plug the delta between the 3% to 4% and the 2%. I guess that's some of the merchandising initiatives that you said are still to come.\n\n---\n\nThat's exactly right. We call out, historically, 1.5% to 2% on the real estate program. And then the rest is what we're going to do going through the course of the year to drive traffic and sales.\n\n---\n\nAnd then last question on the square footage front. So last call, you raised the saturation target about 40% to 14,000. Have you seen anything competitively that would relate to the availability of sites? And one thing I was wondering is would you guys consider acceleration? Is that an opportunity if a key competitor were to slow the growth for a few years here?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think the issue of accelerating our new store growth is one that David and I wrestle with all the time. We are very much into organizational capacity. And if you think about it, every year that we've been together here as a team, we've upped the number of new stores that we've opened. And what we don't want to do is get ourselves into the jam the company got itself into several years ago, where it actually had to come in and close 400 stores because in the rush to open new stores, we were more focused on quantity rather than quality. And I would rather guide open 700 stores and open them right than open 850 and be marginal. So it's something we wrestle with all the time. It's a very fair question. But right now, we're very comfortable with the number of stores we're going to open.\n\n---\n\nSo let me start with, strategically, when you look at the discretionary categories, right, which have struggled for a couple of years here, is -- how do you think about that business longer term in terms of -- I think you've cut back a little bit on apparel. But really thinking about getting a major change there in terms of space allocation, what you carry in terms of SKUs, maybe you cut back toys, categories that are hard to compete in beyond convenience, how you think about revitalizing that business? Or is it just a matter of the economy getting better?\n\n---\n\nActually, John, it's a combination of both. We've said all along that we're really comfortable with the steps we've taken in non-consumables in terms of the branding, how the products position in the stores, the quality, the fact that we've been able to improve the quality and reduce the price to the consumer, and we are going to need some help with the economy. Having said that, though, Phase 5 is the perfect example of how we're looking at everything, in that we're saying that every category has to carry its own water in the store. And if you look at the fact that we have reduced hanging apparel in some areas, we are committed to getting the store balanced properly. But saying -- having said all of that, we think the non-consumables side of the business is incredibly important. We are today's general store, and getting that offering moving, we think, is incredibly important to the overall mix and to our value [ph] proposition. So we're very committed, and we're still committed to it.\n\n---\n\nAll right. And then 2 final things. If you -- we had talked, I think, on the last call or the one before that, maybe migrating some of the learnings from DG Market into the rest of the box, particularly something like produce. Any updated thought on that? And then, secondly, how aggressive do you think you'll be in trying -- and how much of an opportunity do you think it is going after the CVS tobacco customer? Big opportunity? Do you go after that aggressively? Or is that just kind of whatever falls into your lap happens?\n\n---\n\nYes, 2 good questions. We continue to experiment with Dollar General Market. John, I grew up selling produce and meat, and it's pretty easy for me. But it's very difficult teaching somebody how to sell it when they're not used to selling it in terms of rotation, how you order it, how you mark it down, how you keep it fresh. And right now, I don't see a lot of movement like moving produce items into the traditional DG. I will tell you, Todd and his team have made some learnings on the perishables side, the cooler side, that we've been able to move into the traditional Dollar General stores, that are beneficial. In regards to the CVS thing, I think what happens when someone gives up a category like that, those sales just tend to go where they're going to go. I think we'll get our share of it, but I don't think it's going to be more than that.\n\n---\n\nI'd like to start by just talking a little bit about the gross margin. And I know there's been a bunch of questions about it, but I actually want to be a little backward-looking. And you had a very tough comparison this fourth, and clearly, shrink was a negative. The mix wasn't particularly a positive. And yet, the gross margin was much better. Can you talk about maybe what the factors were? You talked about the cost of products. But is that about global sourcing or something else?\n\n---\n\nYes. Our IMU was definitely better, and our net purchase cost, ultimately, was better in the quarter than we had in our original guidance forecast. And I think there are a whole variety of factors that go into that, Meredith. And quite honestly, it's a little hard to dissect and say exactly how much is due to what, but you're definitely hitting on it there. A piece of it would be a little better activity going on in our foreign sourcing. We continue to expand products that we're sourcing other places. We now do trash bags out of Thailand, crackers out of Colombia. We have $1 pasta out of Italy. We're doing some $1 lotions out of Mexico. It goes on and on. So we continue to be very, very, very innovative with what we're doing with our foreign sourcing. And then I think just the merchants and the buyers did a better job overall in terms of the -- how they were able to partner with the vendors and the types of deals that they were able to get for Dollar General. So I think it's a whole variety of things.\n\n---\n\nAnd I think, Meredith, I'll throw out one thing, too. I think the -- it was our feeling the environment was incredibly price competitive. And people were throwing prices during extreme weather conditions that I don't think people were going to respond to anyway because they couldn't get to the store or they'd already stocked up. And we chose not to play in that, and we focused ourselves on taking care of the inventory we had in the store.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And I guess, David, back to what you were saying. Is there any reason to believe that the sort of tailwinds you have in the gross margin aren't going to continue? You didn't use up all the opportunities you had.\n\n---\n\nWe still have a lot of opportunity in our private label, our foreign sourcing and our shrink. Again, let's not forget shrink because shrink, unfortunately, has been going the other way now for several quarters. So again, we continue to work those areas. And I think the question we have, Meredith, and we've talked about this before, is how much of that do we invest in price, staying true to EDLP, driving units to the box and growing margin versus letting fall to the bottom line because we've said publicly several times that the most important thing for us is making sure we are the EDLP operator and that we continue to grow our market share. So we'll have decisions to make on those private label, sourcing, et cetera, the pluses we get there, how much of that do we let fall through and how much of it do we invest in price.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then I've got another question. You actually said something that surprised me a little bit about changes being made with the rolltainers and how -- stuff that goes in them. And I was under the impression that the rolltainers  were already sorted by aisle, and that was the whole point of having rolltainers. Is that not true?\n\n---\n\nThat is 100% true, but we've taken and refined it even further, where the product actually comes out how it's laid out on the shelf. So imagine all the detergent used to show up for the detergent aisle, and now we're trying to lay the rolltainer out where it actually matches to the shelf by the planogram.\n\n---\n\nWow, that's great. And then I just have one other quick question. You did a sale-leaseback, and I believe that you have been buying -- you're doing fee development for a while now. Is there significantly more owned real estate that you would consider monetizing? And presumably, if you did -- not that you have a cash flow shortage, but that you would also use that to buy back stock?\n\n---\n\nThere are other opportunities in our real estate area to do that if we wanted to. We don't have any plans right now to capitalize on that at this point in time. So I would say just stay tuned, and it may be something that we'll do in the future as we evaluate doing incremental share buybacks. I do want to stress, when we do something like that, and we demonstrated this with what we did when we closed the deal in January, the main reason for doing that is buying back stock, taking that cash and buying back stock. And that's exactly how we funded -- the $200 million that we have already bought back in the fiscal first quarter came from that, the funds from the sale-leaseback.\n\n---\n\nSo we've obviously observed some irrational pricing and promotional tactics from your friends down in Charlotte, I'm just wondering how you'd characterize the environment today. And I guess more importantly, how do you react -- I mean, to David's points a couple months ago, you guys have been great about investing in price to drive units. Do you feel like because of that activity today that you need to step up your investments to continue to accelerate the traffic in your stores?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think, Chuck, that is a very fair question. We do a lot of work on our sensitive items every month. We do a full book every quarter. And to be honest with you, the gap between me and that guy you mentioned has not narrowed at all. And I do think they have been more promotional, and I think they have publicly said they want to back out of that. I will tell you that we have responded on promotional items that we think are important to the consumer. But we're staying focused, true blue to everyday low price because we think, long term, that always wins.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Okay, great. And then I hopped on a couple minutes late, but given the weather choppiness in the fourth quarter, I didn't know if you went through the monthly cadence throughout the quarter. And as a follow-on to that, the spread between the 1,000 good stores and the 1,000 bad stores, there's been a lot of retailers that have talked about that gap being somewhere in that 700 to 900 basis point range, the sort of delta. Is that fairly consistent with what you guys saw when you look back?\n\n---\n\nYes, I will say this. We didn't talk about the cadence of the quarter. But I will tell you, January was the day that -- or January was the period in which the most affected days were there that we experienced. And the gap between the bottom 1,000 and the high 1,000, while we didn't call out a specific number, I will tell you it was significant.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just last question to follow on Paul's from earlier. When you do step back and you do heat maps on the productivity within the store by category, where do you feel like the biggest opportunity is to improve the sales productivity by category?\n\n---\n\nYes. I would tell you, Chuck, probably the non-consumable side. And believe it or not, not the apparel side, but the hardware, the automotive, the stuff where we think we really can play well in. And we're pleased with the assortment. We just think we need a little bit of help -- more help from the economy.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to follow up on the -- your answer to Peter Keith's question regarding accelerating same-store sales growth. Tobacco has been adding roughly 150 basis points to same-store sales. So taking that into account, your guidance implies comps maybe at 5% or better during the second half of the year. And yet, these non-tobacco categories have been struggling. You did indicate that you thought that the competitive pressures will be easier this year than last year. But what if that doesn't happen? What if, if anything, they become a bit more intense?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean -- yes, I think when I reflect back on -- we had a pretty solid quarter 2 and quarter 3. I think that I don't want to take quarter 4, where we obviously suffered severe, severe weather issues. And I think as we reflect on quarter 4, we have to remember that when the weather is bad, people don't come to Dollar General to stock up. They go to the more traditional retailer and they stock up there. And they go there for a number of reasons. Number one, we're limited in assortment, and more importantly, they can get what they want, right? There's a broader depth. You come to a Dollar General to buy sugar with another 15 or 16 people, and all of a sudden, there's no sugar. And then we don't deliver for another full week. So I don't think that you can necessarily look at everything that happened in quarter 4 and push that out going forward. I do think that tobacco, the point you're raising, is that it is adding to our comp line, and it's doing exactly what we want. We're not looking at the comp number. We're looking at the transactions it's driving. And again, if you look at the fourth quarter, we're one of very few retailers who called out the fact that we still had transaction growth. So I feel, as we move through the back half of the year, that tobacco is going to continue to do what it's been doing, deliver -- it's going to deliver transactions and then, more importantly, the attachment rate is continuing to grow. So I feel pretty solid, feel pretty good about the back half of the year, particularly when I roll in what we intend to do on the initiative side.\n\n---\n\nAnd then also just wanted to make sure I understood your answer regarding pricing at Family Dollar. It was, I guess, our understanding that their management believes a high-low pricing strategy was not competitive against Dollar General. And hence, they're moving to a pricing strategy very similar to yours. Do you think that makes them a stronger competitor against Dollar General? Or are you actually seeing opportunities that evolve from that transition on their part?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, I -- as I look at our price -- as I look at our pricing studies that are conducted on the most sensitive items, I continue to see a gap that was very similar to what it was 5 and 6 months ago. I do think that when you -- I do think when you deviate from EDLP, it takes a while to get that notion back into the customer's head. The customer is used to coming in and getting these onetime prices, right? And then it's hard to reestablish that, \"Hey, my price of Tide is good day in and day out.\" So I don't want to really speculate on someone else's pricing strategy or what they're doing. I'm just kind of saying we're very comfortable with where we are today and where we've been.\n\n---\n\nSo it's very tough to gauge the category performance given the weather issues. But in markets where weather wasn't or isn't a factor, do you see the spread between consumables and non-consumables growth getting narrower or wider?\n\n---\n\nI would say about the same that we've seen historically. I would not say that non-consumables is getting better, but I would also tell you it's not getting any worse. We have tobacco in there, too, Matt, which kind of distorts the consumable side.\n\n---\n\nAs you look at your 2014 guidance, is it fair to say that you don't have the non-consumables categories comping positive? And if not, do you think that, that's something that we could potentially see in '15 or '16?\n\n---\n\nI -- actually, we're quite bullish on the non-consumable side, and we're looking to see some solid comps on that side of the table in 2014.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just lastly, if you look at the 2014 class of new stores, how would you characterize the mix between new and existing markets? And does anything change versus recent history?\n\n---\n\nYes. Almost all of it will be in existing markets. We're going to add somewhere between 50 and 60 stores in California. However, we're looking at California as an existing market now. But we will probably not enter into any new markets in '14.\n\n---\n\nJust a question on the apparel strategy. You cut back on those 4,000 stores. Does that change your -- given the results, does that change your outlook on maybe the other 7,000 stores, perhaps cutting back there?\n\n---\n\nThat's actually a very fair question. We are actually, in those 4,000 stores, very pleased with the numbers we've seen. Now those stores were more space-constrained than our traditional store. And we made the decision there, Mark, not trying to be everything to everybody on every category. So I would look at you and tell you we haven't really arrived at that conclusion yet. I will tell you as we look at apparel, so far into this quarter, we're actually -- I wouldn't say pleased, but we're seeing some rays of hope in our apparel strategy.\n\n---\n\nThat's good. Then just a question -- I know you don't like to comment so much on the current quarter. But what I've heard from other retailers is February was actually even more weather-impacted than January. I'm wondering if you're seeing that when I think about that, when I look at your comp guidance for the quarter, first quarter versus the fiscal year. And so I'm wondering if you're seeing the same thing.\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean I will tell you, the first 15 days of February were very tough. I will also tell you the first 10 or 12 days of March were tough.\n\n---\n\nActually, I had some bigger-picture questions for you. And the first one goes to the planned changes for overtime rules that I think President Obama is going to lay out today. I think they're going to increase the $24,000 threshold. How should we think about that for you guys?\n\n---\n\nYes. I got to tell you, Scott, I haven't seen -- I've heard all kinds of speculation on it, where it's going to go, what's -- how significant that is. But I think where we are right now is we're kind of waiting to see what the president is going to do. I would be remiss if I didn't tell you that we are evaluating several scenarios and looking at what the impact is going to be. But again, I don't think it'll necessarily impact 2014, and it's going to impact everybody. And I'll tell you what I've always said to everybody on these calls. We are just a retailer, and whatever costs you can't remove from the system eventually gets passed on.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. I may follow up with you guys off-line about that in a little more detail. I want to actually move to a second one as we're long on the call. Just wanted to understand the, as you view it, Rick, the kind of the competitive advantage of just basically the dollar business. It's all about -- it's always been about convenience but also certainly price. It seems that the price component is fading a little bit. I know you, to Meredith's question, talked a little bit about gross margin you didn't chase. But it's hard not to notice the people like Delhaize, Dow Liquids [ph], the Food Lion, their volumes are now strongly positive. And in our own proprietary pricing surveys, we don't show the dollar business necessarily generally being priced much lower than some of the other competitors out there that also offer convenience. So just like from your point of view, I mean, where does this lead? I mean it seems like everyone is kind of around the same place right now. And how does a dollar business generally fit in with this new environment?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think the competitive landscape has suddenly decided that the dollar channel is a viable channel that can't be ignored any longer, and I think there's a lot of work being done on that. I will tell you, though, at the end of the day, what we bring to the table is the true value proposition. And the beauty of our model is -- the beauty of our model is a national brand is a national brand. And we have the ability to trade in and out of brands and always have the best value in front of the customer. And I'll also tell you the work that we're going to do in 2014 is all focused around that value proposition and giving the customer even more choices on those particular items. And again, I would look at everybody and say the environment has gotten very competitively intense. That does not sustain itself for a long, long period of time. And again, I fall back to where everyday low price, every day of the week on the basic necessities that the customer needs, and I think that's going to be -- that's going to serve us well into the future.\n\n---\n\nSo operator, thank you very much. And thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. Emma Jo and I are around if you have any other questions. And we look forward to speaking to you soon. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nProvided -- but I wanted to ask a question about operating income growth. Certainly, I understand that these factors, particularly the incentive comp, is very specific to 2014. But as we look beyond this upcoming year, I mean, do you -- are you stating that operating income growth can be back to at or better than top line growth going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nYes. Well, Paul, we're not giving specific guidance beyond 2014. But I did say in my prepared comments that we do think we've got some headwinds in 2014 that are -- that won't reoccur as we get out of 2014 and in 2015 and beyond. Specifically, we talked about the team share, the incentive comp being $35 million or about $0.07 a share, 18 basis points on SG&A. We talked about the Affordable Care Act. That's $10 million to $15 million or 5 to 8 basis points, $0.02 to $0.03 earnings per share. And then the sale-leaseback, although it doesn't hit earnings per share, it does hit the basis points on SG&A, and that was about $10 million. So we have some discrete items here that are impacting 2014. And again, as we get beyond 2014, we see these being more normalized and not being an impact as we get into 2015 and beyond. And again, we're just not giving specific guidance beyond 2014 at this point in time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nFair enough. And then just moving to the top line. If -- in addition to the weather, it was mentioned that there's consumer headwinds, taxes, health care, et cetera, along with some competitive headwinds with Walmart and others being promotional and also trying to open up small stores. Can you just go a little bit deeper into the top line initiatives and help us be comfortable with your ability to still comp 3% to 4% in 2014? What are you are expecting from the DG remodels? And what kind of lift are you seeing as you make these planogram changes? That would -- that color would be helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, Paul. I'll take that one. A couple things here. First of all, our remodel, relocation and new store program continues to be as healthy as ever. Our new stores continue to open up at 85% to 90% of our average comp number. I -- fact, I looked at some real estate numbers just yesterday, reviewing the 2013 projects, and they were tracking at almost 101% of our projection, so continue to be very, very healthy. I have historically laid out on this call, all of our initiatives going forward in a lot of detail. And I've elected this year, because of the intensity of the competitive environment out there, to choose to rather come back to you and tell you how we're doing once we get them done. But I will tell you that we are focused on SKU productivity. We actually believe we can do more in 2014 with less SKUs. We've examined a lot of categories, and we have discovered there are categories we can expand and categories that we're going to contract as we move through the year. We've become highly focused on not just work simplification but work elimination in the retail stores, which will free up our store managers and district managers to be more involved in the merchandising and store standards. We are also -- which I will report on as we move through the year, have developed what we are calling out a life cycle remodel, and the majority of these stores are undersized by our current standards. They're in the 5,700 to 6,500 square feet. And these are stores that historically, we might stand up and say, \"Hey, let's relocate them,\" but they're in keeper sites now. They're in good spots. We don't have the opportunity to expand them. And we've done some experimentation of going in and working this smaller store, and it's costing us about 30% to -- 30% less to remodel them, and we're generating a return that's 25% to 40% higher. And really what this involves is going in and refreshing the store up in terms of our new decor package and then making the commitment to the right categories that are in there. Rather than trying to play in every category, really focusing on those that are most productive. And then, of course, we're going to continue to stay focused on category management. And I know, Paul, that's kind of much broader than we historically have given you, but I would rather report this year on how we're doing versus laying it out on the table upfront.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nSo Peter, we missed the first part of what you were saying.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Keith (Analysts)】\nSure, I'll restart. When I look at the comp guidance for Q1 in the context of the full year guide, you're guiding 2% to 3%, so the full year guide of 3% to 4% implies some acceleration. At the same time, you're going to be lapping the tobacco rollout in the second quarter. So assuming you kind of have an easy compare in the fourth quarter, but I wanted to get some comfort around how you're thinking about the acceleration quarters 2 through 4.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, great question. We actually -- we're feeling very comfortable about the merchandising initiatives that are starting to roll out. We are actually getting ready to do our spring roadshow, where we could go out, Peter, and lay all those out for the store managers. We're very comfortable there. And we're also -- quite honestly, I think the competitive environment is going to settle down. And really intense competitor -- competitive environments have a habit of coming and going, and when that does happen, I believe the role of EDLP is going to be even more important than the promotional activity that we've seen recently. So -- and I also think -- I fall back to what we said in our comments, when mother nature is not interfering with what's going on, we're pleased with what we're seeing. And I know the groundhog is getting every bit they can out of seeing their shadow this year, but we think the good spring weather is coming.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nYes. I just want to jump on the weather piece of it, that, in so far, in first quarter, we have continued to have a weather impact. And that plays a big role in how we set our guidance for the quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Keith (Analysts)】\nOkay, very good. On the weather, certainly, you guys are going to have some disruption with closures. I was curious more on the backdrop of energy costs. Have you seen sort of an overhang in some of the cold weather-impacted markets of lower comp, as maybe the discretionary income of your customers has come down a bit?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes. I can tell you, if I took -- it's interesting you brought this up. We took the 1,000 store -- took the bottom 1,000 stores that were in the hardest hit in regard to temperature and compared them to 1,000 stores that were in areas that weren't as severely impacted by the weather. And Peter, the significant change in the comp -- it's significant, the difference in the comp. I attribute that to 2 things: number one, the weather. I do think that we do know that natural gas and propane are both going to be up significantly for the consumer, and we might be seeing some of those higher heating bills working their way through now. So it's a little bit of both.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judah Frommer (Analysts)】\nIt's actually Judah on for Ed. Just wanted to first follow up on just the operating margin guidance. And I think even x the items that you called out, the growth is a little lower than we expected, which seems like there may be some gross margin impact that's more than we anticipated. Can you talk a little bit more, beyond tobacco, about what's going on with the gross margin? You called out kind of the macro was hurting that a little bit also.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nYes. I'll take it off, and then, please jump in, Rick. As we look at our gross margin for the year, clearly, the first half of the year is being impacted by tobacco, particularly the first quarter, but also in the second quarter. And then as we get to the back half of the year, that mitigates. And right now, we are actually forecasting that as we get into third and fourth quarter, we should start seeing some leverage in gross margin. So I don't think there's a whole lot besides the tobacco impact to talk about here. On the first -- we talked about shrink. We see shrink improving as we go through the year. And again, that will be more second half-based than first half-based. We're still dealing with that a little bit here in the first part of the year. But besides those items, I don't think there are many other items in gross margin that would have an impact.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judah Frommer (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just a follow-up. Can you talk a little bit about the comments out of Walmart that they're going to be expanding their small store rollout. It's currently not a huge number of stores, but there is focus on that Express format that maybe competes a little bit more with you guys.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, Walmart is a fabulous competitor. There is absolutely no doubt about it. I think, though, Judah, if you look at it, their primary focus is the neighborhood store. They're talking about adding 100 Express stores, I think, this coming year, and primarily, their focus is on the neighborhood market. And we're going to open up over 700 stores. So I think we've got a significant lead here, and we'll just have to see how that one plays out.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Boss (Analysts)】\nSo as we think about your model beyond 2014, is it fair to think about a 3% comp or so, flattish gross margins and a low-single-digit leverage point as kind of a baseline? Any color you can kind of give us on how to think about the model over a multiyear basis would be really helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nYes. I think I'll have to go back to my earlier comment that we know we have items in 2014, the team share, the Affordable Care Act and the sale-leaseback that are having an impact, particularly on our SG&A and our operating profit [ph] if you go to the bottom line. That should be more normalized as we get outside of 2014. But again, beyond that, we're just not giving guidance over and beyond 2014 at this point in time.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nMatt, I would say is what David's calling out is spot on. I would say to you that we have a long track record, though, of really good results, so I wouldn't let 2014 influence me looking forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Boss (Analysts)】\nRight. On the same-store sales front, the 3% to 4%, I think you -- on our math, you basically get 200 basis points just from the store opening waterfall and relocations. Just kind of trying to plug the delta between the 3% to 4% and the 2%. I guess that's some of the merchandising initiatives that you said are still to come.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nThat's exactly right. We call out, historically, 1.5% to 2% on the real estate program. And then the rest is what we're going to do going through the course of the year to drive traffic and sales.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Boss (Analysts)】\nAnd then last question on the square footage front. So last call, you raised the saturation target about 40% to 14,000. Have you seen anything competitively that would relate to the availability of sites? And one thing I was wondering is would you guys consider acceleration? Is that an opportunity if a key competitor were to slow the growth for a few years here?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes. I think the issue of accelerating our new store growth is one that David and I wrestle with all the time. We are very much into organizational capacity. And if you think about it, every year that we've been together here as a team, we've upped the number of new stores that we've opened. And what we don't want to do is get ourselves into the jam the company got itself into several years ago, where it actually had to come in and close 400 stores because in the rush to open new stores, we were more focused on quantity rather than quality. And I would rather guide open 700 stores and open them right than open 850 and be marginal. So it's something we wrestle with all the time. It's a very fair question. But right now, we're very comfortable with the number of stores we're going to open.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nSo let me start with, strategically, when you look at the discretionary categories, right, which have struggled for a couple of years here, is -- how do you think about that business longer term in terms of -- I think you've cut back a little bit on apparel. But really thinking about getting a major change there in terms of space allocation, what you carry in terms of SKUs, maybe you cut back toys, categories that are hard to compete in beyond convenience, how you think about revitalizing that business? Or is it just a matter of the economy getting better?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nActually, John, it's a combination of both. We've said all along that we're really comfortable with the steps we've taken in non-consumables in terms of the branding, how the products position in the stores, the quality, the fact that we've been able to improve the quality and reduce the price to the consumer, and we are going to need some help with the economy. Having said that, though, Phase 5 is the perfect example of how we're looking at everything, in that we're saying that every category has to carry its own water in the store. And if you look at the fact that we have reduced hanging apparel in some areas, we are committed to getting the store balanced properly. But saying -- having said all of that, we think the non-consumables side of the business is incredibly important. We are today's general store, and getting that offering moving, we think, is incredibly important to the overall mix and to our value [ph] proposition. So we're very committed, and we're still committed to it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nAll right. And then 2 final things. If you -- we had talked, I think, on the last call or the one before that, maybe migrating some of the learnings from DG Market into the rest of the box, particularly something like produce. Any updated thought on that? And then, secondly, how aggressive do you think you'll be in trying -- and how much of an opportunity do you think it is going after the CVS tobacco customer? Big opportunity? Do you go after that aggressively? Or is that just kind of whatever falls into your lap happens?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, 2 good questions. We continue to experiment with Dollar General Market. John, I grew up selling produce and meat, and it's pretty easy for me. But it's very difficult teaching somebody how to sell it when they're not used to selling it in terms of rotation, how you order it, how you mark it down, how you keep it fresh. And right now, I don't see a lot of movement like moving produce items into the traditional DG. I will tell you, Todd and his team have made some learnings on the perishables side, the cooler side, that we've been able to move into the traditional Dollar General stores, that are beneficial. In regards to the CVS thing, I think what happens when someone gives up a category like that, those sales just tend to go where they're going to go. I think we'll get our share of it, but I don't think it's going to be more than that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nI'd like to start by just talking a little bit about the gross margin. And I know there's been a bunch of questions about it, but I actually want to be a little backward-looking. And you had a very tough comparison this fourth, and clearly, shrink was a negative. The mix wasn't particularly a positive. And yet, the gross margin was much better. Can you talk about maybe what the factors were? You talked about the cost of products. But is that about global sourcing or something else?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nYes. Our IMU was definitely better, and our net purchase cost, ultimately, was better in the quarter than we had in our original guidance forecast. And I think there are a whole variety of factors that go into that, Meredith. And quite honestly, it's a little hard to dissect and say exactly how much is due to what, but you're definitely hitting on it there. A piece of it would be a little better activity going on in our foreign sourcing. We continue to expand products that we're sourcing other places. We now do trash bags out of Thailand, crackers out of Colombia. We have $1 pasta out of Italy. We're doing some $1 lotions out of Mexico. It goes on and on. So we continue to be very, very, very innovative with what we're doing with our foreign sourcing. And then I think just the merchants and the buyers did a better job overall in terms of the -- how they were able to partner with the vendors and the types of deals that they were able to get for Dollar General. So I think it's a whole variety of things.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nAnd I think, Meredith, I'll throw out one thing, too. I think the -- it was our feeling the environment was incredibly price competitive. And people were throwing prices during extreme weather conditions that I don't think people were going to respond to anyway because they couldn't get to the store or they'd already stocked up. And we chose not to play in that, and we focused ourselves on taking care of the inventory we had in the store.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nOkay. And I guess, David, back to what you were saying. Is there any reason to believe that the sort of tailwinds you have in the gross margin aren't going to continue? You didn't use up all the opportunities you had.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nWe still have a lot of opportunity in our private label, our foreign sourcing and our shrink. Again, let's not forget shrink because shrink, unfortunately, has been going the other way now for several quarters. So again, we continue to work those areas. And I think the question we have, Meredith, and we've talked about this before, is how much of that do we invest in price, staying true to EDLP, driving units to the box and growing margin versus letting fall to the bottom line because we've said publicly several times that the most important thing for us is making sure we are the EDLP operator and that we continue to grow our market share. So we'll have decisions to make on those private label, sourcing, et cetera, the pluses we get there, how much of that do we let fall through and how much of it do we invest in price.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then I've got another question. You actually said something that surprised me a little bit about changes being made with the rolltainers and how -- stuff that goes in them. And I was under the impression that the rolltainers  were already sorted by aisle, and that was the whole point of having rolltainers. Is that not true?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nThat is 100% true, but we've taken and refined it even further, where the product actually comes out how it's laid out on the shelf. So imagine all the detergent used to show up for the detergent aisle, and now we're trying to lay the rolltainer out where it actually matches to the shelf by the planogram.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nWow, that's great. And then I just have one other quick question. You did a sale-leaseback, and I believe that you have been buying -- you're doing fee development for a while now. Is there significantly more owned real estate that you would consider monetizing? And presumably, if you did -- not that you have a cash flow shortage, but that you would also use that to buy back stock?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nThere are other opportunities in our real estate area to do that if we wanted to. We don't have any plans right now to capitalize on that at this point in time. So I would say just stay tuned, and it may be something that we'll do in the future as we evaluate doing incremental share buybacks. I do want to stress, when we do something like that, and we demonstrated this with what we did when we closed the deal in January, the main reason for doing that is buying back stock, taking that cash and buying back stock. And that's exactly how we funded -- the $200 million that we have already bought back in the fiscal first quarter came from that, the funds from the sale-leaseback.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nSo we've obviously observed some irrational pricing and promotional tactics from your friends down in Charlotte, I'm just wondering how you'd characterize the environment today. And I guess more importantly, how do you react -- I mean, to David's points a couple months ago, you guys have been great about investing in price to drive units. Do you feel like because of that activity today that you need to step up your investments to continue to accelerate the traffic in your stores?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes. I think, Chuck, that is a very fair question. We do a lot of work on our sensitive items every month. We do a full book every quarter. And to be honest with you, the gap between me and that guy you mentioned has not narrowed at all. And I do think they have been more promotional, and I think they have publicly said they want to back out of that. I will tell you that we have responded on promotional items that we think are important to the consumer. But we're staying focused, true blue to everyday low price because we think, long term, that always wins.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nGreat. Okay, great. And then I hopped on a couple minutes late, but given the weather choppiness in the fourth quarter, I didn't know if you went through the monthly cadence throughout the quarter. And as a follow-on to that, the spread between the 1,000 good stores and the 1,000 bad stores, there's been a lot of retailers that have talked about that gap being somewhere in that 700 to 900 basis point range, the sort of delta. Is that fairly consistent with what you guys saw when you look back?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, I will say this. We didn't talk about the cadence of the quarter. But I will tell you, January was the day that -- or January was the period in which the most affected days were there that we experienced. And the gap between the bottom 1,000 and the high 1,000, while we didn't call out a specific number, I will tell you it was significant.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just last question to follow on Paul's from earlier. When you do step back and you do heat maps on the productivity within the store by category, where do you feel like the biggest opportunity is to improve the sales productivity by category?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes. I would tell you, Chuck, probably the non-consumable side. And believe it or not, not the apparel side, but the hardware, the automotive, the stuff where we think we really can play well in. And we're pleased with the assortment. We just think we need a little bit of help -- more help from the economy.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nI wanted to follow up on the -- your answer to Peter Keith's question regarding accelerating same-store sales growth. Tobacco has been adding roughly 150 basis points to same-store sales. So taking that into account, your guidance implies comps maybe at 5% or better during the second half of the year. And yet, these non-tobacco categories have been struggling. You did indicate that you thought that the competitive pressures will be easier this year than last year. But what if that doesn't happen? What if, if anything, they become a bit more intense?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, I mean -- yes, I think when I reflect back on -- we had a pretty solid quarter 2 and quarter 3. I think that I don't want to take quarter 4, where we obviously suffered severe, severe weather issues. And I think as we reflect on quarter 4, we have to remember that when the weather is bad, people don't come to Dollar General to stock up. They go to the more traditional retailer and they stock up there. And they go there for a number of reasons. Number one, we're limited in assortment, and more importantly, they can get what they want, right? There's a broader depth. You come to a Dollar General to buy sugar with another 15 or 16 people, and all of a sudden, there's no sugar. And then we don't deliver for another full week. So I don't think that you can necessarily look at everything that happened in quarter 4 and push that out going forward. I do think that tobacco, the point you're raising, is that it is adding to our comp line, and it's doing exactly what we want. We're not looking at the comp number. We're looking at the transactions it's driving. And again, if you look at the fourth quarter, we're one of very few retailers who called out the fact that we still had transaction growth. So I feel, as we move through the back half of the year, that tobacco is going to continue to do what it's been doing, deliver -- it's going to deliver transactions and then, more importantly, the attachment rate is continuing to grow. So I feel pretty solid, feel pretty good about the back half of the year, particularly when I roll in what we intend to do on the initiative side.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nAnd then also just wanted to make sure I understood your answer regarding pricing at Family Dollar. It was, I guess, our understanding that their management believes a high-low pricing strategy was not competitive against Dollar General. And hence, they're moving to a pricing strategy very similar to yours. Do you think that makes them a stronger competitor against Dollar General? Or are you actually seeing opportunities that evolve from that transition on their part?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, I -- as I look at our price -- as I look at our pricing studies that are conducted on the most sensitive items, I continue to see a gap that was very similar to what it was 5 and 6 months ago. I do think that when you -- I do think when you deviate from EDLP, it takes a while to get that notion back into the customer's head. The customer is used to coming in and getting these onetime prices, right? And then it's hard to reestablish that, \"Hey, my price of Tide is good day in and day out.\" So I don't want to really speculate on someone else's pricing strategy or what they're doing. I'm just kind of saying we're very comfortable with where we are today and where we've been.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matt Nemer (Analysts)】\nSo it's very tough to gauge the category performance given the weather issues. But in markets where weather wasn't or isn't a factor, do you see the spread between consumables and non-consumables growth getting narrower or wider?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nI would say about the same that we've seen historically. I would not say that non-consumables is getting better, but I would also tell you it's not getting any worse. We have tobacco in there, too, Matt, which kind of distorts the consumable side.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matt Nemer (Analysts)】\nAs you look at your 2014 guidance, is it fair to say that you don't have the non-consumables categories comping positive? And if not, do you think that, that's something that we could potentially see in '15 or '16?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nI -- actually, we're quite bullish on the non-consumable side, and we're looking to see some solid comps on that side of the table in 2014.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matt Nemer (Analysts)】\nAnd then just lastly, if you look at the 2014 class of new stores, how would you characterize the mix between new and existing markets? And does anything change versus recent history?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes. Almost all of it will be in existing markets. We're going to add somewhere between 50 and 60 stores in California. However, we're looking at California as an existing market now. But we will probably not enter into any new markets in '14.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Montagna (Analysts)】\nJust a question on the apparel strategy. You cut back on those 4,000 stores. Does that change your -- given the results, does that change your outlook on maybe the other 7,000 stores, perhaps cutting back there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nThat's actually a very fair question. We are actually, in those 4,000 stores, very pleased with the numbers we've seen. Now those stores were more space-constrained than our traditional store. And we made the decision there, Mark, not trying to be everything to everybody on every category. So I would look at you and tell you we haven't really arrived at that conclusion yet. I will tell you as we look at apparel, so far into this quarter, we're actually -- I wouldn't say pleased, but we're seeing some rays of hope in our apparel strategy.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Montagna (Analysts)】\nThat's good. Then just a question -- I know you don't like to comment so much on the current quarter. But what I've heard from other retailers is February was actually even more weather-impacted than January. I'm wondering if you're seeing that when I think about that, when I look at your comp guidance for the quarter, first quarter versus the fiscal year. And so I'm wondering if you're seeing the same thing.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes. I mean I will tell you, the first 15 days of February were very tough. I will also tell you the first 10 or 12 days of March were tough.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nActually, I had some bigger-picture questions for you. And the first one goes to the planned changes for overtime rules that I think President Obama is going to lay out today. I think they're going to increase the $24,000 threshold. How should we think about that for you guys?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes. I got to tell you, Scott, I haven't seen -- I've heard all kinds of speculation on it, where it's going to go, what's -- how significant that is. But I think where we are right now is we're kind of waiting to see what the president is going to do. I would be remiss if I didn't tell you that we are evaluating several scenarios and looking at what the impact is going to be. But again, I don't think it'll necessarily impact 2014, and it's going to impact everybody. And I'll tell you what I've always said to everybody on these calls. We are just a retailer, and whatever costs you can't remove from the system eventually gets passed on.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. I may follow up with you guys off-line about that in a little more detail. I want to actually move to a second one as we're long on the call. Just wanted to understand the, as you view it, Rick, the kind of the competitive advantage of just basically the dollar business. It's all about -- it's always been about convenience but also certainly price. It seems that the price component is fading a little bit. I know you, to Meredith's question, talked a little bit about gross margin you didn't chase. But it's hard not to notice the people like Delhaize, Dow Liquids [ph], the Food Lion, their volumes are now strongly positive. And in our own proprietary pricing surveys, we don't show the dollar business necessarily generally being priced much lower than some of the other competitors out there that also offer convenience. So just like from your point of view, I mean, where does this lead? I mean it seems like everyone is kind of around the same place right now. And how does a dollar business generally fit in with this new environment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes. I think the competitive landscape has suddenly decided that the dollar channel is a viable channel that can't be ignored any longer, and I think there's a lot of work being done on that. I will tell you, though, at the end of the day, what we bring to the table is the true value proposition. And the beauty of our model is -- the beauty of our model is a national brand is a national brand. And we have the ability to trade in and out of brands and always have the best value in front of the customer. And I'll also tell you the work that we're going to do in 2014 is all focused around that value proposition and giving the customer even more choices on those particular items. And again, I would look at everybody and say the environment has gotten very competitively intense. That does not sustain itself for a long, long period of time. And again, I fall back to where everyday low price, every day of the week on the basic necessities that the customer needs, and I think that's going to be -- that's going to serve us well into the future.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mary Winn Pilkington (Executives)】\nSo operator, thank you very much. And thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. Emma Jo and I are around if you have any other questions. And we look forward to speaking to you soon. Thank you.",

      "transcript_text1": "Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Raia Drogasil results presentation for the fourth quarter of 2013. As always, Eugenio will present the highlights of the year. And just before to Q&A, I would like to discuss a few points about 2013, and our challenges for 2014. Eugenio, please?\n\n---\n\nHello, everybody. Thank you for attending the conference call. To start with, I'd like to give an overview for the year. \r\nWe believe 2013 was a year full of contrasts. It was a very disappointing year in terms of financial results. We -- this was a year we were definitely not happy about. But at same time, it was a year of significant breakthroughs, towards building the vision that we had at the time of the merger for the company. As we have significant advances in our integration, as we have -- as we're preparing the company for a new leap in execution, for a leap in service in terms of consumers, and for a leap in creating value for our shareholders. \r\nWe opened in the year 967 stores -- sorry, we ended the year with 967 stores. We opened a total of 131 stores, which is a national record, not only for the company, but for the Brazilian drug store sector and maybe for the Brazilian retail sector at large, we're not sure about that, but at least I haven't seen any reference for an opening pace like this. We have also closed 24 stores as part of our closure program, that has already been concluded, and that's our closure program that we had intended to do and has communicated and foresees high [indiscernible] together.\r\nWe've gained BRL 6.5 billion revenues last year. We grew 15.6% with 9.3% of same-store sales. It's very important to highlight that we had added in the year BRL 0.9 billion, even during the [indiscernible]. So we added fully organically, our mass of revenues equivalent for the eighth largest drug supplier in Brazil, so it's very significant. \r\nWe recorded an EBITDA of BRL 357 million, a margin of 5.5%, and an increase of 9.6%. So as I mentioned, we lost 0.2 percentage points in EBITDA margin versus the previous year as a result of mature stores not growing in line as inflation, and as a result of the loss of operating leverage that we had at our start. \r\nNet income on an adjusted basis totaled BRL 176 million, with a net margin of 2.7%. And one of the highlights of the year was the fact that we've generated positive free cash flow of BRL 45 million, in spite of the weaker results in the year, and in spite of a very strong investment program undertook last year. And even when you consider interests, interest on own capital, we still posted a positive BRL 22 million in total cash flow generation. So cash sustainability, something very important for us and it's something that we believe to keep posting from now on. \r\nOn Page 4, talking about our growth. As we mentioned, we opened 131 stores. We closed 24 stores and we suspended 4 stores during the year. Suspensions means stores that are temporarily closed for rebranding, generally from RaiaDrogasil to Farmasil, but sometimes even from Raia to Drogasil or vice versa. \r\nThe 24 closures that we had, they have been part of our synergy program announced since the time of the merger. If you consider the last 2 years, we closed a total of 37 stores in the program. But it's important to highlight that a very small number of stores that we have closed in this period is related to store development mistakes in the recent years. \r\nOnly 12 stores of the 37 has been open since 2010. \r\nSo we talk about, in average, we had 6 stores per year that we can consider mistakes in our investment program. And this is a reasonable pace closing 5, 6 stores per year, and this is what we expect for 2014. But the other 25 stores have been legacy stores that have been closed due to the portfolio optimization that we did. So we have very often 2 stores that were subpar stores even if positive, they were side by side. So we have significant opportunities to close more stores to migrate revenues to the surviving store, and to end up with 1 good store, instead of 2 dead stores. \r\nThe program has been concluded now, and from now on, we still close stores, but that's part of the normal life, and we expect a rate of 5, 6, 7 per year, not more than that. \r\nBy the year end, the each structure infrastructure of our portfolio includes a 33% stores still undergoing mature changes. So these are stores that are not generating their full potential, and as the stores mature they will become a significant lever of profitability for the company. \r\nPage 5. We did not enter in many new markets last year. So we stayed in the same store markets that we had before. That account for nearly 83% of the Brazilian pharmaceutical markets. So it's a very broad geographic presence. Out of the 967 stores had by year end, 495 were Drogasil or Farmasil. So another subline of the [indiscernible]. We had classified as Drogasil. When we achieve our record scale, we can start separating Farmasil, but as of now, we don't think it's worth. For Raia 472 stores in total.\r\nWe are publishing comparable market shares. This is the market share, excluding newly formed and added to IMS panel during the year. So we had on a comparable market share growth, over 0.3 percentage points from 9.4% to 9.7% at a national level. We posted a slight margin loss in São Paulo 0.1 percentage point. I would like the margin gain in the Southeast. We should not include São Paulo, so the Southeast is basically, [indiscernible], Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro, and than a strong gains in the Midwest, in the South and the Northeast. \r\nIf you consider the new stores not open, the new informants added to the base during the year. We've are now at historical comparability, we're going to add the last year 9.4% of share. But we cannot compare that figure with the previous year, because it's 2 different base of informants. The comparable number is 0.2% on national overall. \r\nOn Page 6, we discussed our revenue  growth for the year. Last year was a challenging year in terms of sales by any means. We grew 15% over the whole year, and it's important to mention that the closing and suspension of stores impacted our numbers by 1.2 percentage points. So we would have 16.8% not considering the stores that will close or suspended. We ended the fourth quarter already in a much better pace of 17.5% growth. Same-store sales grew 11.6% -- grew 9.3% for the year, but in the fourth quarter, you already 11.9%, which is a good number. And for a mature stores, 4.7% for the whole year versus 6.0% for the fourth quarter. So we ended the year with our stores in line with inflation. And this was very important for us, and this is something that happened that helped a lot in the fourth quarter numbers. And that had a positive trend for mature store growth above inflation for 2014. We probably start in the first quarter already. \r\nTalking about our product mix, the highlight of the year was OTC. We benefited from shifting OTC exposure -- product exposure from behind the counter to the front store at higher, and as the Brazilian stores that we progressively renovated. We have also brought OTC to the front stores. So this has helped. All the category we feel like [indiscernible]. This is a very important category, it's a category that have not been well developed by our suppliers. But last year, we had a great year in vitamins where we were the market leader, which is several launch of several new items. We improved this execution. Our private label also helped and the 2 brands they pushed the whole category. So what you see was a very good number. \r\nGeneric has been challenging and we don't deny that. Over the full year, we lost 0.2 percentage points. And the fourth quarter was particularly very challenging with 11, only 11.2% of penetration for generics. What happened here is that we are swimming upstream. So what happens here is that we haven't had any new generics launched. So our whole improvement now depends on our execution. We wanted to at least maintain generic offer not growing based on improved mix in execution of generics. I think the [indiscernible] of Drogasil will be instrumental to push generics penetration and even at Raia we have things that we can do to better deliver generics penetration. \r\nOn Page 8, let's discuss our gross margins for the year and our cash cycle. We increased gross margins 0.1, so pretty much in line over the previous year. But when we look at the fourth quarter, we've seen 0.4 percentage point gross margin contradiction. There's nothing wrong with the fourth quarter of this year. What happened is that the fourth quarter of last year was very, very high, by any means a big number. Both numbers are fully comparable because the tax impacts that we had due to the new tax regime that we adopted during the whole 2013, it happened before that. So in both quarters, both the fourth quarter '12 and '13, that we have a full comparable base. But the fourth quarter '12, came after a very weak 3 quarter '12, where we had grown only -- only had a gross margin of only 26.2%. So probably, we had the higher -- the high concentration of trade allowances in the fourth quarter as it pushed the third quarter of last year. When we consider 26.7%, this is absolutely in line with the performance of our -- that we had in every nonseasonal quarter last year. So we had 26.8% in the third quarter. We had 26.6% in the fourth quarter. The second quarter was not very high, but this is a seasonable -- our seasonal quarter in which followed by an inflationary gains on events generally produces very high margin levels. \r\nLast year, we've given sales that way as we don't do any forward buying, and as we had a change in purchasing model that ends the benefit from the [indiscernible]. But when you compare the fourth quarter with every nonseasonal quarter last year, it was pretty much in line. So this is not -- there is nothing wrong here. And we've now -- in December, we left the previous tax regime, and we're back to the tax substitution regime. This will help our margin by approximately 0.4 percentage points. And we believe, we'll see the whole margin improvement booked in already in the second quarter of the year, after the whole inventory has been rotated. And other important feature to explain here is that, as we got back to the tax substitution execution, which is a much better -- achieved on gross margins. We have a penalty impact cycle because at end of the tax execution regime, we buy all of the merchandises. This was tax already pre-collected by our suppliers. \r\nWhile in the regime that we just opted out from, we used to pay taxes only when we transferred items from the DCs to the stores. So to answer there is tax regime, we had to pay taxes on inventory. So basically inventory accounts and we paid the taxes to the state on those inventors. These taxes or advantages represent BRL 4.1 billion of cash cycle that we boost already in the fourth quarter of the year. \r\nSo when you look at the cash cycle. Even though, it looks like we've already improved BRL 1.1 days. The reality is that on a comparable basis, taking out the tax effect, we will have a cash cycle improvement of 5.9 days, this is very, very significant. And this has been boosted by our very important inventory levels that should as we pursued over the whole 2013. \r\nIn the fourth quarter, we ended with 84.8 days of inventories, and an improvement of 1.5 days of inventories, even considering that our cash cycle increased by 4.1 days, as a consequence of the adoption on the tax substitution. So if you don't consider that, then we have a very strong inventory reserves. Shown on a comparable basis, inventory went down significantly, cash cycle went down significantly in such a way that is absorbed the tax penalty. So that to get back to the new tax regime, and if you allow a small 1 day -- 1.8 day gains to subsidies.\r\nAnother important thing to highlight here is that as we had decreased opportunities, especially in generics, over the whole year, over the most of the year, after we paid the last outstanding devices in the second and third quarters specifically, our cash cycle was penalized by a very low base of accounts payable. Now as we are now -- after reducing inventory we are now replenishing. Normally, our accounts payable had got back to where they should be. So this help show the effect of the inventory that was previously offset by transitory penalty accounts payable. \r\nOn Page 9, talking about sales expenses. Our sales expenses increased 0.7% -- percentage points in the year. So out of the increase, 0.3% was payroll increases, 0.2% was rentals and 0.2% was marketing. And something that's important to mention here remains in our reach margins went up by 0.3 -- 0.2 was a choice that we made, it was the market investment that we made. The point here is that our immediate horizon is not the quarter and it's not the year. We do whatever it takes to be successful in the middle-term in the longer-term. These markets investments certainly did not pay off last year. But it's very important and it pays off over a longer term. So, whenever, we have to pick a choice, of posting beautiful numbers or of doing what's right, we do what's right. And this is I think a very, very good example of that. \r\nWhen you look at the fourth quarter, we had now flat sales expenses performance, which, I think -- which we deal as a victory. Maintaining sales performance, sales expense is flat. In an inflationary environment, we think, it's a very good number. And the main reasons on, why we have been able to do that in the fourth quarter is: first, better expense control; second, to stop closures are helping because we took off the less productive stores; and third, we are seeing a better sales environment. And as a result, we're achieving better revenues. People think of sales expenses as variable, but they are not variable. Payroll and rent are fixed. When the revenues are good, dilution is good, when revenues are down, dilution doesn't happen. \r\nSo the sales performance is dependent on sales expenses. \r\nNext page, G&A. We have been very successful in diluting G&A. Ever since the merger of RaiaDrogasil, we have maintained the quarter generic constant inflation and inflation-adjusted terms. So the total number of G&A has increased only by inflation ever since our merger. While the number of stores that we have simplified, decreased by 20%. As a result of the dilution, we saw last year a 0.3 percentage point dilution in G&A, both in the year and in the fourth quarter. And we expect to keep diluting G&A in 2014 and maybe 2015. \r\nAs a result, we had a 0.3 percentage points pressure in the annual EBITDA. As I mentioned previously, with the sales scenario, we know each mature stores grew below inflation and at a loss of operating leverage. And we also saw a recovery in the fourth quarter by maintaining for the first time in the year, the same margins of the previous year. \r\nSomething that we highlight here, is the impact of the stores open in the calendar year over the fourth quarter performance. So we started -- we had in the fourth quarter of the year 836 stores that had -- that were already in operation in December of 2012. \r\nSo in 2012, by year end, we had reached even a higher number of stores, but then we closed some. So 836 at the existing stores that were in operation ever since the end of the fourth quarter. So these stores are low not considering these new stores that have been excluding year, they posted in the quarter BRL 1.6 billion gross revenues, BRL 104 million of EBITDA, full absorbing corporate G&A and logistics and then they posted 6.4% of EBITDA in the fourth quarter over a higher -- sorry, slightly lower revenue base. So these highlights, the impact of the new stores and our profitability. Whenever you look at valuation and if you forget that we have opened a lot of recent stores that are still generating managing productivity. But we create value over their maturation term. I think, it's important to consider that to see the whole picture. \r\nPage 12, depreciation increased 0.3 percentage points in the year due to the acceleration in our investment program, and increased 0.2 percentage points in the fourth quarter. Financial expenses also increased 0.2 in the year, as we maintained the year, an average net debt higher than the previous year. But as the net debt includes significant in the fourth quarter, we maintained a constant net financial expenses of 0.1 percentage points. Then taxes that includes significantly as we have goodwill amortization. So 0.7 percentage points increase an improvement over the previous year. When we compare the fourth quarter, we're comparing a quarter in which we had goodwill -- taxes from goodwill over the whole quarter this year. First of the quarter in 2012 I think, only in December, we had got good goodwill, the tax shield on goodwill. So it's not fully comparable, but it helped increase adjusted profitability by 0.6 percentage points in the fourth quarter. \r\nAnd as a result, we had a slight net income increase of 0.1 percentage points on an adjusted basis, and a 0.4 percentage points increase in the fourth quarter. \r\nPage 14, I would like to give a lot of emphasis on nonrecurring expenses. We are in the mid of a significant change program due to the integration of RaiaDrogasil, We have got significant advances in the end of 2013. And in the beginning of 2014, we had finished the corporate integration and we have, we are paving the way now for in-store [ph] check up seasonally Marcílio will cover that into a higher level detail. But what happens here is that we don't expect the level of change we're affecting without nonrecurring expenses. And we give you full disclosure of nonrecurring expenses. So that any investor can understand it, and consider it in any way that you see fit. So we think over the full year BRL 48.5 million in nonrecurring expenses. It's a high number, we know it, but it's the cost of doing the integration into the company that we are building. In the fourth quarter alone it was BRL 14.5 million. The point I would like to stress here is that, already from the first quarter of 2014, we see already a core reduction in nonrecurring expenses, and for various reasons. \r\nLast year, we spent BRL 15.5 million in store closures. This is basically noncash asset writeoffs, but we've few expenses. Now, the store closures will be 0 because even though, will be closing couple of stores, 5, 6 stores there will be part of the recurring profitability in the company. The program is over. The program is successfully concluded. So already in January, when you look at our nonrecurring expenses, you'll see 0 in store closures. As a matter of fact, same store, we have BRL 13.3 million in the year. We subsidized the stores that lost their licenses incorporation over the years that we recovered the licenses those expense started last year, with BRL 5.5 million in the first quarter, and drop significantly into BRL 1.8 million in the last quarter. And now you have 0 for the first quarter of '14, as every single or regional store that is already fully relicensed up and running the program. \r\nSeverance expenses. We had BRL 9.1 million severance expenses. We had changes in the management structure of the company. We had restructurings and people leaving the company. And in the fourth quarter, you can see an increase in severance of BRL 4.4 million. What happens here is that we have -- we still have some severance expense for next year. But we have  reason to those expenses in the fourth quarter. So as we're using the provision for next year, we will also book zero nonrecurring expenses, as far as our severance expense. And finally, we book last year BRL 7.1 million in consulting expenses. We still have consulting expenses, but to a lesser degree. \r\nSo nonrecurring expenses will not be 0, especially in the first quarter consulting expenses would be existent because we had support of consultants to conclude the corporate integration. We still have some level of consulting taking place to support us in integration, but a much lower expense item. So I think, nonrecurring expenses from next year will be a very, very low number. \r\nOn Page 15, I'd like to give more color on our free cash flow, which I think was one of the highlight of the year. We generated an operating cash flow of BRL 282 million in the year, already considering working capital. We invested a significant amount of BRL 236.8 million that we had in the year. Not only, we opened 131 stores, but we have also accelerated renovation of new stores -- of existing stores, especially, [indiscernible]. So we had a free cash flow of BRL 45 million, I mean, actually, this is significant. We take a year in nearly we invested BRL 236 million, a year in which our performance was deteriorated, and we lost operating margins to BRL 45 million of free cash flow. I think, this is an achievement. And then due to this amount was given sufficient to pay interest on our equity on our cash basis and of BRL 29 million, to pay net financial expenses, net of the respective taxes, and  to post a total cash flow of BRL 22 million in the year. \r\nOn Page 16, this is something, we don't talk much, but I think, it's sorry -- but I think, it's important to highlight. I mean, we want to add even before the merger, we had a very significant commitment to sustainability to the group of bottom line. I think, we had a very strong social inclusion programs and social mobilization programs, I mean that our momentum initiatives lastly. We have not shed enough light on the in the past. I think, it's important to disclose or discuss what we're doing. We have a model social inclusion project in Brazil. We employ more than 900 handicapped employees as part of the side-by-side project, and they're fully located -- fully deployed over store. We're not the only company in Brazil to have handicapped people. This is even a legal requirement. The difference is that we're not hiding our people in the distribution centers, in call centers, we are putting them in stores where their social inclusion is full in which the clients see what they'll do and appreciate, what we're doing. So this is something, we believe a lot in that. \r\nAnother thing is that we have very little donation to social enterprises that can promote profitability. But we use our critical mass to mobilize suppliers, to mobilize consumers, and to generate resources to causes that we believe are worthwhile. So last year, we collected BRL 3.3 million that were used to fund selected NGLs. So Raia has a social magazine, named Sorria, in which we reached revenues are fully -- our net of effective was a fully channeled to NGLs. So last year, we donated as a result of Sorria, BRL 1.7 million, mostly to the that both to GRAACC, which is a reference youth center for cancer in Brazil and for the Instituto Ayrton Senna. This is a foundation that manages education in underprivileged areas. And if you look since 2008, we have collected and donated more than BRL 12 million, and the book has been to GRAACC to fund a new hospital in São Paulo. So it's something that I think is very much in use.\r\nLeveraging the learning with the Raia social medicine and leveraging our capacity to multiply this initiative, we launched the Bem + magazine at Drogasil. So already in the first year, we collected and donated BRL 0.9 million to Obra do Berço. This is an NGO that assists needy families. And Drogasil has also had another program that we call solidary change, in which, we invite clients to round up import duties, and then we collect these extra amount. I mean, it's generally cents for each consumer, but BRL 0.7 million in total for the year. And we're donating that amount to AACD, which is an NGO specialized in assisting disabled children. Another thing is in environmental endeavor. I think the main program that we have in program concentrated at Raia is a conscient waste program, in which this is not mandatory by large, it's something that we do because we believe in. So we have to have 231 Raia stores that are fully equipped to receive pharma -- retail of medicines from consumers in the used medicines, either a method that won't be any use anymore, a method that had been expired or whatever. So we take these meds, we collect these medicines. We have collected 22 tonnage of residues last year, and then we disposed this waste correctly considering the best environmental practice possible. And our estimate is that we are preserving up to 9,000 liters of water that could have been contaminated by such waste. \r\nAnd finally, before passing to Marcílio, I think we had a very low share price by year-end. Our share price, we had a share price with [indiscernible] last year of nearly 36%, even below the IBOVESPA, as a consequence, I think, of our disappointing results. And also, as I mentioned, I think, of before investments in Brazil. And -- but already in the beginning of this year, we have -- our share price is now at something like 16.4. So we have a share increase year-to-date of 19% percent. \r\nAnd I think this is just the beginning to put the company back where it should be. I'm now backing to Marcílio to comment on our challenges for next year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Now let's go to the 40% in which are the challenge for 2014. I wish to highlight 2 very important determines [ph] in 2013, okay, the results of 2013. The first one is the concluded identification of our corporate fees as announced to finalize the conversion of all the stores which were migrated to our retail platform. We started to hold out that in September and the final storage of that conversion on February 28th during the current hold. We now have the 970 high end of those stores fully connected to our 7 DCs and at the very same retail platform and the very same financial and account system is together. This integration will help us and unify our corporate structure and profits and allow us to achieve leaner execution, in terms of savings and in value creation. \r\nThe second challenge for this year in my point of view is that we opened 131 new stores. We've been charged or being focused on the integration in 2014. We opened these new stores during the year, a high graded stores for high [indiscernible] Brazilian drug store industry. The special brands has allowed us to extend our presence in the markets in which we are the leaders like São Paulo and Goiânia and they increase our present in recent markets like Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul and Bahia. \r\nThe team and the intelligence that we had for strong developing are uniquely huge and it represented a huge competitive advantage in relation to our competitors. This has allowed us to leave the consolidation of our inventories, not knowing in terms of the number of the stores, but also regarding property, quality and expected returns.\r\nPlease let's go to Slide 18, and this slide just tells the challenge for 2014, okay, and for many challenge in this year. The first challenge is sustainable growth and financial discipline. We think to open 130 new stores in the coming years with great financial discipline. We expect high margin with them and cash flows to generations just like 2013. \r\nAs predicted, mature market increases year-after-year, we are about balancing stores in these markets which lead to new states. Specifically Northeast that you go with more stores in this year. We also focused new formats not only from this new still private stage, but also it's different for Raia and Drograsil, including both corporate stores or large formats in small markets or in big markets also. \r\nThe second challenge will be the productivity gains. With the integration of the corporate systems and the beginning of the identification of this checkout business, we will review our store processes to inspire our activities and to increase opportunities and to set the standards to our customers. The strength in margin expansion we expect to change on a controlling, selling expenses in the scenario of inflation. Our focus will be on initiatives that promotes in our strong growth above inflation, and their reduced selling expense without jeopardizing the sales job for our customers. At the corporate level, we intend to identify the cost of administrative expense and the increasing gross margin to category management and deeper penetration of the private label and generics. \r\nOur third challenge for us in 2014 would be increasing the omni-channel position. We are one of the leader in Brazil in telesales and e-commerce, but we are still operate [indiscernible]. We know the importance of integrating of omni-channel platform to enhance the shop experience of our customers. [indiscernible] in the medium term, but we're already moving in that direction. \r\nIn 2013, we defined our sales and e-commerce with Droga Raia a single sales standard brand in the value, drogaraia.com. And in December, we launched [indiscernible] to our website. \r\nFurthermore, we unified the full range for both brands into a single site. And we will upgrade your IT system tool in 2014, creating the basis for all the region and the basis for the growth for the next few years. \r\nAnd therefore, our next challenge will be alignment and retention, implementing 2013 a compensation program basically on overall goals for the company of our each individual executive. We think we [indiscernible] fixed shares that is approached by our large contribution, but to the general shareholders. [indiscernible] to retain our key talents. Now we can move to the questions. Thank you very much.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Marcílio Pousada (Executives)】\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to the Raia Drogasil results presentation for the fourth quarter of 2013. As always, Eugenio will present the highlights of the year. And just before to Q&A, I would like to discuss a few points about 2013, and our challenges for 2014. Eugenio, please?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Eugenio De Zagottis (Executives)】\nHello, everybody. Thank you for attending the conference call. To start with, I'd like to give an overview for the year. \r\nWe believe 2013 was a year full of contrasts. It was a very disappointing year in terms of financial results. We -- this was a year we were definitely not happy about. But at same time, it was a year of significant breakthroughs, towards building the vision that we had at the time of the merger for the company. As we have significant advances in our integration, as we have -- as we're preparing the company for a new leap in execution, for a leap in service in terms of consumers, and for a leap in creating value for our shareholders. \r\nWe opened in the year 967 stores -- sorry, we ended the year with 967 stores. We opened a total of 131 stores, which is a national record, not only for the company, but for the Brazilian drug store sector and maybe for the Brazilian retail sector at large, we're not sure about that, but at least I haven't seen any reference for an opening pace like this. We have also closed 24 stores as part of our closure program, that has already been concluded, and that's our closure program that we had intended to do and has communicated and foresees high [indiscernible] together.\r\nWe've gained BRL 6.5 billion revenues last year. We grew 15.6% with 9.3% of same-store sales. It's very important to highlight that we had added in the year BRL 0.9 billion, even during the [indiscernible]. So we added fully organically, our mass of revenues equivalent for the eighth largest drug supplier in Brazil, so it's very significant. \r\nWe recorded an EBITDA of BRL 357 million, a margin of 5.5%, and an increase of 9.6%. So as I mentioned, we lost 0.2 percentage points in EBITDA margin versus the previous year as a result of mature stores not growing in line as inflation, and as a result of the loss of operating leverage that we had at our start. \r\nNet income on an adjusted basis totaled BRL 176 million, with a net margin of 2.7%. And one of the highlights of the year was the fact that we've generated positive free cash flow of BRL 45 million, in spite of the weaker results in the year, and in spite of a very strong investment program undertook last year. And even when you consider interests, interest on own capital, we still posted a positive BRL 22 million in total cash flow generation. So cash sustainability, something very important for us and it's something that we believe to keep posting from now on. \r\nOn Page 4, talking about our growth. As we mentioned, we opened 131 stores. We closed 24 stores and we suspended 4 stores during the year. Suspensions means stores that are temporarily closed for rebranding, generally from RaiaDrogasil to Farmasil, but sometimes even from Raia to Drogasil or vice versa. \r\nThe 24 closures that we had, they have been part of our synergy program announced since the time of the merger. If you consider the last 2 years, we closed a total of 37 stores in the program. But it's important to highlight that a very small number of stores that we have closed in this period is related to store development mistakes in the recent years. \r\nOnly 12 stores of the 37 has been open since 2010. \r\nSo we talk about, in average, we had 6 stores per year that we can consider mistakes in our investment program. And this is a reasonable pace closing 5, 6 stores per year, and this is what we expect for 2014. But the other 25 stores have been legacy stores that have been closed due to the portfolio optimization that we did. So we have very often 2 stores that were subpar stores even if positive, they were side by side. So we have significant opportunities to close more stores to migrate revenues to the surviving store, and to end up with 1 good store, instead of 2 dead stores. \r\nThe program has been concluded now, and from now on, we still close stores, but that's part of the normal life, and we expect a rate of 5, 6, 7 per year, not more than that. \r\nBy the year end, the each structure infrastructure of our portfolio includes a 33% stores still undergoing mature changes. So these are stores that are not generating their full potential, and as the stores mature they will become a significant lever of profitability for the company. \r\nPage 5. We did not enter in many new markets last year. So we stayed in the same store markets that we had before. That account for nearly 83% of the Brazilian pharmaceutical markets. So it's a very broad geographic presence. Out of the 967 stores had by year end, 495 were Drogasil or Farmasil. So another subline of the [indiscernible]. We had classified as Drogasil. When we achieve our record scale, we can start separating Farmasil, but as of now, we don't think it's worth. For Raia 472 stores in total.\r\nWe are publishing comparable market shares. This is the market share, excluding newly formed and added to IMS panel during the year. So we had on a comparable market share growth, over 0.3 percentage points from 9.4% to 9.7% at a national level. We posted a slight margin loss in São Paulo 0.1 percentage point. I would like the margin gain in the Southeast. We should not include São Paulo, so the Southeast is basically, [indiscernible], Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro, and than a strong gains in the Midwest, in the South and the Northeast. \r\nIf you consider the new stores not open, the new informants added to the base during the year. We've are now at historical comparability, we're going to add the last year 9.4% of share. But we cannot compare that figure with the previous year, because it's 2 different base of informants. The comparable number is 0.2% on national overall. \r\nOn Page 6, we discussed our revenue  growth for the year. Last year was a challenging year in terms of sales by any means. We grew 15% over the whole year, and it's important to mention that the closing and suspension of stores impacted our numbers by 1.2 percentage points. So we would have 16.8% not considering the stores that will close or suspended. We ended the fourth quarter already in a much better pace of 17.5% growth. Same-store sales grew 11.6% -- grew 9.3% for the year, but in the fourth quarter, you already 11.9%, which is a good number. And for a mature stores, 4.7% for the whole year versus 6.0% for the fourth quarter. So we ended the year with our stores in line with inflation. And this was very important for us, and this is something that happened that helped a lot in the fourth quarter numbers. And that had a positive trend for mature store growth above inflation for 2014. We probably start in the first quarter already. \r\nTalking about our product mix, the highlight of the year was OTC. We benefited from shifting OTC exposure -- product exposure from behind the counter to the front store at higher, and as the Brazilian stores that we progressively renovated. We have also brought OTC to the front stores. So this has helped. All the category we feel like [indiscernible]. This is a very important category, it's a category that have not been well developed by our suppliers. But last year, we had a great year in vitamins where we were the market leader, which is several launch of several new items. We improved this execution. Our private label also helped and the 2 brands they pushed the whole category. So what you see was a very good number. \r\nGeneric has been challenging and we don't deny that. Over the full year, we lost 0.2 percentage points. And the fourth quarter was particularly very challenging with 11, only 11.2% of penetration for generics. What happened here is that we are swimming upstream. So what happens here is that we haven't had any new generics launched. So our whole improvement now depends on our execution. We wanted to at least maintain generic offer not growing based on improved mix in execution of generics. I think the [indiscernible] of Drogasil will be instrumental to push generics penetration and even at Raia we have things that we can do to better deliver generics penetration. \r\nOn Page 8, let's discuss our gross margins for the year and our cash cycle. We increased gross margins 0.1, so pretty much in line over the previous year. But when we look at the fourth quarter, we've seen 0.4 percentage point gross margin contradiction. There's nothing wrong with the fourth quarter of this year. What happened is that the fourth quarter of last year was very, very high, by any means a big number. Both numbers are fully comparable because the tax impacts that we had due to the new tax regime that we adopted during the whole 2013, it happened before that. So in both quarters, both the fourth quarter '12 and '13, that we have a full comparable base. But the fourth quarter '12, came after a very weak 3 quarter '12, where we had grown only -- only had a gross margin of only 26.2%. So probably, we had the higher -- the high concentration of trade allowances in the fourth quarter as it pushed the third quarter of last year. When we consider 26.7%, this is absolutely in line with the performance of our -- that we had in every nonseasonal quarter last year. So we had 26.8% in the third quarter. We had 26.6% in the fourth quarter. The second quarter was not very high, but this is a seasonable -- our seasonal quarter in which followed by an inflationary gains on events generally produces very high margin levels. \r\nLast year, we've given sales that way as we don't do any forward buying, and as we had a change in purchasing model that ends the benefit from the [indiscernible]. But when you compare the fourth quarter with every nonseasonal quarter last year, it was pretty much in line. So this is not -- there is nothing wrong here. And we've now -- in December, we left the previous tax regime, and we're back to the tax substitution regime. This will help our margin by approximately 0.4 percentage points. And we believe, we'll see the whole margin improvement booked in already in the second quarter of the year, after the whole inventory has been rotated. And other important feature to explain here is that, as we got back to the tax substitution execution, which is a much better -- achieved on gross margins. We have a penalty impact cycle because at end of the tax execution regime, we buy all of the merchandises. This was tax already pre-collected by our suppliers. \r\nWhile in the regime that we just opted out from, we used to pay taxes only when we transferred items from the DCs to the stores. So to answer there is tax regime, we had to pay taxes on inventory. So basically inventory accounts and we paid the taxes to the state on those inventors. These taxes or advantages represent BRL 4.1 billion of cash cycle that we boost already in the fourth quarter of the year. \r\nSo when you look at the cash cycle. Even though, it looks like we've already improved BRL 1.1 days. The reality is that on a comparable basis, taking out the tax effect, we will have a cash cycle improvement of 5.9 days, this is very, very significant. And this has been boosted by our very important inventory levels that should as we pursued over the whole 2013. \r\nIn the fourth quarter, we ended with 84.8 days of inventories, and an improvement of 1.5 days of inventories, even considering that our cash cycle increased by 4.1 days, as a consequence of the adoption on the tax substitution. So if you don't consider that, then we have a very strong inventory reserves. Shown on a comparable basis, inventory went down significantly, cash cycle went down significantly in such a way that is absorbed the tax penalty. So that to get back to the new tax regime, and if you allow a small 1 day -- 1.8 day gains to subsidies.\r\nAnother important thing to highlight here is that as we had decreased opportunities, especially in generics, over the whole year, over the most of the year, after we paid the last outstanding devices in the second and third quarters specifically, our cash cycle was penalized by a very low base of accounts payable. Now as we are now -- after reducing inventory we are now replenishing. Normally, our accounts payable had got back to where they should be. So this help show the effect of the inventory that was previously offset by transitory penalty accounts payable. \r\nOn Page 9, talking about sales expenses. Our sales expenses increased 0.7% -- percentage points in the year. So out of the increase, 0.3% was payroll increases, 0.2% was rentals and 0.2% was marketing. And something that's important to mention here remains in our reach margins went up by 0.3 -- 0.2 was a choice that we made, it was the market investment that we made. The point here is that our immediate horizon is not the quarter and it's not the year. We do whatever it takes to be successful in the middle-term in the longer-term. These markets investments certainly did not pay off last year. But it's very important and it pays off over a longer term. So, whenever, we have to pick a choice, of posting beautiful numbers or of doing what's right, we do what's right. And this is I think a very, very good example of that. \r\nWhen you look at the fourth quarter, we had now flat sales expenses performance, which, I think -- which we deal as a victory. Maintaining sales performance, sales expense is flat. In an inflationary environment, we think, it's a very good number. And the main reasons on, why we have been able to do that in the fourth quarter is: first, better expense control; second, to stop closures are helping because we took off the less productive stores; and third, we are seeing a better sales environment. And as a result, we're achieving better revenues. People think of sales expenses as variable, but they are not variable. Payroll and rent are fixed. When the revenues are good, dilution is good, when revenues are down, dilution doesn't happen. \r\nSo the sales performance is dependent on sales expenses. \r\nNext page, G&A. We have been very successful in diluting G&A. Ever since the merger of RaiaDrogasil, we have maintained the quarter generic constant inflation and inflation-adjusted terms. So the total number of G&A has increased only by inflation ever since our merger. While the number of stores that we have simplified, decreased by 20%. As a result of the dilution, we saw last year a 0.3 percentage point dilution in G&A, both in the year and in the fourth quarter. And we expect to keep diluting G&A in 2014 and maybe 2015. \r\nAs a result, we had a 0.3 percentage points pressure in the annual EBITDA. As I mentioned previously, with the sales scenario, we know each mature stores grew below inflation and at a loss of operating leverage. And we also saw a recovery in the fourth quarter by maintaining for the first time in the year, the same margins of the previous year. \r\nSomething that we highlight here, is the impact of the stores open in the calendar year over the fourth quarter performance. So we started -- we had in the fourth quarter of the year 836 stores that had -- that were already in operation in December of 2012. \r\nSo in 2012, by year end, we had reached even a higher number of stores, but then we closed some. So 836 at the existing stores that were in operation ever since the end of the fourth quarter. So these stores are low not considering these new stores that have been excluding year, they posted in the quarter BRL 1.6 billion gross revenues, BRL 104 million of EBITDA, full absorbing corporate G&A and logistics and then they posted 6.4% of EBITDA in the fourth quarter over a higher -- sorry, slightly lower revenue base. So these highlights, the impact of the new stores and our profitability. Whenever you look at valuation and if you forget that we have opened a lot of recent stores that are still generating managing productivity. But we create value over their maturation term. I think, it's important to consider that to see the whole picture. \r\nPage 12, depreciation increased 0.3 percentage points in the year due to the acceleration in our investment program, and increased 0.2 percentage points in the fourth quarter. Financial expenses also increased 0.2 in the year, as we maintained the year, an average net debt higher than the previous year. But as the net debt includes significant in the fourth quarter, we maintained a constant net financial expenses of 0.1 percentage points. Then taxes that includes significantly as we have goodwill amortization. So 0.7 percentage points increase an improvement over the previous year. When we compare the fourth quarter, we're comparing a quarter in which we had goodwill -- taxes from goodwill over the whole quarter this year. First of the quarter in 2012 I think, only in December, we had got good goodwill, the tax shield on goodwill. So it's not fully comparable, but it helped increase adjusted profitability by 0.6 percentage points in the fourth quarter. \r\nAnd as a result, we had a slight net income increase of 0.1 percentage points on an adjusted basis, and a 0.4 percentage points increase in the fourth quarter. \r\nPage 14, I would like to give a lot of emphasis on nonrecurring expenses. We are in the mid of a significant change program due to the integration of RaiaDrogasil, We have got significant advances in the end of 2013. And in the beginning of 2014, we had finished the corporate integration and we have, we are paving the way now for in-store [ph] check up seasonally Marcílio will cover that into a higher level detail. But what happens here is that we don't expect the level of change we're affecting without nonrecurring expenses. And we give you full disclosure of nonrecurring expenses. So that any investor can understand it, and consider it in any way that you see fit. So we think over the full year BRL 48.5 million in nonrecurring expenses. It's a high number, we know it, but it's the cost of doing the integration into the company that we are building. In the fourth quarter alone it was BRL 14.5 million. The point I would like to stress here is that, already from the first quarter of 2014, we see already a core reduction in nonrecurring expenses, and for various reasons. \r\nLast year, we spent BRL 15.5 million in store closures. This is basically noncash asset writeoffs, but we've few expenses. Now, the store closures will be 0 because even though, will be closing couple of stores, 5, 6 stores there will be part of the recurring profitability in the company. The program is over. The program is successfully concluded. So already in January, when you look at our nonrecurring expenses, you'll see 0 in store closures. As a matter of fact, same store, we have BRL 13.3 million in the year. We subsidized the stores that lost their licenses incorporation over the years that we recovered the licenses those expense started last year, with BRL 5.5 million in the first quarter, and drop significantly into BRL 1.8 million in the last quarter. And now you have 0 for the first quarter of '14, as every single or regional store that is already fully relicensed up and running the program. \r\nSeverance expenses. We had BRL 9.1 million severance expenses. We had changes in the management structure of the company. We had restructurings and people leaving the company. And in the fourth quarter, you can see an increase in severance of BRL 4.4 million. What happens here is that we have -- we still have some severance expense for next year. But we have  reason to those expenses in the fourth quarter. So as we're using the provision for next year, we will also book zero nonrecurring expenses, as far as our severance expense. And finally, we book last year BRL 7.1 million in consulting expenses. We still have consulting expenses, but to a lesser degree. \r\nSo nonrecurring expenses will not be 0, especially in the first quarter consulting expenses would be existent because we had support of consultants to conclude the corporate integration. We still have some level of consulting taking place to support us in integration, but a much lower expense item. So I think, nonrecurring expenses from next year will be a very, very low number. \r\nOn Page 15, I'd like to give more color on our free cash flow, which I think was one of the highlight of the year. We generated an operating cash flow of BRL 282 million in the year, already considering working capital. We invested a significant amount of BRL 236.8 million that we had in the year. Not only, we opened 131 stores, but we have also accelerated renovation of new stores -- of existing stores, especially, [indiscernible]. So we had a free cash flow of BRL 45 million, I mean, actually, this is significant. We take a year in nearly we invested BRL 236 million, a year in which our performance was deteriorated, and we lost operating margins to BRL 45 million of free cash flow. I think, this is an achievement. And then due to this amount was given sufficient to pay interest on our equity on our cash basis and of BRL 29 million, to pay net financial expenses, net of the respective taxes, and  to post a total cash flow of BRL 22 million in the year. \r\nOn Page 16, this is something, we don't talk much, but I think, it's sorry -- but I think, it's important to highlight. I mean, we want to add even before the merger, we had a very significant commitment to sustainability to the group of bottom line. I think, we had a very strong social inclusion programs and social mobilization programs, I mean that our momentum initiatives lastly. We have not shed enough light on the in the past. I think, it's important to disclose or discuss what we're doing. We have a model social inclusion project in Brazil. We employ more than 900 handicapped employees as part of the side-by-side project, and they're fully located -- fully deployed over store. We're not the only company in Brazil to have handicapped people. This is even a legal requirement. The difference is that we're not hiding our people in the distribution centers, in call centers, we are putting them in stores where their social inclusion is full in which the clients see what they'll do and appreciate, what we're doing. So this is something, we believe a lot in that. \r\nAnother thing is that we have very little donation to social enterprises that can promote profitability. But we use our critical mass to mobilize suppliers, to mobilize consumers, and to generate resources to causes that we believe are worthwhile. So last year, we collected BRL 3.3 million that were used to fund selected NGLs. So Raia has a social magazine, named Sorria, in which we reached revenues are fully -- our net of effective was a fully channeled to NGLs. So last year, we donated as a result of Sorria, BRL 1.7 million, mostly to the that both to GRAACC, which is a reference youth center for cancer in Brazil and for the Instituto Ayrton Senna. This is a foundation that manages education in underprivileged areas. And if you look since 2008, we have collected and donated more than BRL 12 million, and the book has been to GRAACC to fund a new hospital in São Paulo. So it's something that I think is very much in use.\r\nLeveraging the learning with the Raia social medicine and leveraging our capacity to multiply this initiative, we launched the Bem + magazine at Drogasil. So already in the first year, we collected and donated BRL 0.9 million to Obra do Berço. This is an NGO that assists needy families. And Drogasil has also had another program that we call solidary change, in which, we invite clients to round up import duties, and then we collect these extra amount. I mean, it's generally cents for each consumer, but BRL 0.7 million in total for the year. And we're donating that amount to AACD, which is an NGO specialized in assisting disabled children. Another thing is in environmental endeavor. I think the main program that we have in program concentrated at Raia is a conscient waste program, in which this is not mandatory by large, it's something that we do because we believe in. So we have to have 231 Raia stores that are fully equipped to receive pharma -- retail of medicines from consumers in the used medicines, either a method that won't be any use anymore, a method that had been expired or whatever. So we take these meds, we collect these medicines. We have collected 22 tonnage of residues last year, and then we disposed this waste correctly considering the best environmental practice possible. And our estimate is that we are preserving up to 9,000 liters of water that could have been contaminated by such waste. \r\nAnd finally, before passing to Marcílio, I think we had a very low share price by year-end. Our share price, we had a share price with [indiscernible] last year of nearly 36%, even below the IBOVESPA, as a consequence, I think, of our disappointing results. And also, as I mentioned, I think, of before investments in Brazil. And -- but already in the beginning of this year, we have -- our share price is now at something like 16.4. So we have a share increase year-to-date of 19% percent. \r\nAnd I think this is just the beginning to put the company back where it should be. I'm now backing to Marcílio to comment on our challenges for next year.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Marcílio Pousada (Executives)】\nOkay. Now let's go to the 40% in which are the challenge for 2014. I wish to highlight 2 very important determines [ph] in 2013, okay, the results of 2013. The first one is the concluded identification of our corporate fees as announced to finalize the conversion of all the stores which were migrated to our retail platform. We started to hold out that in September and the final storage of that conversion on February 28th during the current hold. We now have the 970 high end of those stores fully connected to our 7 DCs and at the very same retail platform and the very same financial and account system is together. This integration will help us and unify our corporate structure and profits and allow us to achieve leaner execution, in terms of savings and in value creation. \r\nThe second challenge for this year in my point of view is that we opened 131 new stores. We've been charged or being focused on the integration in 2014. We opened these new stores during the year, a high graded stores for high [indiscernible] Brazilian drug store industry. The special brands has allowed us to extend our presence in the markets in which we are the leaders like São Paulo and Goiânia and they increase our present in recent markets like Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul and Bahia. \r\nThe team and the intelligence that we had for strong developing are uniquely huge and it represented a huge competitive advantage in relation to our competitors. This has allowed us to leave the consolidation of our inventories, not knowing in terms of the number of the stores, but also regarding property, quality and expected returns.\r\nPlease let's go to Slide 18, and this slide just tells the challenge for 2014, okay, and for many challenge in this year. The first challenge is sustainable growth and financial discipline. We think to open 130 new stores in the coming years with great financial discipline. We expect high margin with them and cash flows to generations just like 2013. \r\nAs predicted, mature market increases year-after-year, we are about balancing stores in these markets which lead to new states. Specifically Northeast that you go with more stores in this year. We also focused new formats not only from this new still private stage, but also it's different for Raia and Drograsil, including both corporate stores or large formats in small markets or in big markets also. \r\nThe second challenge will be the productivity gains. With the integration of the corporate systems and the beginning of the identification of this checkout business, we will review our store processes to inspire our activities and to increase opportunities and to set the standards to our customers. The strength in margin expansion we expect to change on a controlling, selling expenses in the scenario of inflation. Our focus will be on initiatives that promotes in our strong growth above inflation, and their reduced selling expense without jeopardizing the sales job for our customers. At the corporate level, we intend to identify the cost of administrative expense and the increasing gross margin to category management and deeper penetration of the private label and generics. \r\nOur third challenge for us in 2014 would be increasing the omni-channel position. We are one of the leader in Brazil in telesales and e-commerce, but we are still operate [indiscernible]. We know the importance of integrating of omni-channel platform to enhance the shop experience of our customers. [indiscernible] in the medium term, but we're already moving in that direction. \r\nIn 2013, we defined our sales and e-commerce with Droga Raia a single sales standard brand in the value, drogaraia.com. And in December, we launched [indiscernible] to our website. \r\nFurthermore, we unified the full range for both brands into a single site. And we will upgrade your IT system tool in 2014, creating the basis for all the region and the basis for the growth for the next few years. \r\nAnd therefore, our next challenge will be alignment and retention, implementing 2013 a compensation program basically on overall goals for the company of our each individual executive. We think we [indiscernible] fixed shares that is approached by our large contribution, but to the general shareholders. [indiscernible] to retain our key talents. Now we can move to the questions. Thank you very much.",
      "transcript_text3": "This is actually Villame [ph]. My question is, I'd like to have some color on the remodeling plan for the Drogasil stores. Can you tell us a little bit about how many stores you have already remodeled and how many more you're planning on remodeling this year, and then about the schedule of the remodeling. That's one question. And I have also a second question, which is regarding the system integration. I would like to understand that for a checkout system that you said could be done by the end of this year. I'd to understand a little bit more about what will be the potential gains that you expect from the integration of the checkout system? Those are my questions.\n\n---\n\nVillame [ph], thank you for the questions. I don't have here the connect number of stores that we opened last year that, sorry, that we renovated last year. Since the merger until let's say the middle of last year, the focus of renovation was higher. We have the several higher that were run down stores. We don't have Drogasil stores that are run down. The kind of intervention that we are doing is functional. We're changing the store layout. And we're pretty much doing, let's say, a category management shock at the stores. We are changing layouts, we are bringing projects, OTC projects from the pharmacy part to the front store. We're organizing that as the categories amongst stores. And we are moving the checkouts from the front of the stores to the side, and this opens more space for selling gondola and so on. Ever since the second -- or whatever we did in the second semester of this year onward was pretty much Drogasil. And we still have a very strong program for this year. There'll be Raia stores as well, but the focus is Drogasil. Another thing to mention is that for at least a year, we have been opening Drogasil the correct format. So probably, when we finish this year, I would say, the 1/3 into 40% of the Drogasil stores are already fully renovated. And because of the starting with the main store's goal, they have higher potentials. They set up ahead to the situation. So 40% of the stores, we mean 60% of the potential and something like that. So this is progressing very well. We start to see improvements in Drogasil. We have it, as a total for the company, a better first quarter in terms of revenues is slightly ahead of inflation for much of the stores. And we're going to assume that it's still below inflation, but we are moving in the right direction. We have the whole first semester where Raia will be posting very strong numbers, carry good momentum from this year over a weaker comp base. \r\nIn the second semester, Raia will face a high comp and Raia will probably be down a couple of basis points in mature store growth. At that point, we need Drogasil to do the magic, to fill the void of this potential reduction in the Raia growth. So -- but it's too early, in which we believe Raia will be doing very well over the year, and Drogasil will probably end well the year. But if Drogasil will add inflation even finally above the second semester, this is a number we can deal with Since Raia will be doing well and then positioning 2015, where both brands should be doing well. This is an industry in which the cycle is long. I mean, all the mistakes that we do, they don't harm us the next phase. They take a while to show the effect, and likewise. I mean, when we do things like when we focus on execution and when we bring the company to a new momentum in terms of store execution, this takes also a couple of quarters, too, much or less. But we're comfortable with what we've seen. And also, we are going in the right direction. \r\nSystem integration is something that's also very important. I mean, in the current stage in which all the corporate systems are unified, what happened with that first, we can unify the whole corporate structure in the back office and unify the processes in the back office. So there's some savings, some increase of productivity in the back office that we achieve. But much more important with that is that we are the execution of the stores, especially Drogasil, starts getting better. For example, the sale store [ph] that we have at the pharmacy counter, now this is an almost a satellite of our corporate retail system. So although the system, the same system in Drogasil, all 100% of Drogasil stores are ready is a much better face system. In which of our staff has the full information required to make sales on, let's say, U.S. for a specific Droga product. We know if the product is on pharmacy [indiscernible] or not. And if it is, you're probably thinking of free or very little copay. We know if the Droga product has a generic, how much it costs, and you can choose another generic. We know if the products follow a manufacture program with this much a discount if we have a partnership with a health insurance company that will -- to reach the opportunity to be affiliated. So there are a lot of executions, I think, that we're ready doing better at the store as a function of this integration. It takes a while to mature alike, people getting used to with the new systems. And as I mentioned that we start to have full flexibility on pricing, the Drograsil and the previous decision was very limited in terms of pricing. So we can now work pricing now much more effectively. It doesn't mean that a market will be up or down because of that, but let's say that the promotions we currently have will be better distributed across drugs and across products. So this is where we are. As we finalize the integration of the checkout systems, then we start gaining in terms of CRM and more advanced promotional features that we still cannot access at Drograsil. \r\nJust to clarify, Villame [ph], we did last year 175 renovations. I think the growth of these were in the cost of the -- with the bulk of these were Drogasil. And this year, we expect to do 216 stores and they'll be seeing a number of Raia renovation as well. But the majority will be Drogasil. And the renovation part is located -- almost this number every year to renovate, just not only this year, okay?\n\n---\n\nOkay. And are you concentrating on any specific quarter of the year or you're trying to do the 216 stores throughout the year. How is this schedule looking like, Eugene?\n\n---\n\nWhen we are starting for the renovation with the top stores, and especially the stores in São Paulo. So it's a combination of service-oriented stores. I mean, no doubt that when you had a format issue, it makes much of a difference with a more sophisticated [indiscernible] mix with a more price-oriented consumer with a less HPC-driven consumer. So we are starting mostly not only in São Paulo, and we're starting with the top stores and then we're moving down the scale. That should be next year.\n\n---\n\nI've got a couple of questions. The first one is just about the same-store sales and mature stores and whether you can give us an idea of what's happening so far in the first quarter. I mean, we should see an improvement given the weak comp. So should we be looking at something around 8% or 9%? \r\nAnd then the second thing, just in the fourth quarter, how did you manage to improve the payroll as a percentage of sales after you agreed such a large wage settled in São Paulo?\n\n---\n\nRichard, thank you for the questions. We are seeing a better scenario in mature stores in the first quarter. We had a very strong January, but probably a month that is not represented of the full year because the weather was very dry and very hot in a month that's generally rainy. So January will help, but January will -- is not multiplied itself over the rest of the year. When we see February and March, we had a good weather. We are happy with what we see, not as high as January, but we are above inflation. So we should have our first quarter mature store number ahead of inflation better than the fourth quarter. So things are happening pretty well. You've said something correctly that we were able to have some dilution in payroll expenses in the fourth quarter. I think what happens here is the combination of better control would be more effective with that and better revenues. I mean, people think of sales expenses as variable expenses, when indeed they are fixed expenses. Rentals are fixed. You can sell 0 or BRL 2 million in the store then still pay the same rentals agreed by contract. And the number of employees, because they are in need of a regular flexibility, regular latitude in changing that because we'd have to cover long shifts. A lot of stores open 8 to midnight or the stores are 24/7. So we need to have a pharmacist full time in the store, and we have store managers and also system managers. So -- and we do have -- we don't have commissions, we have some variable compensation. But it's not that big in the store level. So through the end, the most important thing is basically to have a good sales performance. So the combination of a better sales performance with somewhere in terms of headcount. And the reality is that I think the comp base of 2012 was probably very high in terms of people. So over the year, we're able to improve our control in the payroll, but having cost and payroll is not something that is sustainable for the longer term. When you look at longer-term, payroll will be always fighting part of our results. Rental is a different story. We already see an improvement in rental in the fourth quarter versus the whole year. And I think this is probably sustainable because what happened is that the property market has peaked for some -- for quite some time. So when we are renewing contracts, of course, we're bringing contracts that were below-market to the market level. But each year that we do that, the increase is smaller than it was in the previous year. So I don't know if there were quite a decent math to that to get to that conclusion, but we get the sense that rent expenses is still pressuring, but the pressure is easing out. So we said it was 0.2 that we saw over the year. We saw 0.1 in the fourth quarter. Let's see if we'll maintain the number, but these are very encouraging number. And then the whole plan of the year is tying sale expenses a victory. I don't know if you can tie sales expenses next year. But at least we have total expenses in line or diluted and then the gross margin improvement plus whatever stays in terms of sales expense improvement because sales expenses are a challenge, but G&A improves the total should be in line or slightly better. So the combination of some such surplus on the expense side plus gross margin improvement should translate on better profitability next year.\n\n---\n\nCan I just have a follow-up on the gross margin? First of all, just at the end, you said you're expecting that to improve in 2014. Is that mainly you focusing on generics and trying to improve conversion of that stores? And then just a second thing, the comments that you made about the gross margin for the fourth quarter, you said that fell slightly because of a high base from the previous year. But in 2012, I was under the impression that most of the improvement came from synergies. So have you have to reinvest some of that improvement? Just a bit more color about the gross margin for the fourth quarter, if you can?\n\n---\n\nGreat. Thanks, Richard. No, the gross margin synergy, it happened in the beginning of the fourth quarter. So the fourth quarter -- sorry, let me rephrase. The purchasing improvement story happened a lot in the beginning of the year, but the fourth quarter 2012 has even comparing to other quarters was a very high quarter. We had 26.2% in the third quarter of the year, and then we had 27.1% in the fourth quarter of the year. Both the third quarter and the fourth quarter were affected by the tax situation. But certainly, what happened is that we probably had a higher concentration of trade allowances in the fourth Q '12, as well as through the third Q '12. Our gross margin is not seasonal. The only seasonal quarter is the second quarter. The second quarter is not comparable with any other quarter. But the remaining quarters, they are comparable among themselves. And we've seen the fourth quarter, the gross margin is absolutely in line with that of the third quarter and that of the first quarter of the year. So I think that the gross margin of the quarter represent where we are. And certainly, we now benefit as we get back to build the tax regime. And as in the second quarter, we'll have a margin improvement coming from a better tax situation. So this is one of the drivers for margin expansion. I think virtually it can be another driver, we will see, but we are not counting with generics because we have paying new generics. We are not seeing new generics being launched. We are seeing sometimes similar prescriptions that has been launched, to complete with the generics. So yes, we can execute better the generics, but in the current scenario, maintaining generics penetration, I think it's reasonable. So we should not be affected in our margin improvement. Margin improvement will come from certainly the reversal of the tax scenario and possibly some purchasing programs.\n\n---\n\nIt's Richard again. There's only a few questions so I will just ask one more, if you don't mind. Just again on the gross margin, can you just talk about how you're seeing competition, particularly in São Paulo. Are you seeing any change in the competitive environment, anybody being more aggressive on pricing? So like I said, particularly in São Paulo, but perhaps also in some other regions as well, so the South? And then what kind of experience you're having with the first few stores in the Northeast?\n\n---\n\nRichard, well, we have to acknowledge that I think we are now in a different market than we were before. Having said that, we don't have -- why we don't pressure all across the board. We have had localized pressures. For example, São Paulo -- not exactly in São Paulo. São Paulo is almost a profit sanctuary. We are both whereas in areas of São Paulo make a ton of money and nobody plays funny games. So São Paulo is a market that we haven't seen any differences, any changes in commercial policy. And this is a very, very important basis for us. Then I think the main difference in competitive scenario is different from what most people think. It's not the entrants of new competitors. We have seen new entrants in the industry, new entrants from abroad, new entrants from another industry, but these movements have been basically people buying assets. So it's existing assets under new ownership. The existing assets under new ownership is not added to competitive pressure. What is added competitive pressure is when we see competitors opening stores. We are seeing competitors increasing stores or competitors opening more stores. And so these openings have brought localized pressures here and there. We have margin pressures mainly in Goiânia, which a competitor is answering. We had margin pressures in Espirito Santo, but the good thing is that we have such a broad geographic presence that we can redeploy resources from markets where we don't have competitive pressures to other markets where sometimes we need to up the ante in terms of prices. We haven't seen up to now any disturbances in the south, I think, but we pressured all the people in the South as we open stores for the Catarina and the scale of Paraná. Any operation you need in the beginning to have lower gross margins, to build the breadth. And with time, margins are moving out. Already, we have a good level of margins in the south, both in Paraná and for the Catarina. So that's evolved into a movement. When you enter a new market, you have to do some of these operating investments. And that's part of the calculation toward achieving the returns that we aspire, that we have historically achieved. So I think we have only had regional pressures, and we have been able to compensate when market will falter. And we have been able to maintain gross margins even on a scenario of our added tax pressures. \r\nAnd then finally, I think this is not cutthroat market, this is a competitive market. I think a lot of people overestimate the importance of pricing in the competitive landscape. I think for the consumers we serve, we think, in the kind of stores that we operate, stores that have prime locations, stores that have easy parking and easy access, great purchase experience, service and so on. I think the hierarchy of choice for consumers is, first, location. So being the first in the best locations is something that absolutely makes a difference. The second is brand. Within the stores that are conveniently located, you choose the brands that you trust. If you're driving in São Paulo in a big traffic, in a big jam with security issues, you don't want to be stopping pharmacy after pharmacy. You pick the pharmacy you trust, but of course, that the brand is a promise of the execution. If you feel that you are not well-serviced, the prices were not honest and so on, you may move next time to a different player. But as far as we execute well, the consumers believe us. So price is part of execution, price is relevant, but prices are way, way, way less important that most investors think of.\n\n---\n\nWell, thank you all for attending our conference call. We are happy to leave 2013 behind, and to build upon the good staff or the good things that we're able -- the breakthrough that we're able to have in the year. So as we enter 2014, we are leveraging our significant progress in the system integration. We are leveraging our significant improvement in store execution from the renovations and from order initiatives. And we are -- I think we are very positive for the year. We registered better first quarter. It's still early to tell if the first quarter is better or in line of last year, but we don't expect it to be worse, for sure, maybe could be better. And I think in the second quarter, the difference should become self-evident. So thank you all for your support. And shareholders, we know that -- we knowledge that a lot of you had been through in the good and the bad days. And we're very happy to see that we're starting 2014 in much better shape, not only in terms of sales trends, but as a company in terms of management, in terms of execution focus that we were last year. And certainly, this effort will pay out. So thank you very much, and we're always here for visits, for your calls, whatever you need from us. Thanks.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nThis is actually Villame [ph]. My question is, I'd like to have some color on the remodeling plan for the Drogasil stores. Can you tell us a little bit about how many stores you have already remodeled and how many more you're planning on remodeling this year, and then about the schedule of the remodeling. That's one question. And I have also a second question, which is regarding the system integration. I would like to understand that for a checkout system that you said could be done by the end of this year. I'd to understand a little bit more about what will be the potential gains that you expect from the integration of the checkout system? Those are my questions.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Eugenio De Zagottis (Executives)】\nVillame [ph], thank you for the questions. I don't have here the connect number of stores that we opened last year that, sorry, that we renovated last year. Since the merger until let's say the middle of last year, the focus of renovation was higher. We have the several higher that were run down stores. We don't have Drogasil stores that are run down. The kind of intervention that we are doing is functional. We're changing the store layout. And we're pretty much doing, let's say, a category management shock at the stores. We are changing layouts, we are bringing projects, OTC projects from the pharmacy part to the front store. We're organizing that as the categories amongst stores. And we are moving the checkouts from the front of the stores to the side, and this opens more space for selling gondola and so on. Ever since the second -- or whatever we did in the second semester of this year onward was pretty much Drogasil. And we still have a very strong program for this year. There'll be Raia stores as well, but the focus is Drogasil. Another thing to mention is that for at least a year, we have been opening Drogasil the correct format. So probably, when we finish this year, I would say, the 1/3 into 40% of the Drogasil stores are already fully renovated. And because of the starting with the main store's goal, they have higher potentials. They set up ahead to the situation. So 40% of the stores, we mean 60% of the potential and something like that. So this is progressing very well. We start to see improvements in Drogasil. We have it, as a total for the company, a better first quarter in terms of revenues is slightly ahead of inflation for much of the stores. And we're going to assume that it's still below inflation, but we are moving in the right direction. We have the whole first semester where Raia will be posting very strong numbers, carry good momentum from this year over a weaker comp base. \r\nIn the second semester, Raia will face a high comp and Raia will probably be down a couple of basis points in mature store growth. At that point, we need Drogasil to do the magic, to fill the void of this potential reduction in the Raia growth. So -- but it's too early, in which we believe Raia will be doing very well over the year, and Drogasil will probably end well the year. But if Drogasil will add inflation even finally above the second semester, this is a number we can deal with Since Raia will be doing well and then positioning 2015, where both brands should be doing well. This is an industry in which the cycle is long. I mean, all the mistakes that we do, they don't harm us the next phase. They take a while to show the effect, and likewise. I mean, when we do things like when we focus on execution and when we bring the company to a new momentum in terms of store execution, this takes also a couple of quarters, too, much or less. But we're comfortable with what we've seen. And also, we are going in the right direction. \r\nSystem integration is something that's also very important. I mean, in the current stage in which all the corporate systems are unified, what happened with that first, we can unify the whole corporate structure in the back office and unify the processes in the back office. So there's some savings, some increase of productivity in the back office that we achieve. But much more important with that is that we are the execution of the stores, especially Drogasil, starts getting better. For example, the sale store [ph] that we have at the pharmacy counter, now this is an almost a satellite of our corporate retail system. So although the system, the same system in Drogasil, all 100% of Drogasil stores are ready is a much better face system. In which of our staff has the full information required to make sales on, let's say, U.S. for a specific Droga product. We know if the product is on pharmacy [indiscernible] or not. And if it is, you're probably thinking of free or very little copay. We know if the Droga product has a generic, how much it costs, and you can choose another generic. We know if the products follow a manufacture program with this much a discount if we have a partnership with a health insurance company that will -- to reach the opportunity to be affiliated. So there are a lot of executions, I think, that we're ready doing better at the store as a function of this integration. It takes a while to mature alike, people getting used to with the new systems. And as I mentioned that we start to have full flexibility on pricing, the Drograsil and the previous decision was very limited in terms of pricing. So we can now work pricing now much more effectively. It doesn't mean that a market will be up or down because of that, but let's say that the promotions we currently have will be better distributed across drugs and across products. So this is where we are. As we finalize the integration of the checkout systems, then we start gaining in terms of CRM and more advanced promotional features that we still cannot access at Drograsil. \r\nJust to clarify, Villame [ph], we did last year 175 renovations. I think the growth of these were in the cost of the -- with the bulk of these were Drogasil. And this year, we expect to do 216 stores and they'll be seeing a number of Raia renovation as well. But the majority will be Drogasil. And the renovation part is located -- almost this number every year to renovate, just not only this year, okay?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nOkay. And are you concentrating on any specific quarter of the year or you're trying to do the 216 stores throughout the year. How is this schedule looking like, Eugene?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Eugenio De Zagottis (Executives)】\nWhen we are starting for the renovation with the top stores, and especially the stores in São Paulo. So it's a combination of service-oriented stores. I mean, no doubt that when you had a format issue, it makes much of a difference with a more sophisticated [indiscernible] mix with a more price-oriented consumer with a less HPC-driven consumer. So we are starting mostly not only in São Paulo, and we're starting with the top stores and then we're moving down the scale. That should be next year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Cathcart (Analysts)】\nI've got a couple of questions. The first one is just about the same-store sales and mature stores and whether you can give us an idea of what's happening so far in the first quarter. I mean, we should see an improvement given the weak comp. So should we be looking at something around 8% or 9%? \r\nAnd then the second thing, just in the fourth quarter, how did you manage to improve the payroll as a percentage of sales after you agreed such a large wage settled in São Paulo?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Eugenio De Zagottis (Executives)】\nRichard, thank you for the questions. We are seeing a better scenario in mature stores in the first quarter. We had a very strong January, but probably a month that is not represented of the full year because the weather was very dry and very hot in a month that's generally rainy. So January will help, but January will -- is not multiplied itself over the rest of the year. When we see February and March, we had a good weather. We are happy with what we see, not as high as January, but we are above inflation. So we should have our first quarter mature store number ahead of inflation better than the fourth quarter. So things are happening pretty well. You've said something correctly that we were able to have some dilution in payroll expenses in the fourth quarter. I think what happens here is the combination of better control would be more effective with that and better revenues. I mean, people think of sales expenses as variable expenses, when indeed they are fixed expenses. Rentals are fixed. You can sell 0 or BRL 2 million in the store then still pay the same rentals agreed by contract. And the number of employees, because they are in need of a regular flexibility, regular latitude in changing that because we'd have to cover long shifts. A lot of stores open 8 to midnight or the stores are 24/7. So we need to have a pharmacist full time in the store, and we have store managers and also system managers. So -- and we do have -- we don't have commissions, we have some variable compensation. But it's not that big in the store level. So through the end, the most important thing is basically to have a good sales performance. So the combination of a better sales performance with somewhere in terms of headcount. And the reality is that I think the comp base of 2012 was probably very high in terms of people. So over the year, we're able to improve our control in the payroll, but having cost and payroll is not something that is sustainable for the longer term. When you look at longer-term, payroll will be always fighting part of our results. Rental is a different story. We already see an improvement in rental in the fourth quarter versus the whole year. And I think this is probably sustainable because what happened is that the property market has peaked for some -- for quite some time. So when we are renewing contracts, of course, we're bringing contracts that were below-market to the market level. But each year that we do that, the increase is smaller than it was in the previous year. So I don't know if there were quite a decent math to that to get to that conclusion, but we get the sense that rent expenses is still pressuring, but the pressure is easing out. So we said it was 0.2 that we saw over the year. We saw 0.1 in the fourth quarter. Let's see if we'll maintain the number, but these are very encouraging number. And then the whole plan of the year is tying sale expenses a victory. I don't know if you can tie sales expenses next year. But at least we have total expenses in line or diluted and then the gross margin improvement plus whatever stays in terms of sales expense improvement because sales expenses are a challenge, but G&A improves the total should be in line or slightly better. So the combination of some such surplus on the expense side plus gross margin improvement should translate on better profitability next year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Cathcart (Analysts)】\nCan I just have a follow-up on the gross margin?

These risks and uncertainties include: one, our ability to successfully implement our growth strategies, including executing contracts for new clients, enrolling children in our child care centers, retaining client contracts and operating profitably in the U.S. and abroad; second, our ability to identify, complete and successfully integrate acquisitions, and to realize attendant operating synergies; third, our decision to run capital investment and employee benefits that employers are making; fourth, our ability to hire and retain qualified teachers and other key employees and management; fifth, our substantial indebtedness and the terms of that indebtedness; and lastly, the variety of other risk factors which are set forth in our SEC filings.\r\nWe also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, and the detailed disclosures and reconciliations related to these measures are included in our press release, which is, as I mentioned, in the Investor Relations section of our website.\r\nLet me turn it back over to Dave to kick off the call.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Elizabeth, and hello, everybody, again. We're pleased to be talking with you today. Let me start with a review of Q4 and the full year 2013's operating results, and then I'll share our updated outlook and our plans for 2014. As usual, Elizabeth will follow me with a more detailed review of the numbers and then we'll both be together for Q&A afterwards.\r\nFirst, let me recap the quarter's headline numbers for you. Revenue of $317 million was up 17% over the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA of $53 million was up 13%. Adjusted net income more than doubled to $21 million, which yielded adjusted earnings per share of $0.32, up from $0.17 in last year's fourth quarter.\r\nFor the full year 2013, revenue totaled $1.2 billion, a 14% increase over 2012. Adjusted EBITDA of $209 million was up $28 million, or 15%, over last year and increased 20 basis points to 17.1% of revenue. Adjusted net income more than doubled to $78 million for the full year in 2013, and adjusted earnings per share for 2013 was $1.19 compared to $0.71 for 2012.\r\nDuring this past year, we continued to deliver on our long-term plan to grow our core center business both here in North America and in Europe, while at the same time expanding our newer lines of business. This past quarter, we added 9 new centers and overall through the year, we added 148 centers which increased our full-service capacity by 14%. Here in the U.S., we solidified our position as the leader in high-quality employer-sponsored child care with the acquisition of Children's Choice back in July.\r\nLooking back at the year, we added new centers for new clients across a variety of industry sectors, which were led by health care and biotech, higher education and energy. Some highlights for you for new center openings this past year included Biogen Idec, Weill Cornell Medical Center, The University of Virginia Medical Center, 2 sites for the University of Chicago, 3 sites for Inova Healthcare services and 2 locations for WellStar Health System. We also continued to expand our relationships with existing clients, opening additional centers for clients such as the University of California System, MIT here in Cambridge and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.\r\nOur strategy of developing new consortium locations continued to play out as well this past year with the addition of 17 new centers that opened across our network. We continue to execute on our strategy of expansion and market leadership in Europe, as well. In the U.K., with the acquisition of Kidsunlimited, a 64-center group in April; and in the Netherlands, with the opening of 5 new organic centers.\r\nOur back-up business also continued to show strength having grown 11% over the prior year with the addition of 43 new clients adopting this valuable service. Educational advising, our newest and smallest segment, grew 31% over the prior year as both existing Bright Horizons clients and new clients became convinced of the strong value proposition and the cost efficiencies we bring about for the considerable investments companies make in tuition reimbursement for their employees.\r\nWe also continued to close centers in 2013, just over 3% of total centers which is roughly in line with our anticipated plan for the year, and roughly in line with the same percentage we've experienced over the past few years. As a reminder, the primary sources of our center closings this past year were: one, client mergers and acquisitions, or internal reorganizations and the resulting consolidation of workforce locations; two, centers that were part of an acquired group that did not meet our performance thresholds, including 3 we closed this past quarter that were associated with the acquisitions we did this past year; and three, our usual discipline around pruning underperformers; and lastly, opportunistic relocations or consolidations of lease/consortium centers at lease renewal in order to maximize future results.\r\nOn the margin side, we continued our long-term track record to improve recurring income from operations again this past year, generating a 13% increase to $127 million in 2013. As we have previewed on our third quarter call, gross margins this past quarter were impacted by the headwinds from the acquisitions we completed earlier in the year, as well as the incremental losses from the larger class of lease/consortium centers that we opened in 2013, which in total was roughly $6 million more than we experienced in that same class in 2012.\r\nEven after the impact of these factors, we grew gross margins approximately 20 basis points to 23.1%. Perhaps the best news here is how well we're positioned for 2014 and beyond as we expect to leverage our investment in the larger classes of lease/consortium centers, and also realize the full value of the acquisitions we made this past year. I'll touch on that more later when we discuss our guidance for 2014.\r\nIn total for last year, the key factors in our gross margin performance included: first, tuition rate increases averaging 3% to 4% in our full-service segment; second, enrollment growth in our mature group which continued at 1% to 2% above prior year levels, as well as the ramp-up of our class of newer centers; third, new centers we added in 2013; and lastly, continued growth and margin improvement in our back-up business.\r\nAs I've just discussed before, offsetting these positive contributors in 2013 were center closings, the losses associated with a larger class of consortium models, and the impact during the integration of the 2 larger acquisitions we did this past year.\r\nWe also continue to remain very focused on closely managing and leveraging down our core SG&A spending. To that end, we achieved results slightly ahead of our plan and have leveraged overhead, excluding transaction-related costs by approximately 40 basis points in the fourth quarter. We're very pleased with the progress to date integrating our 2013 acquisitions and remain on track to complete that process in the first half of this year.\r\nSpeaking of this year, let me turn to 2014. Our plan for this year contemplates the addition of 50 to 55 new centers, approximately 30 net of expected closures, including new organic centers and some small tuck-in acquisitions. The organic new center growth will be achieved largely on the strength of our pipeline of centers currently under development and, as typical each year, transitions of management of centers that are either self-managed by the employer or managed by a competitor. Broadly speaking, the mix of centers in the pipeline is representative in size, geography and operating model of our existing base. With respect to industry mix, we continue to see good representation within higher education, technology, health care and energy with both new clients and new centers for existing clients in the pipeline.\r\nIn terms of our acquisition pipeline, we continue to review and evaluate a fairly steady stream of opportunities and expect that our track record of adding value in this area will continue in 2014. Our current outlook does not contemplate any larger scale acquisitions like those we completed this past year, but rather considers that for 2014 and beyond, roughly 1/3 of our new center growth will continue to come through the acquisition of smaller groups of high-quality centers and providers, both here in the U.S. and in Europe.\r\nAnother important piece of our story in 2014 and beyond will be the growth of our newer lines of business, led by our back-up dependent care services which we expect to grow and contribute to our margin expansion, once again, this year. One brief note on this segment as you look at this past quarter's growth rate, we're comping in this past quarter against a few unusual factors that incurred in the fourth quarter of 2012, the most significant of which was Hurricane Sandy, which produced a significant uplift in our back-up revenue that was nonrecurring as clients enlisted our help to provide some incremental services during that period of crisis. Thus the year-over-year growth rate we experienced in the fourth quarter is not our typical trend and we expect that going forward, our growth rate in this segment will return to our typical low teens pace.\r\nWe now serve more than 500 clients through our back-up care advantage program and continue to invest in the systems and operating structure that position us well to maintain our leadership in this market. We also remain encouraged by the interest in our educational advising services. New client additions in 2013 in this area included Liberty Mutual, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Shell and T. Rowe Price, and we now serve more than 110 clients, of which 40% also buy another Bright Horizons service. \r\nThe pipeline of new opportunities for this service remains robust and we anticipate that this segment will begin to contribute margins that approximate our back-up segment as it achieves scale in the coming years.\r\nOverall, we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us in 2014 and beyond. Our base business remains in very good shape, while our newer lines of business and our markets outside the U.S. continue to have strong growth potential. Our enrollment in our legacy class of profit and loss centers continues to show positive year-over-year trends as capacity utilization continues to recover toward pre-downturn levels. The visibility on our pricing remains solid in the 3% to 4% range compared with more modest projected cost increases.\r\nLastly, we believe that we'll begin to realize the full value of the investments we made this past year in new lease/consortium centers and in acquisitions as we achieve the synergies we planned.\r\nSo all in, our current outlook for 2014 is for revenue growth that approximates 10% to 12% over 2013 levels. We anticipate growing our adjusted EBITDA in the mid to high teens in the range of $240 million to $245 million. This will in turn drive adjusted net income for 2014 in the range of $96 million to $99 million, and adjusted earnings per share growth north of 20% to a range of $1.42 to $1.46 in 2014.\r\nBefore I turn it over to Elizabeth, I wanted to quickly acknowledge a critical aspect of our long-term strategy. That's the unwavering commitment we've made over the years to being the employer of choice in our field. Our intense focus on our culture and work environment is the key reason why our turnover rates remain less than half the industry average. We were proud, once again, this January to be recognized by FORTUNE Magazine as one of the 100 Best Places to Work For in America for the 15th time. We're similarly recognized in the U.K., Ireland and the Netherlands this past year. I want to take a moment to congratulate and thank the great group of people across the Bright Horizons family who make this all possible.\r\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Elizabeth, who will review the numbers in more detail, and I'll be back here with Q&A.\r\nElizabeth?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Dave. So as we've done on previous conference calls, given the various costs and charges we have in our results this year arising from the IPO and refinancing and secondary offerings and acquisitions we've done, I will discuss our reported results, as well as certain metrics that help isolate those unusual or nonrecurring charges. I'll refer you to the earnings release which includes tables and reconcile the U.S. GAAP reported numbers to these additional metrics, specifically for adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and then adjusted EPS. And specifically, we'll be quantifying the one-time charges, as I mentioned, for the IPO and the deal costs, et cetera.\r\nSo top line growth for the quarter was $46 million or 17%, as Dave mentioned, with the full service center business generating $42 million of that gain from rate increases that averaged 3% to 4%, enrollment gains of just under 2% in our mature class of P&L centers and from new organic and acquired centers.\r\nGross profit increased $8 million, or 13%, to $71.2 million in the quarter, again, with the full service segment adding the lion's share of that for $7 million. The gross margin for the quarter was 22.3% compared to 23.1% in 2012. And as Dave mentioned, there are a couple of factors that are affecting the full service margins resulting in a slight decrease year-over-year. First is the larger class of lease/consortium centers that have opened in 2013, or 17, compared to the 4 that we added in 2012. And these new centers generate losses during their ramp-up period and we incurred approximately $1 million more in such ramp-up losses in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to 2012, as well as a total of about $6 million more for the full year in 2013.\r\nIn addition, the Kidsunlimited centers and Children's Choice centers have operated at gross margins ranging from 15% to 20%, and both of them came to us also with a class of newer centers. They are ramping and, therefore, are not at their own mature operating contribution levels. The incremental $29 million of revenue from these 2 larger groups is, therefore, contributing slightly lower gross profit than the overall full-service margins, which approximate 20%.\r\nOn the back-up side, overall contributions continued to be strong in the fourth quarter of 2013 with 30% operating income compared to 29.3% in Q4 of 2012. That trend is consistent with the full year growth as well. Dave discussed the nonrecurring factors affecting the revenue growth comparison in Q4 2013 versus '12, so revenue growth for the full year of 11% in this segment broadly reflects our outlook on the longer-term trend or opportunity for back-up growth in the low teens. The quarterly trend in revenue can vary based on the timing and scale of new client launches, as well as seasonal trends and utilization.\r\nExcluding the one-time transaction costs for Children's Choice, and the secondary offering that was pending at year end, totaling $1.2 million, overhead in the fourth quarter was $31.6 million and decreased to 9.9% of revenue from 10.3% in 2012. As we gained scale across all of our segments and geographies, we are realizing the overhead leverage that we've targeted as a long-term goal. One other factor in 2013, and in the first 3 to 6 months of 2014, is the incremental costs that we are incurring as we complete the integration of the Kids and Children's Choice centers. For reference, we have approximately $4 million in integration costs -- integration-related costs in 2013.\r\nSubsequent to the debt refinancing that we completed back in January of 2013, we've reduced our interest expense this year, and it was $9.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to more than $22 million last year. The amortization expense of $8 million increased $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of '13 in connection with the acquisitions that we've been talking about of Kidsunlimited and Children's Choice.\r\nSo in summary, adjusted net income of $21.2 million translates to adjusted EPS of $0.32 a share in the quarter, up from $0.17 a share in 2012. We generated operating cash flow of $160 million in 2013, which compares to $107 million last year. After deducting our maintenance CapEx of $30 million, free cash flow in 2013 nearly doubled to $130 million from the $66 million that we generated in 2012. The main drivers of this increase are the improved operating performance, lower cash interest expense, which is $17 million for the full year, as well as higher net working capital of about $8 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $30 million in cash and no borrowings outstanding under our revolver.\r\nI'm going to recap the operating stats before I get into the recap of the outlook. So at the end of 2013, we operated 880 centers with total capacity of 99,700, which is an increase of 14% since 12/31/12. We operate approximately 75% of our contracts under profit and loss arrangements and 25% under cost-plus arrangements, and our average full center capacity is now 137 in the U.S., 75 in Europe.\r\nAs Dave previewed, our updated outlook for the 2014 now anticipates revenue growth approximating 10% to 12% over 2013 levels. The components of this top line growth are as follows: organic growth approximating a total of 7% to 9%, which includes the estimated 3% to 4% price increase; 1% to 2% growth in enrollment in our mature and ramping centers; 1% to 2% from new organic full-service center additions; and 1% to 2% growth from back-up and educational advising services.\r\nIn addition to this, acquisitions add approximately 5% to revenue in 2014, inclusive of the lapping effect of the deals we completed in 2013. As always, offsetting these increases by approximately 2% is the impact we estimate from center closings, which includes both legacy organic and in some cases, acquired centers.\r\nWe expect that income from operations in 2014 will approximate 11% of revenue, therefore, expanding by 60 to 75 basis points from the 10.4% adjusted income from operations we generated in 2013. This includes the effect of approximately 20 to 40 basis points of gross margin improvement, plus overhead leverage as we realize the synergy associated with completing the integration of Kids and Children's Choice, and as we continue to scale our overall operations.\r\nWe expect the amortization expense to approximate $30 million for the full year, including $20 million related to our May of 2008 LVO, and for depreciation expense to approximate $51 million to $53 million.\r\nStock compensation expense is projected to be $9 million and interest expense will approximate $34 million to $35 million for the year, assuming continued borrowing rates at approximately 4% on our term loans.\r\nWe are not expecting to have outstanding borrowings under the line of credit during 2014 based on our current projections for what we'll generate in operating cash flow and our capital and acquisition spending plans for the year.\r\nWe estimate that the effective tax rate, both GAAP and the structural tax rate, now that we don't have the anomalies of this year in the results, will approximate 37% to 37.5%, which is slightly higher than the structural rate for 2013 due to the projected higher mix of pretax income generated in the U.S., which has the overall highest marginal tax rate.\r\nCombination of top line growth and margin leverage leads us to project adjusted EBITDA of $240 million to $245 million for 2014, which is an increase of 15% to 17% over the $209 million we reported for this year, and adjusted net income for 2014 in the range of $96 million to $99 million.\r\nWith respect to share count, we currently have 67 million fully diluted shares outstanding and project this to rise approximately 200,000 shares per quarter in 2014, yielding weighted average shares of approximately 67.5 million for the full year. So based on these share counts, we estimate that adjusted EPS will therefore range from $1.42 to $1.46 for the full year.\r\nLastly, we project that we'll generate approximately $170 million of cash flow from operations or $140 million of free cash flow net of projected maintenance capital spending of approximately $30 million. This compares to the $160 million of cash flow and $130 million of free cash flow that I mentioned before for 2013.\r\nThe relatively modest increase is primarily attributable to the higher projection of cash taxes that we expect to pay in 2014 compared to this past year, which benefited from the deductible cost for the IPO and refinancing that we completed at the beginning of the year. Based on the centers and development that's slated to open this year, we expect to invest approximately $45 million in new center capital compared to the $39 million we invested this year.\r\nLooking specifically to the first quarter of 2014, therefore, we are estimating revenue growth in the range of 15% to 17%, adjusted EBITDA of $55 million to $56 million, adjusted net income in the range of $21 million to $22 million, and EPS of approximately $0.32 to $0.33 a share.\r\nSo with that, Jen, we are ready to go to Q&A.",

That's the unwavering commitment we've made over the years to being the employer of choice in our field. Our intense focus on our culture and work environment is the key reason why our turnover rates remain less than half the industry average. We were proud, once again, this January to be recognized by FORTUNE Magazine as one of the 100 Best Places to Work For in America for the 15th time. We're similarly recognized in the U.K., Ireland and the Netherlands this past year. I want to take a moment to congratulate and thank the great group of people across the Bright Horizons family who make this all possible.\r\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Elizabeth, who will review the numbers in more detail, and I'll be back here with Q&A.\r\nElizabeth?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Elizabeth Boland (Executives)】\nThank you, Dave. So as we've done on previous conference calls, given the various costs and charges we have in our results this year arising from the IPO and refinancing and secondary offerings and acquisitions we've done, I will discuss our reported results, as well as certain metrics that help isolate those unusual or nonrecurring charges. I'll refer you to the earnings release which includes tables and reconcile the U.S. GAAP reported numbers to these additional metrics, specifically for adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and then adjusted EPS. And specifically, we'll be quantifying the one-time charges, as I mentioned, for the IPO and the deal costs, et cetera.\r\nSo top line growth for the quarter was $46 million or 17%, as Dave mentioned, with the full service center business generating $42 million of that gain from rate increases that averaged 3% to 4%, enrollment gains of just under 2% in our mature class of P&L centers and from new organic and acquired centers.\r\nGross profit increased $8 million, or 13%, to $71.2 million in the quarter, again, with the full service segment adding the lion's share of that for $7 million. The gross margin for the quarter was 22.3% compared to 23.1% in 2012. And as Dave mentioned, there are a couple of factors that are affecting the full service margins resulting in a slight decrease year-over-year. First is the larger class of lease/consortium centers that have opened in 2013, or 17, compared to the 4 that we added in 2012. And these new centers generate losses during their ramp-up period and we incurred approximately $1 million more in such ramp-up losses in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to 2012, as well as a total of about $6 million more for the full year in 2013.\r\nIn addition, the Kidsunlimited centers and Children's Choice centers have operated at gross margins ranging from 15% to 20%, and both of them came to us also with a class of newer centers. They are ramping and, therefore, are not at their own mature operating contribution levels. The incremental $29 million of revenue from these 2 larger groups is, therefore, contributing slightly lower gross profit than the overall full-service margins, which approximate 20%.\r\nOn the back-up side, overall contributions continued to be strong in the fourth quarter of 2013 with 30% operating income compared to 29.3% in Q4 of 2012. That trend is consistent with the full year growth as well. Dave discussed the nonrecurring factors affecting the revenue growth comparison in Q4 2013 versus '12, so revenue growth for the full year of 11% in this segment broadly reflects our outlook on the longer-term trend or opportunity for back-up growth in the low teens. The quarterly trend in revenue can vary based on the timing and scale of new client launches, as well as seasonal trends and utilization.\r\nExcluding the one-time transaction costs for Children's Choice, and the secondary offering that was pending at year end, totaling $1.2 million, overhead in the fourth quarter was $31.6 million and decreased to 9.9% of revenue from 10.3% in 2012. As we gained scale across all of our segments and geographies, we are realizing the overhead leverage that we've targeted as a long-term goal. One other factor in 2013, and in the first 3 to 6 months of 2014, is the incremental costs that we are incurring as we complete the integration of the Kids and Children's Choice centers. For reference, we have approximately $4 million in integration costs -- integration-related costs in 2013.\r\nSubsequent to the debt refinancing that we completed back in January of 2013, we've reduced our interest expense this year, and it was $9.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to more than $22 million last year. The amortization expense of $8 million increased $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of '13 in connection with the acquisitions that we've been talking about of Kidsunlimited and Children's Choice.\r\nSo in summary, adjusted net income of $21.2 million translates to adjusted EPS of $0.32 a share in the quarter, up from $0.17 a share in 2012. We generated operating cash flow of $160 million in 2013, which compares to $107 million last year. After deducting our maintenance CapEx of $30 million, free cash flow in 2013 nearly doubled to $130 million from the $66 million that we generated in 2012. The main drivers of this increase are the improved operating performance, lower cash interest expense, which is $17 million for the full year, as well as higher net working capital of about $8 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $30 million in cash and no borrowings outstanding under our revolver.\r\nI'm going to recap the operating stats before I get into the recap of the outlook. So at the end of 2013, we operated 880 centers with total capacity of 99,700, which is an increase of 14% since 12/31/12. We operate approximately 75% of our contracts under profit and loss arrangements and 25% under cost-plus arrangements, and our average full center capacity is now 137 in the U.S., 75 in Europe.\r\nAs Dave previewed, our updated outlook for the 2014 now anticipates revenue growth approximating 10% to 12% over 2013 levels. The components of this top line growth are as follows: organic growth approximating a total of 7% to 9%, which includes the estimated 3% to 4% price increase; 1% to 2% growth in enrollment in our mature and ramping centers; 1% to 2% from new organic full-service center additions; and 1% to 2% growth from back-up and educational advising services.\r\nIn addition to this, acquisitions add approximately 5% to revenue in 2014, inclusive of the lapping effect of the deals we completed in 2013. As always, offsetting these increases by approximately 2% is the impact we estimate from center closings, which includes both legacy organic and in some cases, acquired centers.\r\nWe expect that income from operations in 2014 will approximate 11% of revenue, therefore, expanding by 60 to 75 basis points from the 10.4% adjusted income from operations we generated in 2013. This includes the effect of approximately 20 to 40 basis points of gross margin improvement, plus overhead leverage as we realize the synergy associated with completing the integration of Kids and Children's Choice, and as we continue to scale our overall operations.\r\nWe expect the amortization expense to approximate $30 million for the full year, including $20 million related to our May of 2008 LVO, and for depreciation expense to approximate $51 million to $53 million.\r\nStock compensation expense is projected to be $9 million and interest expense will approximate $34 million to $35 million for the year, assuming continued borrowing rates at approximately 4% on our term loans.\r\nWe are not expecting to have outstanding borrowings under the line of credit during 2014 based on our current projections for what we'll generate in operating cash flow and our capital and acquisition spending plans for the year.\r\nWe estimate that the effective tax rate, both GAAP and the structural tax rate, now that we don't have the anomalies of this year in the results, will approximate 37% to 37.5%, which is slightly higher than the structural rate for 2013 due to the projected higher mix of pretax income generated in the U.S., which has the overall highest marginal tax rate.\r\nCombination of top line growth and margin leverage leads us to project adjusted EBITDA of $240 million to $245 million for 2014, which is an increase of 15% to 17% over the $209 million we reported for this year, and adjusted net income for 2014 in the range of $96 million to $99 million.\r\nWith respect to share count, we currently have 67 million fully diluted shares outstanding and project this to rise approximately 200,000 shares per quarter in 2014, yielding weighted average shares of approximately 67.5 million for the full year. So based on these share counts, we estimate that adjusted EPS will therefore range from $1.42 to $1.46 for the full year.\r\nLastly, we project that we'll generate approximately $170 million of cash flow from operations or $140 million of free cash flow net of projected maintenance capital spending of approximately $30 million. This compares to the $160 million of cash flow and $130 million of free cash flow that I mentioned before for 2013.\r\nThe relatively modest increase is primarily attributable to the higher projection of cash taxes that we expect to pay in 2014 compared to this past year, which benefited from the deductible cost for the IPO and refinancing that we completed at the beginning of the year. Based on the centers and development that's slated to open this year, we expect to invest approximately $45 million in new center capital compared to the $39 million we invested this year.\r\nLooking specifically to the first quarter of 2014, therefore, we are estimating revenue growth in the range of 15% to 17%, adjusted EBITDA of $55 million to $56 million, adjusted net income in the range of $21 million to $22 million, and EPS of approximately $0.32 to $0.33 a share.\r\nSo with that, Jen, we are ready to go to Q&A.",
      "transcript_text3": "So just the obvious question on the guidance. It seems to have ticked down 1% on the lower end of the guidance from 11% to 12% to 10% to 12%. Is there anything to read into that? Or what is sort of the explanation behind that?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean I think the only -- there's really nothing to read into it, Dan. I think we feel pretty similar to when we gave the broad base view last time. It's just the only thing that can -- that has the potential to move it around has to deal with timing of when some centers will open in the year and we're just trying to give ourselves a little room with respect to particularly the timing of when things will happen within the year.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then, one follow-up question, if I may. In terms of the accounts receivable and deferred revenue, it seems like accounts receivable has been growing very -- is growing very fast and so is deferred revenue. Is there anything -- it's been growing ahead of revenue, if I calculate it correctly. Is there anything to see there? Or is there any explanation for that? Or what could it be?\n\n---\n\nYes. So that's a good question. The timing of when we bill, just as a matter of reference, when we bill our back-up clients, the majority of those are billed in advance of the start of the year, and we had very strong consistent billing ahead of time. So that's where the deferred revenue comes into play, and it's tied into the receivables. So we don't recognize the revenue until the period of service being rendered. So if you're seeing a deferred revenue balance, it's comprised of the tuitions that we bill and/or collect from parents in advance, and it's any kind of client contractual billing that occurs prior to the service being rendered. So that's arising primarily from the higher back-up billings that we did, just timing wise in 2013 -- for 2014 versus for 2013.\n\n---\n\nThe higher mix of pretax income in the U.S. Is the U.K. business, particularly Kidsunlimited, progressing, as you thought it would, and both from a top line and bottom line perspective?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think broadly the business is -- what we thought it was when we brought it in. I think that there were -- there are a couple of moving parts to just add a little color to. One is that the centers that we acquired that were ramping are ramping broadly in line with what we had hoped when we brought them on. And we did -- as we talked about before, there are a couple of underperformers that were on and that we've either closed or thinking about closing within that group. And then -- but the bigger opportunity I think, with that specific acquisition, is the overhead leverage or overhead synergy that we expect to get. Much, some of which we got slightly ahead of plan in Q4 and then the rest of which, we'll continue to get -- we're getting now and expect to get through the first half of this year. So I would say on the above the sort of revenue line, things are pretty much in line with what we had hoped or thought. And then below that, they're slightly ahead with respect to where we hoped to be. And our goal of getting through the overhead synergy, really for this one and for the Children's Choice acquisition, it is on plan to happen by the middle of this year.\n\n---\n\nSo I think -- let me just answer the question on the pretax income because it might not be clear in what I said which is because we carry the debt here in the U.S., we incurred all of the costs of the refinancing and IPO-related costs in the U.S. results. So the U.S. pretax income was artificially lower this year. So in terms of the adjusted structural rate, we will just have a proportionately slightly higher element next year.\n\n---\n\nSo from a gross margin perspective, it seems like the progress internationally is going along as you thought it would.\n\n---\n\nYes, very much so.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then, final one for me. It sounds like mature center enrollment is trending closer to 2% than 1%, or at least maybe above where you were seeing earlier in 2013. I guess, when do you expect to get back to closer to peak capacity utilization levels? And then, what could that do for margins?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think as we had talked in previous calls, obviously, that's an area of pretty strong focus for us. And you're right, we did experience within the range of 1% to 2%. We experienced growth as we had hoped in this past year, and the trends continue to play out in that direction for 2014. So we believe we have roughly 5 to 6 percentage points of occupancy left to go to recover back to the levels we were pre the downturn times. Obviously, as we've also talked before, we're somewhat gated by the realities of capacity being the lowest in our youngest age groups and graduating classes of children every year in the preschool area, so it takes a couple of years for us to really absorb the increase through the system, and have it actually get back to where we were in the past. Obviously, the margins associated with that are strong. And broadly across the system, the incremental margin's probably twice the gross margin in our core business. So more in the neighborhood of 40% range. And -- but in getting there, we need to get our preschools back full to the levels they were in the downturn, and that's going to take us a couple of years. But the progress is good, it's right on track with what we had hoped. The efforts that we have in place to continue to be sure our centers show really well and have a good strong reputation locally and all the marketing efforts that we do there are really positive, and we're pleased with the direction and we expect that 2014 will yield a similar result to 2013 in that regard.\n\n---\n\nI know it's small, but education advisers saw a nice tick up in the past 2 quarters. Is there anything particular here to note? And do you see that as a good run rate in 2014?\n\n---\n\nSo we have -- I think that you're right. It's a very new business. And so the opportunity there has been good. I think, as Dave cited in his prepared remarks and you may add here, but we now are serving more than 110 clients there, so we've had good interest and feel like it's got a lot of momentum going into next year. And we are investing in the business, too. So I think there's still a little bit of that step cost to absorb. But we're well on our way, I think, to building the pipeline of new opportunities.\n\n---\n\nYes, and we think it's got -- Sara, we continue to be sure that -- and prove, really, the value proposition in the marketplace that we can drive a strong return on investment in that area that's really -- that we can demonstrate employer by employer. And we believe that the more data that we can bring to bear in that area, the better the opportunity will continue to be to spread the word. We are -- that service is a bit of a missionary service. It feels like when we first started doing mostly [ph] child care years ago where we have to really take time to explain the concept because we're not, we're typically not replacing somebody else, it's a new idea that we're bringing to bear and one that we think has good legs.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then, as we think about the types of centers and sort of how that will play out over the next couple of years, do you think we'll see a higher skew of lease/consortium centers over time?\n\n---\n\nI would say you're going to see more lease/consortium centers, I'm not -- it's not -- as a cohort because we believe that there's really good opportunity to leverage the footprint of clients we have around major metropolitan markets across the country. I think the trend that really supports the continued growth of consortium centers is twofold. One, it's the fact that we become a provider, a much broader and deeper provider of solutions to our clients. And our clients expect us to bring solutions to bear in more locations than ever for them, so they can serve as much of their workforce as possible. So to the degree that we can actually continue to have our -- leverage the footprint of where our clients are, we think that's a good use of -- to invest in centers, particularly centers where we've proven we can drive really strong margins over time. And then secondly, we also believe that the continued development of this network directly supports the back-up growth because we're able to then have a much bigger footprint of, really, quality center-based back-up options that exist within the Bright Horizons network, in particular in areas where the supply may not be as robust. So we think that the strategy is solid. I think we'll still continue to grow our other types of centers, too. But we do expect that you saw the numbers this year, we opened 17 versus 4. We probably won't have that kind of growth year-over-year going forward, but we're still very interested in maintaining the numbers that we did this year for the foreseeable future.\n\n---\n\nSo first off, just building on the last question that was asked, do you guys anticipate the impact from the larger cohort of lease/consortium centers to dissipate at any point in 2014? Or do you expect that impact to sort of be ongoing but perhaps at a lesser rate as those centers are just larger in number due to that opportunity you have?\n\n---\n\nYes. So I think broadly, what we would see is, as the cohorts that we opened in 2013 continues to ramp up, there'll be a little bit of -- it will layer in a little bit of cost or loss in 2014. And then, new class that opens in '14 will also have a similar level of losses as the group we had this year. So there will be a slight headwind in '14 about that, but by the end of the year is when we would start to see the class that we're opening in 2013 really making more significant contributions. So we do have 1 more year, I'd qualify it as Dave talking about the size of the classes that we would be looking to and planning to open, probably have 1 more year in '14 where we're incurring a relatively high level of lease/consortium ramp-up losses. But it won't be materially significantly different from this year, a couple of million maybe. And then, it will be embedded in the base, and so our growth against that will -- it will start to comp in a more positive way. I don't know if I answered that clearly enough, but I was...\n\n---\n\nNo, that's about super helpful. I appreciate it. And then, another question, how much did health care and pharmaceuticals comprise of your total revenue for 2013? And which segments by end market didn't grow that well for you guys?\n\n---\n\nSo health care and pharmaceutical, I think we can talk broadly about it. I don't have a revenue number for that group, although the number of centers that we operate for health care and pharmaceutical is now -- it's around 20% of the total group. It ticked up slightly in the quarter. So it's pretty consistent.\n\n---\n\nYes. And I think broadly speaking, as I mentioned earlier, Anj, I think we see the most momentum in the areas of health care and biotech and less of the traditional pharmaceutical companies, mostly because they're already clients. And so the new business in that area is mostly with the biotech companies and then health care systems. And then, higher education continues to be a bright spot for us and then energy and technology are the other areas. I would say that overall, areas of, again, traditional pharmaceuticals, financial services of which we have a lot of already embedded depth in terms of clients, grew at rates slightly less last year than maybe they had in prior years versus the other sectors that I just talked about.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then one final one. Do you, I guess, on the other educational services, the educational advisory services, why were margins so much weaker than they were last year? Are you making any concessions on pricing to drive adoption there higher? Or is that coming all from the investments that you make there?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's really coming at the overhead line and not at -- it's not pricing concessions and it's not -- it's really coming from the investments we're making in increased sales and support people, in trying to perfect the back end of the service, which we're trying to invest in technology to make it less labor intensive. And we expect that it would scale over time, that we can achieve operating margins that look more like the back-up business than the full-service business, but we just think we need some more time to build scale.\n\n---\n\nThe first question just on the back-up services. Is there any way to quantify that Hurricane Sandy impact from last year to sort of normalize what that growth rate will have been? And if there was any seasonal aspect to just a normal fourth quarter that we should consider?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think that with respect to Q3 versus Q4 in general, we would expect to see slightly -- let's say, it tipped down slightly because the Q3 is a particularly higher utilization month, generally speaking -- excuse me, quarter for back-up care than what we would see typically in Q4. But I think that between Hurricane -- to be clear about it, Hurricane Sandy accounted for quite a bit of it and there were a handful of clients back at the end of 2012 that were on contractual arrangements that were sort of the way we used to do it that required the year end sort of true-ups associated with over-use. They've been sort of since redone, to contemplate it on a more regular basis. So the quarter was also -- was part oversized in Q4 '12 by Hurricane Sandy, and the other part by a handful of these larger clients that since been -- contractual changes have been changed. But I think had they not been there, those 2 factors, you would have seen a more normalized growth rate in the 10-ish, 11-ish percent range this quarter. And that's what we expect to see going forward. There's always going to be some quarterly fluctuation in this. Some of it also has to do going forward with when we sign up new business. And when that happens timing wise in a year versus prior year, that can affect things. But on a more normalized basis, we see the low teens growth rate returning in 2014, and that's where we're trending towards thus far this year.\n\n---\n\nGot it. Helpful. And then, sounds like obviously, the integration of those 2 acquisitions are going maybe even ahead of plan. Just out of curiosity, the 5% acquisition contribution that you have for '14, how much of that -- like is the bulk of that basically goes through acquisitions? And how much is the sort of the one-off smaller ones that you guys plan on acquiring?\n\n---\n\nSo I mean, in a normalized year, I think if we look at a long-term growth rate construct, you'd see typically 1% to 2% coming from a typical class of acquisitions. So that order of magnitude, the difference, 5 versus 1 to 2.\n\n---\n\nOkay, fair enough. And then, just one last one. Just in light of this Care.com IPO, just wondering if you could explain sort of your relationship with the Sittercity that you have? I think you have a JV with them, and how that adds to your service offering to the employers?\n\n---\n\nYes. We, Manav, we obviously have been working at ensuring that our service, the back-up care suite of services that we offer, offer clients the most breadth and depth of any back-up care offering in the market. And I think over time, the care sites like Care and Sittercity and others have come to market, it's not a new thing, they've been out there for a while. And I think there's a certain segment of the population within our client companies who want to use those offerings and the value that they bring. So our desire with Sittercity was to form a partnership, whereby all of our back-up clients can have Sittercity packaged into our service. And thus, again, continues to make the Bright Horizons Care Advantage Program the most, the deepest and the broadest service available in the market, with everything we already had to offer plus the addition of that. Frankly, from -- other than -- if you remove marketing and a lot of things, the caregivers that exist on these sites are pretty much the same. And so the idea would be for people who are looking for or are interested in having care arrangements go in that area, we felt Sittercity was a great option and they're a great partner, and we'll just make our -- round out the services I just talked about before.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to go back, once again, to the lease/consortia centers, if I could. And maybe ask you to just comment on what you see as the drivers of growth? Because it sounded like from your answer to Sara's question that a lot of that is from your own prospecting internally with your existing clients, so I wonder if you can talk to that. And then, and maybe kind of what level you can sustain in terms of growth in that, if that is the major source or maybe it's not?\n\n---\n\nWell, yes, I think, Trace, the -- to be clear about it, it's largely driven to leverage the footprint of where our clients are, but also those centers have to be able to exist, if you will, in places that we think that for the rest of the spaces, that can't be used by clients or used for back-up, that there's a good, strong demand in the area of parents who desire our types of service and that can afford it. And so our focus in this area has been in and around major metropolitan areas, like New York and Chicago and San Francisco and other sort of -- Seattle, other select cities where we think that can happen. And also following the trend that, obviously, many young professional families are choosing to live closer in or in cities versus making the mad dash for the suburbs as soon as the child is born. So I think all these trends sort of work in our favor and produce, we think, a good runway for this area for us. And not just in the United States, this is true in places like London, in Amsterdam and other places that we operate in. We think we have a good runway or visibility to continue to do, order of magnitude, the number of sites, globally, that we achieved this year for the foreseeable future.\n\n---\n\nSo Dave, then how do you identify opportunities in that segment? And how do you think about forecasting? I mean, is there a pipeline? It strikes me that the pipeline would be pretty different from the pipeline for corporate-sponsored centers. Can you just talk to that?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, the pipeline is derived through a combination of a real estate team that's actually actively looking at sites, combined with our sales team, which -- and our client management team, which is actively managing both the interest of new clients and of the existing clients to where they would be interested. And then, it's sort of a collision of those 2 efforts that produces the best site prospects for us. And then, obviously, the real estate team goes and executes on them. So some of it is -- it is a pipeline of prospects that exist out there. And then, obviously, once we sign a lease on something like that, we then consider that in our pipeline of centers under development, and then obviously, it opens with pretty similar characteristics to the time line a corporate-sponsored center would open.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then, last question. Since the last time you guys had a call, we've had a lot of discussion of universal child care, the President talked about it in the State of the Union, New York managed to elect Bill de Blasio, who's got that as high priority. Can you speak to that phenomenon? To what extent do you see it as any kind of a threat in terms of peeling off 4-year-olds from your centers, if you do? Or maybe, conversely, to what extent could it be a future opportunity for you?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, I think, first off, I think good discussion about the value of quality early education is good for all of us who have believed in this for a long time and are all providers, I believe. I think it's -- I think that the reality, of course, of where this all will go will come down to the fiscal realities that states and cities have and how they ultimately choose to take whatever finite resources they have and execute. Most of the universal pre-K efforts that we're currently used to like those that we see in Georgia and in Florida, represent a partial day offering for 4-year-olds that doesn't fully meet the needs of working families. And those systems do allow for us and other providers, private providers, to participate. And I would anticipate that in most places around the country, whatever universal pre-K legislation is conceived of that can be afforded, first resources will go to those most in need. And after that, which isn't really our market, but after that, to the degree it becomes universal, it'll probably represent some portion of what we provide, and that we could wrap around that like we do in Georgia and Florida. So in those cases, we actually take the state funding for part of a few days a week for the children that participate in that. And then, our program's sort of wrapped around it because the parents that we're serving need a full-day option, they can't go with just a partial day, a couple of days a week. And that's broadly speaking, the same way we operate in London and in the Netherlands, too. So that's my view on it. I think I'm a little skeptical that there'll be enough places that will have enough money to fully execute on it. But where that does happen, I feel good about our opportunity to participate in whatever system happens.\n\n---\n\nYes. Flavor of the day, lease/consortium centers. Can you remind us what percentage of full-service enrollment at the lease/consortium centers come to you through an employer, one of the employer partners?\n\n---\n\nYes, we don't -- I'm not sure, Jeff, we have that stat across the board to give you today. Broadly, those centers, though, are a real combination. If you look at it across the system, you have those that are fully -- on each end, you have those that are fully sort of enrolled through sponsorship or back-up care, all the way to the other side, which there's just a mild bit of back-up use and many of the spaces are enrolled through the community to what I would call a more usual situation, where you'd have centers that are sponsored with, call it a quarter to half the spaces and the rest in the community plus back-up on top of that. So it's really a broad spectrum. I'm not sure we can -- we can probably do some work on that in the future, but I'm not sure we have the stat you're looking for today.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then on full service, I don't remember [indiscernible] the rest of your students, rolling on and rolling off. So...\n\n---\n\nJeff, we're having a little trouble hearing you.\n\n---\n\nThe full service, can you just give us a sense of the organic revenue growth trend there?\n\n---\n\nSo full service centers in -- well, let me just see if I can pull that back up because I -- I mean, our organic growth in the year, we outlined -- briefly...\n\n---\n\nWhat I'm wondering is the step up in the growth rate in Q4.\n\n---\n\nRight. Yes, there is a bit of -- that's part of the momentum behind the additional enrollment. And on a gross basis, the organic growth is around 7% and net of closures, the effect of closures is around 5%. So we did see a bit of an uptick in Q4 for that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then, just finally, there was a fairly sizable outback to cash flow that was characterized as other, what is that?\n\n---\n\nSorry, let me just get over to the -- so the changes in assets and liabilities. So that's primarily the change arising from deferred revenue that was -- that Dan Dolev asked about earlier. So we had fairly significant -- you can see the uptick in receivables as well and deferred revenue due to the billing, primarily the billing in back-up care.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to ask on the international side, what are the dynamics for your centers in Netherlands? You mentioned 5 new centers, how do they compare to the ones in the U.K. or U.S.? And perhaps, can you update us on your methodology for looking at other international markets?\n\n---\n\nYes. So Jeff, the metrics that we would use to evaluate a center in the Netherlands fall closer to what -- the way we'd look at a consortium center here in the U.S. or the U.K. The Netherlands has a funding scheme, as we've talked about in the past, where an individual's funding comes through -- partially through the government and partially through a fund that employers contribute to such that the amount that parents pay is pretty subsidized there. So in effect, what we're doing in the Netherlands is finding the best possible locations, both located near employment generators and also near good communities that can support our growth, our type of parent and looking for the right location that can return the returns that we would look for in a consortium model. Generally speaking, when we're investing our capital in a consortium model, we're looking for IRRs north of 20%, and that metric is a metric that we use here in the U.S., in the Netherlands and in the U.K., with respect to investing our capital in these sites. Did I take your question?\n\n---\n\nThat's perfect, that's very helpful. And just a couple of model questions. Elizabeth, in the past, so you've just given us for the current -- for the fourth quarter, for the reported quarter, contribution from acquired revenues. I kind of ask in another way what Jeff was asking before, in dollar terms.\n\n---\n\nYes, in dollar terms. So it was $29 million, I think I said that in the prepared remarks, $29 million from the acquisitions in the fourth quarter.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And just to clarify, embedded in your 2014 guidance, what are the dynamics for segment margins?\n\n---\n\nSo just from a forward-looking view, I think on balance, we would be seeing some expansion in the full-service business for the various reasons we cited on where we have leverage with tuition -- tuition ahead of costs, enrollment, ramp in our ramping centers, as well as in the mature class, and then offset by the effect of some lease/consortium center impact. So there's margin expansion in full service, there's stable margins in the back-up business and that's really a growth story. And it's a more mature sort of business compared to, for example, the ed advisory business which is still very much a nascent, developing business where we would expect to see the margins expanding. We have some step-cost investment there. But on balance as we add clients, we're leveraging both at the gross margin and at the operating margin level.\n\n---\n\nI'll be quick, and hopefully, I just wanted to follow up on that. You guys indicated in your guidance that you're expecting 3% to 4% price increases. Just wondering what you're seeing on the cost side given some discussion about minimum wage increases and a strengthening job market, if you're starting to see any signs on the cost side for wage pressure.\n\n---\n\nYes. We still believe, Jerry, that the cost increases will average about 1% less than our average pricing increases based on what we see this year. We feel good about the sort of compensation packages that we have in place. I think we've talked about this in the past, combining our wage rate with the benefits package that Bright Horizons offers. We feel, obviously, we feel good about that. Overall, obviously, everybody follows the minimum wage debate. We don't believe -- while it'll have some mild impact, it's not a real big impact at all on us given where our wage tends to sit in the centers that we operate.\n\n---\n\nAnd just one real quick follow-up. Dave, we missed the day when you give some metrics on the pipeline. I know you're not going to give any numbers, but can you just talk conceptually about sort of trends and your feelings in the pipeline?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, like I said in the remarks, Jerry, I feel like the pipeline is representative of the industries -- slightly higher representative of the industries that I talked about before: health care, technology, energy, higher education. And I think that we obviously have in the pipeline some new lease/consortium models that we feel good about that are taking advantage of some of the client relationships that I talked about earlier when previous questions were asked. So we think that the pipeline continues to give us visibility that the center targets that we have for 2014 are in line.\n\n---\n\nI guess, let me just first follow up on 2, quickly, on 2 questions that were asked earlier, and probably too many people are asking about the lease/consortiums. But if you continue to grow that as a percent of the mix, at some point in the future, does this make the business at all more volatile, like if the economy turns down, given that those sheets [ph] aren't all accounted for? Or is that really you're not expecting that much different than the rest of the mature base?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think, Gary, to a degree -- I mean obviously, the place where we're more vulnerable in a downturn when you look at the sort of overall portfolio of the business is the centers in which we have P&L responsibility for, and that's what we experienced in 2008, 2009, '10 time frame in that class. I think that the key for us is that the centers, obviously, combine both community, back-up and corporate sponsorship in them. So we're not -- we still remain, I think, with this model less exposed than sort of a straight retail model would because of the corporate sponsorship and because of the back-up business. And again, I think we'll continue to grow other models, too. So maybe on the margin slightly. But I still think many of the -- I would still anticipate that overall, the way the company performed during the last downturn is probably indicative of what we might expect, should we experience something similar in the future.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then, on the whole universal pre-K concept, you talked about Georgia and Florida. Can you just give us a commentary, are your margins the same despite probably getting the lower state fees for part of the week, as they are in the rest of the business?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think our margins are in line in those states with the rest of the business. I think, again, the key there is that we are wrapping around whatever the reimbursement is in those places in order to complete essentially a view of what our tuitions would average in those areas when we take what's paid for, what we -- sort of what's subsidized or what the parents would have to pay to wrap around for care for whatever hours they're going to wrap around.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then, just last one on -- any updated thoughts on leverage and the leverage target? I know you brought the leverage down a lot with the IPO. It hasn't come down a lot since then, obviously, with you investing all of your cash flows through the M&A and the internal investment. But would you be comfortable just having the leverage come down going forward, just from the growth of your cash flow and continue to invest all of excess cash flow? Or any thoughts on how we might think about it over the next couple of years?\n\n---\n\nYes, I'll let Elizabeth, in a second, Gary, comment on the specifics of kind of what we see on that and what we expect in '14. But I would say broadly that we believe that first and foremost, to the degree we can find acquisitions and/or new center of growth opportunities that meet our investment thresholds or return thresholds, that's probably the best way we can drive value for everybody with the cash that we generate in the business. To the degree that we're in a situation in the future -- and that's what happened this year, we were able to do that, essentially deploy all of our cash, end with a little bit of cash, but not much and not really have anything on the revolver. And we did see some modest deleveraging just with growth. We'll continue to see that, as Elizabeth can add color to. But I think going forward, if we find ourselves with the sort of high-class problem of not -- having too much cash that we generate, more so than we can invest with good investments back in the business, then I think we would look at the 3 options that would exist there, whether that be a dividend, a buyback plan or paying down some debt. The caveat on paying down the debt is we feel very good at the 4% rate that we have now, that that's a pretty -- it's efficient. It's efficient for us at that level. So if it stayed that way going forward, it would be more likely that our choice would be either a buyback or a dividend.\n\n---\n\nYes, I agree and I think that we're ending the year at under 4% or 3.75% without even considering the full year contribution that we would get from the acquisitions that done mid-year. So by the end of this year, we'll be close to 3 turns on our adjusted EBITDA, and we feel like that's very comfortable to just continue to grow into it with our natural -- the natural deleveraging that occurs there for the short foreseeable future.\n\n---\n\nJust a real quick one. Elizabeth, that $29 million, you mentioned in acquired revenues, was that all of the full-service center segment?\n\n---\n\nYes, it is. And I just -- to clarify a question that came through earlier, so our back-up in that advisory growth in the quarter was a neighborhood of 1.5%. And so full-service organic growth is just over 7% growth, and then there's closures against that, that bring it down to around 5%. So that was just the full service on business, not the other organic growth. So I think that we're out of time.\n\n---\n\nI agree. Yes. Appreciate everybody's time. And thanks for the questions, and we'll be talking to you, I'm sure, in the near future. Have a good night.\n\n---\n\nThank you.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Dan Dolev (Analysts)】\nSo just the obvious question on the guidance. It seems to have ticked down 1% on the lower end of the guidance from 11% to 12% to 10% to 12%. Is there anything to read into that? Or what is sort of the explanation behind that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Lissy (Executives)】\nYes, I mean I think the only -- there's really nothing to read into it, Dan. I think we feel pretty similar to when we gave the broad base view last time. It's just the only thing that can -- that has the potential to move it around has to deal with timing of when some centers will open in the year and we're just trying to give ourselves a little room with respect to particularly the timing of when things will happen within the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Dan Dolev (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then, one follow-up question, if I may. In terms of the accounts receivable and deferred revenue, it seems like accounts receivable has been growing very -- is growing very fast and so is deferred revenue. Is there anything -- it's been growing ahead of revenue, if I calculate it correctly. Is there anything to see there? Or is there any explanation for that? Or what could it be?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elizabeth Boland (Executives)】\nYes. So that's a good question. The timing of when we bill, just as a matter of reference, when we bill our back-up clients, the majority of those are billed in advance of the start of the year, and we had very strong consistent billing ahead of time. So that's where the deferred revenue comes into play, and it's tied into the receivables. So we don't recognize the revenue until the period of service being rendered. So if you're seeing a deferred revenue balance, it's comprised of the tuitions that we bill and/or collect from parents in advance, and it's any kind of client contractual billing that occurs prior to the service being rendered. So that's arising primarily from the higher back-up billings that we did, just timing wise in 2013 -- for 2014 versus for 2013.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy Connor (Analysts)】\nThe higher mix of pretax income in the U.S. Is the U.K. business, particularly Kidsunlimited, progressing, as you thought it would, and both from a top line and bottom line perspective?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Lissy (Executives)】\nYes. I think broadly the business is -- what we thought it was when we brought it in. I think that there were -- there are a couple of moving parts to just add a little color to. One is that the centers that we acquired that were ramping are ramping broadly in line with what we had hoped when we brought them on. And we did -- as we talked about before, there are a couple of underperformers that were on and that we've either closed or thinking about closing within that group. And then -- but the bigger opportunity I think, with that specific acquisition, is the overhead leverage or overhead synergy that we expect to get. Much, some of which we got slightly ahead of plan in Q4 and then the rest of which, we'll continue to get -- we're getting now and expect to get through the first half of this year. So I would say on the above the sort of revenue line, things are pretty much in line with what we had hoped or thought. And then below that, they're slightly ahead with respect to where we hoped to be. And our goal of getting through the overhead synergy, really for this one and for the Children's Choice acquisition, it is on plan to happen by the middle of this year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elizabeth Boland (Executives)】\nSo I think -- let me just answer the question on the pretax income because it might not be clear in what I said which is because we carry the debt here in the U.S., we incurred all of the costs of the refinancing and IPO-related costs in the U.S. results. So the U.S. pretax income was artificially lower this year. So in terms of the adjusted structural rate, we will just have a proportionately slightly higher element next year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy Connor (Analysts)】\nSo from a gross margin perspective, it seems like the progress internationally is going along as you thought it would.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elizabeth Boland (Executives)】\nYes, very much so.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy Connor (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then, final one for me. It sounds like mature center enrollment is trending closer to 2% than 1%, or at least maybe above where you were seeing earlier in 2013. I guess, when do you expect to get back to closer to peak capacity utilization levels? And then, what could that do for margins?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Lissy (Executives)】\nYes. I think as we had talked in previous calls, obviously, that's an area of pretty strong focus for us. And you're right, we did experience within the range of 1% to 2%. We experienced growth as we had hoped in this past year, and the trends continue to play out in that direction for 2014. So we believe we have roughly 5 to 6 percentage points of occupancy left to go to recover back to the levels we were pre the downturn times. Obviously, as we've also talked before, we're somewhat gated by the realities of capacity being the lowest in our youngest age groups and graduating classes of children every year in the preschool area, so it takes a couple of years for us to really absorb the increase through the system, and have it actually get back to where we were in the past. Obviously, the margins associated with that are strong. And broadly across the system, the incremental margin's probably twice the gross margin in our core business. So more in the neighborhood of 40% range. And -- but in getting there, we need to get our preschools back full to the levels they were in the downturn, and that's going to take us a couple of years. But the progress is good, it's right on track with what we had hoped. The efforts that we have in place to continue to be sure our centers show really well and have a good strong reputation locally and all the marketing efforts that we do there are really positive, and we're pleased with the direction and we expect that 2014 will yield a similar result to 2013 in that regard.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sara Gubins (Analysts)】\nI know it's small, but education advisers saw a nice tick up in the past 2 quarters. Is there anything particular here to note? And do you see that as a good run rate in 2014?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elizabeth Boland (Executives)】\nSo we have -- I think that you're right. It's a very new business. And so the opportunity there has been good. I think, as Dave cited in his prepared remarks and you may add here, but we now are serving more than 110 clients there, so we've had good interest and feel like it's got a lot of momentum going into next year. And we are investing in the business, too. So I think there's still a little bit of that step cost to absorb. But we're well on our way, I think, to building the pipeline of new opportunities.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Lissy (Executives)】\nYes, and we think it's got -- Sara, we continue to be sure that -- and prove, really, the value proposition in the marketplace that we can drive a strong return on investment in that area that's really -- that we can demonstrate employer by employer. And we believe that the more data that we can bring to bear in that area, the better the opportunity will continue to be to spread the word. We are -- that service is a bit of a missionary service. It feels like when we first started doing mostly [ph] child care years ago where we have to really take time to explain the concept because we're not, we're typically not replacing somebody else, it's a new idea that we're bringing to bear and one that we think has good legs.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sara Gubins (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then, as we think about the types of centers and sort of how that will play out over the next couple of years, do you think we'll see a higher skew of lease/consortium centers over time?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Lissy (Executives)】\nI would say you're going to see more lease/consortium centers, I'm not -- it's not -- as a cohort because we believe that there's really good opportunity to leverage the footprint of clients we have around major metropolitan markets across the country. I think the trend that really supports the continued growth of consortium centers is twofold. One, it's the fact that we become a provider, a much broader and deeper provider of solutions to our clients. And our clients expect us to bring solutions to bear in more locations than ever for them, so they can serve as much of their workforce as possible. So to the degree that we can actually continue to have our -- leverage the footprint of where our clients are, we think that's a good use of -- to invest in centers, particularly centers where we've proven we can drive really strong margins over time. And then secondly, we also believe that the continued development of this network directly supports the back-up growth because we're able to then have a much bigger footprint of, really, quality center-based back-up options that exist within the Bright Horizons network, in particular in areas where the supply may not be as robust. So we think that the strategy is solid. I think we'll still continue to grow our other types of centers, too. But we do expect that you saw the numbers this year, we opened 17 versus 4. We probably won't have that kind of growth year-over-year going forward, but we're still very interested in maintaining the numbers that we did this year for the foreseeable future.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anjaneya Singh (Analysts)】\nSo first off, just building on the last question that was asked, do you guys anticipate the impact from the larger cohort of lease/consortium centers to dissipate at any point in 2014? Or do you expect that impact to sort of be ongoing but perhaps at a lesser rate as those centers are just larger in number due to that opportunity you have?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elizabeth Boland (Executives)】\nYes. So I think broadly, what we would see is, as the cohorts that we opened in 2013 continues to ramp up, there'll be a little bit of -- it will layer in a little bit of cost or loss in 2014. And then, new class that opens in '14 will also have a similar level of losses as the group we had this year. So there will be a slight headwind in '14 about that, but by the end of the year is when we would start to see the class that we're opening in 2013 really making more significant contributions. So we do have 1 more year, I'd qualify it as Dave talking about the size of the classes that we would be looking to and planning to open, probably have 1 more year in '14 where we're incurring a relatively high level of lease/consortium ramp-up losses. But it won't be materially significantly different from this year, a couple of million maybe. And then, it will be embedded in the base, and so our growth against that will -- it will start to comp in a more positive way. I don't know if I answered that clearly enough, but I was...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anjaneya Singh (Analysts)】\nNo, that's about super helpful. I appreciate it. And then, another question, how much did health care and pharmaceuticals comprise of your total revenue for 2013? And which segments by end market didn't grow that well for you guys?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elizabeth Boland (Executives)】\nSo health care and pharmaceutical, I think we can talk broadly about it. I don't have a revenue number for that group, although the number of centers that we operate for health care and pharmaceutical is now -- it's around 20% of the total group. It ticked up slightly in the quarter. So it's pretty consistent.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Lissy (Executives)】\nYes. And I think broadly speaking, as I mentioned earlier, Anj, I think we see the most momentum in the areas of health care and biotech and less of the traditional pharmaceutical companies, mostly because they're already clients. And so the new business in that area is mostly with the biotech companies and then health care systems. And then, higher education continues to be a bright spot for us and then energy and technology are the other areas. I would say that overall, areas of, again, traditional pharmaceuticals, financial services of which we have a lot of already embedded depth in terms of clients, grew at rates slightly less last year than maybe they had in prior years versus the other sectors that I just talked about.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anjaneya Singh (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then one final one. Do you, I guess, on the other educational services, the educational advisory services, why were margins so much weaker than they were last year? Are you making any concessions on pricing to drive adoption there higher? Or is that coming all from the investments that you make there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Lissy (Executives)】\nYes, it's really coming at the overhead line and not at -- it's not pricing concessions and it's not -- it's really coming from the investments we're making in increased sales and support people, in trying to perfect the back end of the service, which we're trying to invest in technology to make it less labor intensive. And we expect that it would scale over time, that we can achieve operating margins that look more like the back-up business than the full-service business, but we just think we need some more time to build scale.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Manav Patnaik (Analysts)】\nThe first question just on the back-up services. Is there any way to quantify that Hurricane Sandy impact from last year to sort of normalize what that growth rate will have been? And if there was any seasonal aspect to just a normal fourth quarter that we should consider?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Lissy (Executives)】\nWell, I think that with respect to Q3 versus Q4 in general, we would expect to see slightly -- let's say, it tipped down slightly because the Q3 is a particularly higher utilization month, generally speaking -- excuse me, quarter for back-up care than what we would see typically in Q4. But I think that between Hurricane -- to be clear about it, Hurricane Sandy accounted for quite a bit of it and there were a handful of clients back at the end of 2012 that were on contractual arrangements that were sort of the way we used to do it that required the year end sort of true-ups associated with over-use. They've been sort of since redone, to contemplate it on a more regular basis. So the quarter was also -- was part oversized in Q4 '12 by Hurricane Sandy, and the other part by a handful of these larger clients that since been -- contractual changes have been changed. But I think had they not been there, those 2 factors, you would have seen a more normalized growth rate in the 10-ish, 11-ish percent range this quarter. And that's what we expect to see going forward. There's always going to be some quarterly fluctuation in this. Some of it also has to do going forward with when we sign up new business. And when that happens timing wise in a year versus prior year, that can affect things. But on a more normalized basis, we see the low teens growth rate returning in 2014, and that's where we're trending towards thus far this year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Manav Patnaik (Analysts)】\nGot it. Helpful. And then, sounds like obviously, the integration of those 2 acquisitions are going maybe even ahead of plan. Just out of curiosity, the 5% acquisition contribution that you have for '14, how much of that -- like is the bulk of that basically goes through acquisitions? And how much is the sort of the one-off smaller ones that you guys plan on acquiring?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elizabeth Boland (Executives)】\nSo I mean, in a normalized year, I think if we look at a long-term growth rate construct, you'd see typically 1% to 2% coming from a typical class of acquisitions. So that order of magnitude, the difference, 5 versus 1 to 2.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Manav Patnaik (Analysts)】\nOkay, fair enough. And then, just one last one. Just in light of this Care.com IPO, just wondering if you could explain sort of your relationship with the Sittercity that you have? I think you have a JV with them, and how that adds to your service offering to the employers?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Lissy (Executives)】\nYes. We, Manav, we obviously have been working at ensuring that our service, the back-up care suite of services that we offer, offer clients the most breadth and depth of any back-up care offering in the market. And I think over time, the care sites like Care and Sittercity and others have come to market, it's not a new thing, they've been out there for a while. And I think there's a certain segment of the population within our client companies who want to use those offerings and the value that they bring. So our desire with Sittercity was to form a partnership, whereby all of our back-up clients can have Sittercity packaged into our service. And thus, again, continues to make the Bright Horizons Care Advantage Program the most, the deepest and the broadest service available in the market, with everything we already had to offer plus the addition of that. Frankly, from -- other than -- if you remove marketing and a lot of things, the caregivers that exist on these sites are pretty much the same. And so the idea would be for people who are looking for or are interested in having care arrangements go in that area, we felt Sittercity was a great option and they're a great partner, and we'll just make our -- round out the services I just talked about before.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Trace Urdan (Analysts)】\nI wanted to go back, once again, to the lease/consortia centers, if I could. And maybe ask you to just comment on what you see as the drivers of growth? Because it sounded like from your answer to Sara's question that a lot of that is from your own prospecting internally with your existing clients, so I wonder if you can talk to that. And then, and maybe kind of what level you can sustain in terms of growth in that, if that is the major source or maybe it's not?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Lissy (Executives)】\nWell, yes, I think, Trace, the -- to be clear about it, it's largely driven to leverage the footprint of where our clients are, but also those centers have to be able to exist, if you will, in places that we think that for the rest of the spaces, that can't be used by clients or used for back-up, that there's a good, strong demand in the area of parents who desire our types of service and that can afford it. And so our focus in this area has been in and around major metropolitan areas, like New York and Chicago and San Francisco and other sort of -- Seattle, other select cities where we think that can happen. And also following the trend that, obviously, many young professional families are choosing to live closer in or in cities versus making the mad dash for the suburbs as soon as the child is born. So I think all these trends sort of work in our favor and produce, we think, a good runway for this area for us. And not just in the United States, this is true in places like London, in Amsterdam and other places that we operate in. We think we have a good runway or visibility to continue to do, order of magnitude, the number of sites, globally, that we achieved this year for the foreseeable future.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Trace Urdan (Analysts)】\nSo Dave, then how do you identify opportunities in that segment? And how do you think about forecasting? I mean, is there a pipeline? It strikes me that the pipeline would be pretty different from the pipeline for corporate-sponsored centers. Can you just talk to that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Lissy (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, the pipeline is derived through a combination of a real estate team that's actually actively looking at sites, combined with our sales team, which -- and our client management team, which is actively managing both the interest of new clients and of the existing clients to where they would be interested. And then, it's sort of a collision of those 2 efforts that produces the best site prospects for us. And then, obviously, the real estate team goes and executes on them. So some of it is -- it is a pipeline of prospects that exist out there. And then, obviously, once we sign a lease on something like that, we then consider that in our pipeline of centers under development, and then obviously, it opens with pretty similar characteristics to the time line a corporate-sponsored center would open.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Trace Urdan (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then, last question. Since the last time you guys had a call, we've had a lot of discussion of universal child care, the President talked about it in the State of the Union, New York managed to elect Bill de Blasio, who's got that as high priority. Can you speak to that phenomenon? To what extent do you see it as any kind of a threat in terms of peeling off 4-year-olds from your centers, if you do? Or maybe, conversely, to what extent could it be a future opportunity for you?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Lissy (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, I think, first off, I think good discussion about the value of quality early education is good for all of us who have believed in this for a long time and are all providers, I believe. I think it's -- I think that the reality, of course, of where this all will go will come down to the fiscal realities that states and cities have and how they ultimately choose to take whatever finite resources they have and execute. Most of the universal pre-K efforts that we're currently used to like those that we see in Georgia and in Florida, represent a partial day offering for 4-year-olds that doesn't fully meet the needs of working families. And those systems do allow for us and other providers, private providers, to participate. And I would anticipate that in most places around the country, whatever universal pre-K legislation is conceived of that can be afforded, first resources will go to those most in need. And after that, which isn't really our market, but after that, to the degree it becomes universal, it'll probably represent some portion of what we provide, and that we could wrap around that like we do in Georgia and Florida. So in those cases, we actually take the state funding for part of a few days a week for the children that participate in that. And then, our program's sort of wrapped around it because the parents that we're serving need a full-day option, they can't go with just a partial day, a couple of days a week. And that's broadly speaking, the same way we operate in London and in the Netherlands, too. So that's my view on it. I think I'm a little skeptical that there'll be enough places that will have enough money to fully execute on it. But where that does happen, I feel good about our opportunity to participate in whatever system happens.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Meuler (Analysts)】\nYes. Flavor of the day, lease/consortium centers. Can you remind us what percentage of full-service enrollment at the lease/consortium centers come to you through an employer, one of the employer partners?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Lissy (Executives)】\nYes, we don't -- I'm not sure, Jeff, we have that stat across the board to give you today. Broadly, those centers, though, are a real combination. If you look at it across the system, you have those that are fully -- on each end, you have those that are fully sort of enrolled through sponsorship or back-up care, all the way to the other side, which there's just a mild bit of back-up use and many of the spaces are enrolled through the community to what I would call a more usual situation, where you'd have centers that are sponsored with, call it a quarter to half the spaces and the rest in the community plus back-up on top of that. So it's really a broad spectrum. I'm not sure we can -- we can probably do some work on that in the future, but I'm not sure we have the stat you're looking for today.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Meuler (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then on full service, I don't remember [indiscernible] the rest of your students, rolling on and rolling off. So...\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Lissy (Executives)】\nJeff, we're having a little trouble hearing you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Meuler (Analysts)】\nThe full service, can you just give us a sense of the organic revenue growth trend there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elizabeth Boland (Executives)】\nSo full service centers in -- well, let me just see if I can pull that back up because I -- I mean, our organic growth in the year, we outlined -- briefly...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Meuler (Analysts)】\nWhat I'm wondering is the step up in the growth rate in Q4.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elizabeth Boland (Executives)】\nRight. Yes, there is a bit of -- that's part of the momentum behind the additional enrollment. And on a gross basis, the organic growth is around 7% and net of closures, the effect of closures is around 5%. So we did see a bit of an uptick in Q4 for that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Meuler (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then, just finally, there was a fairly sizable outback to cash flow that was characterized as other, what is that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elizabeth Boland (Executives)】\nSorry, let me just get over to the -- so the changes in assets and liabilities. So that's primarily the change arising from deferred revenue that was -- that Dan Dolev asked about earlier. So we had fairly significant -- you can see the uptick in receivables as well and deferred revenue due to the billing, primarily the billing in back-up care.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Volshteyn (Analysts)】\nI wanted to ask on the international side, what are the dynamics for your centers in Netherlands? You mentioned 5 new centers, how do they compare to the ones in the U.K. or U.S.? And perhaps, can you update us on your methodology for looking at other international markets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Lissy (Executives)】\nYes. So Jeff, the metrics that we would use to evaluate a center in the Netherlands fall closer to what -- the way we'd look at a consortium center here in the U.S. or the U.K. The Netherlands has a funding scheme, as we've talked about in the past, where an individual's funding comes through -- partially through the government and partially through a fund that employers contribute to such that the amount that parents pay is pretty subsidized there. So in effect, what we're doing in the Netherlands is finding the best possible locations, both located near employment generators and also near good communities that can support our growth, our type of parent and looking for the right location that can return the returns that we would look for in a consortium model. Generally speaking, when we're investing our capital in a consortium model, we're looking for IRRs north of 20%, and that metric is a metric that we use here in the U.S., in the Netherlands and in the U.K., with respect to investing our capital in these sites. Did I take your question?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Volshteyn (Analysts)】\nThat's perfect, that's very helpful. And just a couple of model questions. Elizabeth, in the past, so you've just given us for the current -- for the fourth quarter, for the reported quarter, contribution from acquired revenues. I kind of ask in another way what Jeff was asking before, in dollar terms.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elizabeth Boland (Executives)】\nYes, in dollar terms. So it was $29 million, I think I said that in the prepared remarks, $29 million from the acquisitions in the fourth quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Volshteyn (Analysts)】\nGreat. And just to clarify, embedded in your 2014 guidance, what are the dynamics for segment margins?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elizabeth Boland (Executives)】\nSo just from a forward-looking view, I think on balance, we would be seeing some expansion in the full-service business for the various reasons we cited on where we have leverage with tuition -- tuition ahead of costs, enrollment, ramp in our ramping centers, as well as in the mature class, and then offset by the effect of some lease/consortium center impact. So there's margin expansion in full service, there's stable margins in the back-up business and that's really a growth story. And it's a more mature sort of business compared to, for example, the ed advisory business which is still very much a nascent, developing business where we would expect to see the margins expanding. We have some step-cost investment there. But on balance as we add clients, we're leveraging both at the gross margin and at the operating margin level.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jerry Herman (Analysts)】\nI'll be quick, and hopefully, I just wanted to follow up on that. You guys indicated in your guidance that you're expecting 3% to 4% price increases. Just wondering what you're seeing on the cost side given some discussion about minimum wage increases and a strengthening job market, if you're starting to see any signs on the cost side for wage pressure.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Lissy (Executives)】\nYes. We still believe, Jerry, that the cost increases will average about 1% less than our average pricing increases based on what we see this year. We feel good about the sort of compensation packages that we have in place. I think we've talked about this in the past, combining our wage rate with the benefits package that Bright Horizons offers. We feel, obviously, we feel good about that. Overall, obviously, everybody follows the minimum wage debate. We don't believe -- while it'll have some mild impact, it's not a real big impact at all on us given where our wage tends to sit in the centers that we operate.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jerry Herman (Analysts)】\nAnd just one real quick follow-up. Dave, we missed the day when you give some metrics on the pipeline. I know you're not going to give any numbers, but can you just talk conceptually about sort of trends and your feelings in the pipeline?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Lissy (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, like I said in the remarks, Jerry, I feel like the pipeline is representative of the industries -- slightly higher representative of the industries that I talked about before: health care, technology, energy, higher education. And I think that we obviously have in the pipeline some new lease/consortium models that we feel good about that are taking advantage of some of the client relationships that I talked about earlier when previous questions were asked. So we think that the pipeline continues to give us visibility that the center targets that we have for 2014 are in line.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gary Bisbee (Analysts)】\nI guess, let me just first follow up on 2, quickly, on 2 questions that were asked earlier, and probably too many people are asking about the lease/consortiums. But if you continue to grow that as a percent of the mix, at some point in the future, does this make the business at all more volatile, like if the economy turns down, given that those sheets [ph] aren't all accounted for? Or is that really you're not expecting that much different than the rest of the mature base?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Lissy (Executives)】\nWell, I think, Gary, to a degree -- I mean obviously, the place where we're more vulnerable in a downturn when you look at the sort of overall portfolio of the business is the centers in which we have P&L responsibility for, and that's what we experienced in 2008, 2009, '10 time frame in that class. I think that the key for us is that the centers, obviously, combine both community, back-up and corporate sponsorship in them. So we're not -- we still remain, I think, with this model less exposed than sort of a straight retail model would because of the corporate sponsorship and because of the back-up business. And again, I think we'll continue to grow other models, too. So maybe on the margin slightly. But I still think many of the -- I would still anticipate that overall, the way the company performed during the last downturn is probably indicative of what we might expect, should we experience something similar in the future.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gary Bisbee (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then, on the whole universal pre-K concept, you talked about Georgia and Florida. Can you just give us a commentary, are your margins the same despite probably getting the lower state fees for part of the week, as they are in the rest of the business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Lissy (Executives)】\nYes, I think our margins are in line in those states with the rest of the business. I think, again, the key there is that we are wrapping around whatever the reimbursement is in those places in order to complete essentially a view of what our tuitions would average in those areas when we take what's paid for, what we -- sort of what's subsidized or what the parents would have to pay to wrap around for care for whatever hours they're going to wrap around.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gary Bisbee (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then, just last one on -- any updated thoughts on leverage and the leverage target? I know you brought the leverage down a lot with the IPO. It hasn't come down a lot since then, obviously, with you investing all of your cash flows through the M&A and the internal investment. But would you be comfortable just having the leverage come down going forward, just from the growth of your cash flow and continue to invest all of excess cash flow? Or any thoughts on how we might think about it over the next couple of years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Lissy (Executives)】\nYes, I'll let Elizabeth, in a second, Gary, comment on the specifics of kind of what we see on that and what we expect in '14. But I would say broadly that we believe that first and foremost, to the degree we can find acquisitions and/or new center of growth opportunities that meet our investment thresholds or return thresholds, that's probably the best way we can drive value for everybody with the cash that we generate in the business. To the degree that we're in a situation in the future -- and that's what happened this year, we were able to do that, essentially deploy all of our cash, end with a little bit of cash, but not much and not really have anything on the revolver. And we did see some modest deleveraging just with growth. We'll continue to see that, as Elizabeth can add color to. But I think going forward, if we find ourselves with the sort of high-class problem of not -- having too much cash that we generate, more so than we can invest with good investments back in the business, then I think we would look at the 3 options that would exist there, whether that be a dividend, a buyback plan or paying down some debt. The caveat on paying down the debt is we feel very good at the 4% rate that we have now, that that's a pretty -- it's efficient. It's efficient for us at that level. So if it stayed that way going forward, it would be more likely that our choice would be either a buyback or a dividend.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elizabeth Boland (Executives)】\nYes, I agree and I think that we're ending the year at under 4% or 3.75% without even considering the full year contribution that we would get from the acquisitions that done mid-year. So by the end of this year, we'll be close to 3 turns on our adjusted EBITDA, and we feel like that's very comfortable to just continue to grow into it with our natural -- the natural deleveraging that occurs there for the short foreseeable future.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Silber (Analysts)】\nJust a real quick one. Elizabeth, that $29 million, you mentioned in acquired revenues, was that all of the full-service center segment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elizabeth Boland (Executives)】\nYes, it is. And I just -- to clarify a question that came through earlier, so our back-up in that advisory growth in the quarter was a neighborhood of 1.5%. And so full-service organic growth is just over 7% growth, and then there's closures against that, that bring it down to around 5%. So that was just the full service on business, not the other organic growth. So I think that we're out of time.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Lissy (Executives)】\nI agree. Yes. Appreciate everybody's time. And thanks for the questions, and we'll be talking to you, I'm sure, in the near future. Have a good night.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Elizabeth Boland (Executives)】\nThank you.",

      "transcript_text1": "Good morning to all the participants in this webcast conference call regarding Inditex results for fiscal 2013. I am Pablo Isla, and here with me are Ignacio Fernández, CFO; and Marcus Lopez, Capital Markets Director. \r\nThe results for 2013 show the global reach of our business model. Inditex continues its ongoing multi-concept, multichannel growth. We operate a highly diversified business platform with a strong growth potential. \r\n2013 has been a year of strong expansion for Inditex. We have achieved satisfactory sales growth. The year has been marked by a tight control of operating expenses and significant investment in the expansion of our business through the addition of prime retail space globally. \r\nOur financial performance allows us to propose a significant increase in shareholder remuneration for fiscal 2013. We have finished the year with operations on 5 continents through 8 formats, 6,340 stores globally, and an online sales presence in the most relevant markets. We have reinforced significantly the differentiation of our key global flagships. We start 2014 with a unique platform that can access growth opportunities globally. \r\nI would like to highlight some key points of these results. In 2013, Inditex continued expanding its operations in a very significant way. Like-for-like sales grew strongly at 3%, on a very demanding comparable of 6%. Additionally, space growth was plus 9%, in line with long-term targets. We are also operating an online platform in 25 markets with a wide geographical coverage. We have also increased the prominence of our key global flagships, and have achieved a strong differentiation of our retail base. Additionally, the Board of Directors is proposing a 10% increase in the dividend to be paid in relation to this result. \r\nLet me now hand over to Ignacio, who will provide you with some detail behind the headline numbers, and I will join you later for the outlook section.\n\n---\n\nIn 2013, Inditex achieved net sales of EUR 16.7 billion, EBITDA of  EUR 3.9 billion, and net income of EUR 2.4 billion. I would like to highlight that all the lines of the profit and loss account, showed double-digit growth rates on a 2-year compound basis. The regional sales has been satisfactory, with 8% growth in our local currencies. These numbers have been achieved against very demanding comparables. \r\nSales growth is 10% on a 2-year compound basis. Like-for-like sales grew strongly of 3% in 2013, retail space increased 9%. Space contribution, adjusted for the store optimization program, was 7%. The translation of sales in currencies different to the euro has deducted 3 percentage point from reported sales. \r\nReported sales growth reflects the strong comparable currency translation and store optimization program. Over 2015, Inditex's retail space grew 9% to 3.4 million square meters. We have seen a strong expansion of our selling area and prime locations. We have added 281,000 square meters of space to our retail base over the year. The ongoing expansion of our group have led to a global sales platform, with a presence in 87 markets on 5 continents, both in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere. \r\nRegarding the gross margin, we can say that we are satisfied with the evolution in 2013.  Inditex gross profit increased 4% to EUR 9.9 billion. The gross margin has reached 59.3% of sales, as a result of the solid performance, flexible business model and sustained commercial policies. \r\nOperating expenses are tightly under control. They have grown 7% in the year, reflecting the strong like-for-like sales performance, and the significant addition of new retail space. This line includes all the start up cost for new space and the rollout of online sales. All the components of working capital continued to show tight control, reflecting the flexibility of the business model. \r\nIn 2013, funds from operations reached EUR 2.9 billion. I would like to highlight the strong investment made in 2013 in order to ensure future growth. Capital expenditure was EUR 1.24 billion, and it is continues to show a strong financial position. Net cash is EUR 4 billion. 2 important investments over 2013 have been development of the product department of Zara and Zara Home, Arteixo, La Coruña and the new distribution center for Pull&Bear in Cabanillas, Guadalajara.  I will now hand over to Marcos, who will further share the details further into the performance of the concepts.\n\n---\n\nGrowing the capacity of a business model to reach global growth opportunities, Inditex has opened stores in 61 markets over the year to reach 6,340 stores worldwide. Over 2013, the concept has increased the sales platform and deepen their global penetration. As you can see in this chart, Zara continues to represent approximately 2/3 of Inditex's sales, while the younger concepts account for 1/3. \r\nZara sales in 2013, reached EUR 10.8 billion and EBIT EUR 2.1 billion. On a 2-year compound basis, both lines grew 10%. The store optimization program for Zara was largely completed in 2013. Reported numbers reflect the strong comparable, currency translation of the store optimization program. Taking as a whole, the concepts  have grown sales of 10% over the year. Regarding the younger concepts, I would like to highlight the strong progress made by Zara Home, Massimo Dutti, Pull&Bear and Oysho over the year. \r\nI will now hand over to Pablo for the outlook section.\n\n---\n\nBefore closing, I would like to elaborate on the number of strategic points. In 2013, Inditex added 281,000 square meters of retail surface to reach 3.4 million square meters. This builds on very strong growth in space over recent years. In total, we have added 1.1 million square meters of prime retail space to our commercial base in just 4 years. Inditex online operations have seen a rapid rollout in recent years. Our business model allows a swift expansion of our online sales platform globally. The different launches have allowed us to cover practically the whole of the Northern Hemisphere in just 48 months. This presence provides a base for strong growth. We will continue to roll out online sales progressively in all the markets in which we are present with the stores. \r\nOver 2012, 2014, we have continued to increase the differentiation of our retail proposition. We have enlarged or refurbished most of our key global flagships, and are rolling out the new image into all new openings. The average size of new stores has also increased. This program is now largely completed and we are starting to see the results. \r\nAs you can see, our business model that combines stores and online is highly productive. In 2013, we have achieved a strong like-for-like of 3%, on very demanding comparables in the previous years. Let me point out that over the last 4 years, like-for-like sales growth has been 17%. We believe that Inditex is in an excellent position to take advantage of global growth opportunities. We have a strong potential to continue expanding profitably in the coming years. \r\nIn Europe, we continue to see huge growth opportunities in both Western and Eastern Europe. It is an area of growth for all our formats and we have an online sales presence in 21 markets. We see great potential to continue expanding profitably in Europe. \r\nIn Asia, our priority is to leverage the strong presence we have established over recent years. Asia accounts today for 20% of Inditex sales. Our expansion has been remarkable due to the excellent reception of our business proposition focused on the latest fashions and the fact that many of the markets are experiencing transformation. We currently enjoy a very strong position in all the key markets of the region. We are following a multi-concept and an online sales expansion strategy in Asia. \r\nWe see a strong long-term potential for Inditex in Asia markets. We also see a strong growth opportunities in the Americas, with a number of attractive growth markets. We are following a multi-concept and on online sales expansion strategy in the Americas. \r\nMassimo Dutti has launched in the U.S. and Canada. Stradivarius has been ruled out in Mexico and Zara Home in Brazil. In the United States, we are growing through a strong combination of very prominent flagships stores and online. We have continued expanding Zara in Australia and South Africa over 2013, confirming the global reach of our business model. We will continue to add new stores in both markets over the current year. \r\nInditex's online operations have seen a very rapid roll out in recent years. Our business model allows a swift expansion of our online sales platform globally. \r\nZara has built an online sales presence in 21 European markets, the U.S., Canada, Japan and China. The concepts also have an established online sales presence in Europe. Additionally, some of the concepts launched in the United States in 2012, where we continue to roll out online sales progressively in all the markets in which we are present with the stores. \r\nOur key step in this direction will be the launch of online sales in South Korea, Mexico in the Autumn-Winter season of this coming year. 2014 will be another year of a strong expansion for Inditex. We expect the space growth and conversion rates to be in line with our long-term targets. We plan to open 450 to 500 stores and to absorb 80 to 100 small units, mainly of non-Zara concepts into neighboring stores.  Capital expenditure for the year will be around EUR 1.35 billion. \r\nRegarding shareholder remuneration, the Board of Directors will propose at the General Shareholders Meeting a 10% increase in the dividend for fiscal 2013 to EUR 2.42 per share. This means the dividend per share has more than doubled since 2009. The total dividend payment amounts to EUR 1.5 billion. \r\nFinally, let me tell you that the store sales in local currencies have increased 12% from the 1st of February to the 15th of March 2014. As you all know, the Spring-Summer season is influenced by the performance over the Easter period due to its significant sales volumes. And this is all from us, we will be pleased now to answer any questions you may have.",

The ongoing expansion of our group have led to a global sales platform, with a presence in 87 markets on 5 continents, both in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere. \r\nRegarding the gross margin, we can say that we are satisfied with the evolution in 2013.  Inditex gross profit increased 4% to EUR 9.9 billion. The gross margin has reached 59.3% of sales, as a result of the solid performance, flexible business model and sustained commercial policies. \r\nOperating expenses are tightly under control. They have grown 7% in the year, reflecting the strong like-for-like sales performance, and the significant addition of new retail space. This line includes all the start up cost for new space and the rollout of online sales. All the components of working capital continued to show tight control, reflecting the flexibility of the business model. \r\nIn 2013, funds from operations reached EUR 2.9 billion. I would like to highlight the strong investment made in 2013 in order to ensure future growth. Capital expenditure was EUR 1.24 billion, and it is continues to show a strong financial position. Net cash is EUR 4 billion. 2 important investments over 2013 have been development of the product department of Zara and Zara Home, Arteixo, La Coruña and the new distribution center for Pull&Bear in Cabanillas, Guadalajara.  I will now hand over to Marcos, who will further share the details further into the performance of the concepts.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Marcos García (Executives)】\nGrowing the capacity of a business model to reach global growth opportunities, Inditex has opened stores in 61 markets over the year to reach 6,340 stores worldwide. Over 2013, the concept has increased the sales platform and deepen their global penetration. As you can see in this chart, Zara continues to represent approximately 2/3 of Inditex's sales, while the younger concepts account for 1/3. \r\nZara sales in 2013, reached EUR 10.8 billion and EBIT EUR 2.1 billion. On a 2-year compound basis, both lines grew 10%. The store optimization program for Zara was largely completed in 2013. Reported numbers reflect the strong comparable, currency translation of the store optimization program. Taking as a whole, the concepts  have grown sales of 10% over the year. Regarding the younger concepts, I would like to highlight the strong progress made by Zara Home, Massimo Dutti, Pull&Bear and Oysho over the year. \r\nI will now hand over to Pablo for the outlook section.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nBefore closing, I would like to elaborate on the number of strategic points. In 2013, Inditex added 281,000 square meters of retail surface to reach 3.4 million square meters. This builds on very strong growth in space over recent years. In total, we have added 1.1 million square meters of prime retail space to our commercial base in just 4 years. Inditex online operations have seen a rapid rollout in recent years. Our business model allows a swift expansion of our online sales platform globally. The different launches have allowed us to cover practically the whole of the Northern Hemisphere in just 48 months. This presence provides a base for strong growth. We will continue to roll out online sales progressively in all the markets in which we are present with the stores. \r\nOver 2012, 2014, we have continued to increase the differentiation of our retail proposition. We have enlarged or refurbished most of our key global flagships, and are rolling out the new image into all new openings. The average size of new stores has also increased. This program is now largely completed and we are starting to see the results. \r\nAs you can see, our business model that combines stores and online is highly productive. In 2013, we have achieved a strong like-for-like of 3%, on very demanding comparables in the previous years. Let me point out that over the last 4 years, like-for-like sales growth has been 17%. We believe that Inditex is in an excellent position to take advantage of global growth opportunities. We have a strong potential to continue expanding profitably in the coming years. \r\nIn Europe, we continue to see huge growth opportunities in both Western and Eastern Europe. It is an area of growth for all our formats and we have an online sales presence in 21 markets. We see great potential to continue expanding profitably in Europe. \r\nIn Asia, our priority is to leverage the strong presence we have established over recent years. Asia accounts today for 20% of Inditex sales. Our expansion has been remarkable due to the excellent reception of our business proposition focused on the latest fashions and the fact that many of the markets are experiencing transformation. We currently enjoy a very strong position in all the key markets of the region. We are following a multi-concept and an online sales expansion strategy in Asia. \r\nWe see a strong long-term potential for Inditex in Asia markets. We also see a strong growth opportunities in the Americas, with a number of attractive growth markets. We are following a multi-concept and on online sales expansion strategy in the Americas. \r\nMassimo Dutti has launched in the U.S. and Canada. Stradivarius has been ruled out in Mexico and Zara Home in Brazil. In the United States, we are growing through a strong combination of very prominent flagships stores and online. We have continued expanding Zara in Australia and South Africa over 2013, confirming the global reach of our business model. We will continue to add new stores in both markets over the current year. \r\nInditex's online operations have seen a very rapid roll out in recent years. Our business model allows a swift expansion of our online sales platform globally. \r\nZara has built an online sales presence in 21 European markets, the U.S., Canada, Japan and China. The concepts also have an established online sales presence in Europe. Additionally, some of the concepts launched in the United States in 2012, where we continue to roll out online sales progressively in all the markets in which we are present with the stores. \r\nOur key step in this direction will be the launch of online sales in South Korea, Mexico in the Autumn-Winter season of this coming year. 2014 will be another year of a strong expansion for Inditex. We expect the space growth and conversion rates to be in line with our long-term targets. We plan to open 450 to 500 stores and to absorb 80 to 100 small units, mainly of non-Zara concepts into neighboring stores.  Capital expenditure for the year will be around EUR 1.35 billion. \r\nRegarding shareholder remuneration, the Board of Directors will propose at the General Shareholders Meeting a 10% increase in the dividend for fiscal 2013 to EUR 2.42 per share. This means the dividend per share has more than doubled since 2009. The total dividend payment amounts to EUR 1.5 billion. \r\nFinally, let me tell you that the store sales in local currencies have increased 12% from the 1st of February to the 15th of March 2014. As you all know, the Spring-Summer season is influenced by the performance over the Easter period due to its significant sales volumes. And this is all from us, we will be pleased now to answer any questions you may have.",
      "transcript_text3": "I have a question on the currencies and refurbishment, which both weighed on 2013. Could you explain us, how these negative factors would play in 2014 versus 2013? Would there be less of an impact according to you from the refurbishment in particular. Can you help us a little bit with these metrics?\n\n---\n\nThe first thing, I would like to say is that refurbishments are not our negative factor. They have an impact on the P&L, but it's very, very positive for the company on this effort we are making regarding refurbishments. Answering your question, first of all, about currencies, at this moment of the year, our current exchange rate, currency impact in 2014 would be very similar to currency impact in 2013, with a bigger impact on the first half than on the second half. And regarding refurbishments say, what we were saying during the presentation is that the store optimization plan, which I say again, is very positive for the company for the long-term prospects of the company. Of course, during the last year, it has had an impact because a lot of the stores have been refurbished during the year, and then these stores have been closed for 3 or 4 months period during the year. What we can say now is that we expect in the year of 2014, conversion rates to be totally in line with long-term trends. So most of the effort has been already made in the year 2013.\n\n---\n\nI'm just wondering if you could quantify what the negative impact on the space growth line was from the store refurbishment. Because if you could say -- tell us that it was 2%, then we could strip that out and work out the underlying productivity rate.\n\n---\n\nAnne, what we have mentioned in the space growth for the year was 9%, very much in line with targets. We also qualified the underlying space conversion rate was around 7%. So I think this is mostly the impact that you could see coming from the store optimization plan. Yes, you mentioned something around 2 percentage points. I think, this is reasonable assumption.\n\n---\n\nQuestion on OpEx, please. I wonder if you could state, what the OpEx growth in the fourth quarter was in local currency. I think, it was up about 8% overall, but what was the number in local currency. And then maybe say, why that succeeded space growth in the quarter, given presumably there was less space optimization work going on during the quarter compared to Q3?\n\n---\n\nWell, you know that we like to analyze OpEx growth on a full-year basis. We always say that analyzing OpEx growth on a quarterly basis could -- we prefer to analyze it on a full-year basis. From that point of view, OpEx growth is 7%, currency impact regarding OpEx is 50% of the impact on sales. So in any case, OpEx growth in local currencies is below space growth. This means that like-for-like OpEx growth has been very, very much under control. And we can say that we consider, we have had good performance in terms of OpEx growth during the year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So the OpEx growth in local currency was about 9% for the full year, is that right? Or it's just under?\n\n---\n\nWell, it's 8.5% -- around 8.5%, yes.\n\n---\n\n8.5%, okay.\n\n---\n\nJust noted your comment before around currency translation impact for the coming year being in line with 2013. Could you say or give us some indication as to how you think that might at this early stage impact gross margin? I mean, I know, you always say plus or minus 50 basis points is stable, but ultimately, you are broadly exporting euro denominated product to some of these territories, and I appreciate, there are many, many commercial considerations. But I just wanted to -- how you think that might affect gross margin at this early stage in the year?\n\n---\n\nIn your question, you were making, I would say, all the relevant comments. You know that we always say that the gross margins are combination of many different things. It has to do with that like-for-like sales growth, with fashion trends, with markups, mark downs, it has to do with many different things, of course, currencies are one of these things. What we can say, at the beginning of the year, is that we're thinking about the stable gross margin during the year. But as far as the gross margin, it's not mathematics, so we always say that they stable for us, means plus-minus 50 basis points. You have seen that in the second half of the year, the gross margin has been stable. And having in mind our concept of a stable  also in the full year, the gross margin has been broadly, broadly stable. So what we can say for 2014, at the beginning of the year, is that we are thinking about the stable gross margin for the full year, having in mind all the different elements.\n\n---\n\nOkay, but am I right in understanding that at least in terms of currency, a negative translation impact for you, all else being equal, would mean a negative gross margin impact as well?\n\n---\n\nWell, yes, but the gross margin is a combination of many different things. So that is why, we always say that why so late, one particular factor is not the best approach because it has to do, of course, with currencies, but it also has to do with many, many other different elements, as I was mentioning to you. If you remember previous presentation, when we have a strong like-for-like, this helps a lot the gross margin, but there are many, many things involved in the gross margin. That is what why -- what we can say at this moment, at the beginning of the year, is that we're thinking about the stable gross margin for the full year.\n\n---\n\nCould you help us out with how many stores you closed or absorbed in 2013, please?\n\n---\n\nYes, it was 188, finally.\n\n---\n\nYes 188, was that?\n\n---\n\nIt is what we anticipated to you in the month of December, that was going to happen in the full year. So we have a slightly more than 500 gross openings during the year.\n\n---\n\nMy question is actually is about the online business. And I was wondering, I can see that you're still trialing Pull&Bear through the Atos website. And I was wondering if you could explain the rationale, what you gain and would you consider doing that with either other pure play e-commerce, retailers or with other Zara brands?\n\n---\n\nSorry, but it was impossible to hear you. There was a lot of noise in the line.\n\n---\n\nMy question is about online.\n\n---\n\nOnline?\n\n---\n\nYes, and you're selling Pull&Bear through Atos. Can you explain the rationale, whether you'd consider doing it with other pure play e-commerce retailers? And whether you consider it doing it with other brands?\n\n---\n\nI don't know if I have understood properly your question, but I think so because the sound, there's a noise. But mainly, we prefer to sell online through our own web pages. That is what we are doing in 99% of the cases. And we would make, from time to time, some exceptions with 1 or 2 particular brands in 1 or 2 geographies. But our main approach is to sell online through our own web pages. Online for us is extremely relevant. As you know, online for us is relevant from 2 different point of view, as we always say, of course, it has to do with online sales and online sales growth. And then it also has to do with a very, very relevant way for us to communicate with our customers. Today, on average, we are close to 5 million visits to our web pages all across the world everyday. So this is a very, very relevant way for us to communicate to our customers, the new environments that we are presenting online and sending to our stores, the look books, the coordination. So online is very, very relevant for us from these 2 different points of view, and our main approach is to sell online through our own web pages.\n\n---\n\nThe question on space, please. First, could you give us the time weighted space growth in the year just gone versus the number you gave us in the past. And secondly, you opened 61 stores net in China last year. Is that a reasonable run rate for the year ahead?\n\n---\n\nWell, regarding operating space growth, it's always on a 2-year basis, very similar to the space growth we are presenting. So not big differences thinking about average space growth and space growth figure. Regarding China, what I would like to say is that China, for us, is very relevant. As you know, we have more than 450 stores at the end of the year with a very relevant number of Zara stores. So at the end of this year, we will be above 500 stores in China, we continue growing in a very significant way. This year, we have refurbished 2 of our main stores in China. What was our first store in Mainland China, which was the store in West Nanjing Road has been refurbished. And we will reopen this store in the month of September after the refurbishment. We also refurbished one of our most relevant stores in Beijing, The Place, also reopening it after the summer. So this has been a year of a strong activity in China with a lot of openings. This will continue being the case in the coming years. In China, as in other geographies, our growth is a combination between high-street locations, shopping malls and then in terms of the number of openings in one particular year, depending on the shopping mall developments, or if there is any delay or not, there would -- there would always be some movements of stores from one year to another. But I think, the relevant factor is that we continue seeing a strong growth potential in China. For us, we are very, very well appreciated by Chinese customers. Our online proposition is also been very, very well-received in China. So we feel very comfortable with the Chinese market from every point of view. And as I was saying to you, it will continue being a very relevant part of our expansion in terms of the specific number of stores of any particular year. There could be this type of changes, depending on the number of shopping mall developments in that given year. \r\nI would like also to tell you, talking also about China to make a reference to this big, big flagship that we are planning to open in Hong Kong in the coming months in central high-street location very, very prominent. This is going to be probably -- no, I would say this is going to be the most relevant opening of this year. The opening that we are planning to making in Hong Kong in the coming months. In Queens Road in Central, this is going to be a huge flagship. We are now working very hard with the works to prepare the store, and we are planning to open in the coming months.\n\n---\n\nSo could I just come back on the time weighted point. It was about a percentage lower than your space growth last year, are you saying that, that wasn't the case this year?\n\n---\n\nWhat we're saying is that this year in 2013, we have achieved 9% space growth. For 2013, we expect something very, very similar. So time weighted, they're not going to be relevant differences.\n\n---\n\nCould you just talk a little bit more about CapEx in terms of the varying components, whether there are any lumpy amounts in the for IT  projects or logistics. And the overall cost of CapEx compared with new space, you've added over the last 3 years, or so has gone up quite considerably. And I see that much of this is down to the flagship program. And yet, we're probably got similar escalation for the current year. Can you just talk a bit around the cost of these new stores? And whether when you move past the flagship program, the overall cost of new space will decline or stay flat?\n\n---\n\nWhat we were mentioning that when we think about CapEx and particularly in one year, such as the last year, the year 2013. You must have in mind, of course, the openings. We have opened more than 500 stores during the year. You heard, you must have in mind the refurbishments. We have refurbished during the year, a very, very significant number of flagships, as we have been mentioning during the quarterly results presentation. And then, of course, we'll have all the remaining CapEx, which has to do with logistics. We are building our logistic platform, a very relevant logistic platform, near Madrid. So we built the logistic platform for Massimo Dutti also the enlargement of our headquarters for Zara and for Zara Home. So you must have in mind all the different elements. In terms of CapEx, per store or per square meters, there are big differences compared to previous trends. So you should assume CapEx in general terms to grow in line with the space growth.\n\n---\n\nRight, I was slightly surprised of the overall annual growth for 2014, is in line with space growth, when you talked about so many lumpy arms within 2013. Will any of that growth often subsequent year [indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nYes, but in 2014, we are paying most of this new logistic platform that we are building outside Madrid, which is very relevant.\n\n---\n\nRight. And just one final question on logistics platform. Are you any further to, in terms of your thinking about potentially putting a logistics platform into Asia?\n\n---\n\nNo, no. We have -- at this stage, we are not thinking about any of that. So with the current logistic platform that we have, we think, we have enough capacity for the coming years, and we have not thinking about anything like that.\n\n---\n\nJust a couple of questions. Firstly, can you confirm that the store that has been refurbed, cannot fall into the like-for-like now for -- over the course of program, 24 months.\n\n---\n\nCan you please repeat your question, Rebecca?\n\n---\n\nThe stores that have been refurbed or enlarged ex cetera, they don't fall back into the like-for-like calculation for 24 months, is that right?\n\n---\n\nThat's correct in 24 months.\n\n---\n\nSo basically, any impact will be necessarily new space contribution.\n\n---\n\nThat's correct.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then looking at the underlying space contribution in 2013 of 7%, only 8.8% in new space that applies to self conversion ratio of like 75%, 76%. Is that the longer-term target that you're referring to in the comments, vis–à–vis, outlet?\n\n---\n\nYes, that's right, that's in the presentation. We mentioned that the underlying space below of about 7% because this year, we have one main effect that distorts the number, which is the space conversion. And with the store optimization plan lastly completed, you should expect conversion rates to revert to historical average.\n\n---\n\nIn the region of 75%, right?\n\n---\n\nYes,  it's around 70%.\n\n---\n\nIt's okay. And then finally, in terms of the moment when the stores are being refurbed, this 3 to 4 months closures. I'm assuming that the focus of the OpEx is still being laid down right? With perhaps say, the exception of staffing costs.\n\n---\n\nThat's correct, I mean, you're still paying for rents and for salaries, so you're still incurring in the OpEx. This is why we've mentioned during the presentation that the management of operating space has been extremely tight.\n\n---\n\nSo is there any information as to the operating hit from rather than just revenues in terms of profitability to hit from the refurbs from the non-profit cost?\n\n---\n\nCan you please repeat the question. It was not -- your line is not very clear.\n\n---\n\nSorry, I am on the different line this time. Is there any estimation as to the EBIT impact from the non-covered costs, non-covered costs given the closures?\n\n---\n\nNo, we don't expect anything relevant, Rebecca.\n\n---\n\nThe question is on the price positioning of Zara mainly, but also all for the group. Would you tell us into next year if you still plan to have a stable pricing that you have mentioned in the past? And within the same question, whether now you feel that need to grow your budget chain left is at all?\n\n---\n\nWell, in general terms, we will maintain a stable prices in the different geographies. There could be some exceptions to this general, I would say, rule. But in general terms, we will maintain stable prices in the different markets. You know that we are in the markets always for the long term. You know that our proposition to our customer has to do with very high fashion, high quality and affordable prices. And thinking always not about the short term, but thinking always about the medium and the long-term presence in the different markets. So that is why, globally, our approach is going to maintain a stable pricing policy in the different markets. As I was saying to you, there can be exceptions here or there, but the general rule will be stable prices.\n\n---\n\nAnd do you see more opportunities to improve your fashion mix? Or you think, you've reached the level, where your fashion mix and pricing is now the right one?\n\n---\n\nWell, you must -- you can see the like-for-like sales growth evolution. This is the most relevant -- in terms of figures, this is the relevant figure regarding that. So there is always -- we are always trying to improve, but the result of that is like-for-like sales growth.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And lastly, would you be able to tell us what online could trigger like-for-like the year that just passed?\n\n---\n\nAs you know, for the moment, we prefer not to do that because our feel is that online and the stores operations are totally integrated. This is why we have been able to launch online, so swiftly and covering the whole of Northern Hemisphere. We will be in 27 countries by the end of the year. Online is a strong engine of growth, the same as the stores. I would like to highlight again, that over the last 4 years, like-for-like compound growth was 17%. So clearly, the company is extremely productive. And online comes very, very natural to us. So for the moment, this is the way forward to launch the stores in a significant way, to launch online operations, and we believe that the growth opportunity is huge.\n\n---\n\nMy question is related to the selling area contribution this first weeks of 2014. So sales in local currency increased by 12% in the first week, which compares with 8% last year. You mentioned that this year, we should expect the normalization of the selling area contribution to historical average. My question is, if this was already the case in Q1, so if this 12% sales increase in local currency already assume a normalization of selling area contribution to sales?\n\n---\n\nYes, what I would tell you is that, of course, the trading update, we are talking about 12% sales growth from 1st of February to the 15th of March, but this is just the start of the year. And I mean, we have the whole Spring-Summer season in front of us, we have the whole Autumn-Winter season in front of us. And so, what we can say it's our strongest  start of the year. And then all the guidelines that we're providing in this full year result presentation, regarding all these guidelines, we are thinking about the full year. So what we are seeing is that the space growth will be in line with this 8% to 10% range. And conversion rates will be in line with the average trends of the group. So this is what we are expecting. And regarding currencies, we were saying that at this stage of the year, at current exchange rates, currency impact will be very similar to the one we have seen in the year 2013. And will have bigger impact in the first half than in the second half. So this is what we would like to say about the trading update and the our view for the year as a whole.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Just to confirm, so the sales, the selling area contribution, so eventually in this Q1 will still below the average for the year, right?\n\n---\n\nNo, I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is that we never like to enter into an analysis of 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 2 weeks. We prefer to think about the full year, and particularly full year results presentation.\n\n---\n\nJust a couple of quick follow-ups if I may. Just wanted, first of all, in the cash flow statement and other assets investments, what that relates to and why that's up so much, please?\n\n---\n\nCan you repeat the question, Richard?\n\n---\n\nYes, Marcos. It's in the cash flow statement, you put a line called Other asset investments. So I was just wondering why that's up so much, and what that relates to, EUR 142 million?\n\n---\n\nYes, this is the typical performance after a very strong year. If you remember, funds from operations grew 25% on 2012. Obviously, there are some payments that fall into the following year. This is mainly tax accounts and rentals related to turnover related events.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And my other one was just on Russia and Ukraine, obviously, I just wondered if you've seen any impact on sales from recent events there, please?\n\n---\n\nWe remain operating normal, in completely normal conditions.\n\n---\n\nGood morning, everybody. We are now going to go to through questions that have come in through webcast platform. We have a number of questions this morning. The first question is regarding United States. You mentioned during the presentation that you are doing a strong combination of flagships and online growth in the U.S. Can you give us some color on your activity in this market?\n\n---\n\nYes, what we're saying during the presentation in the United States, we are enjoying a strong growth due to this combination of relevant flagship stores and online. We have -- we are opening relevant flagships in the different United -- American cities. Recently, we have opened a very prominent store in Seattle. We have enlarged during the year of 2013, our store in Flatiron on Fifth Avenue. And in the coming months, we are planning to open in L.A., we are planning to open in Lincoln Road in Miami. A little bit later, we are planning to open this big flagship close to the World Trade Center. And at the same time, growing online. So within this combination between opening relevant flagships and growing online is a very good combination for our expansion in the U.S. market.\n\n---\n\nWe have another question about another geography, this time Spain. You spoken in recent conference calls about some more optimization in this market, has been this reflected in your performance in 2013?\n\n---\n\nWhat we can say -- well, you know that we do not like very much to talk about different geographies. But what we can say about the Spain is that in the second half of the year, we have achieved 3% sales growth in the Spanish market. And we expect this positive trend to continue during the year 2014.\n\n---\n\nWe have a question regarding Zara. Would you like to comment on your expectation for Zara in 2014?\n\n---\n\nWell, regarding Zara, what we can say is that Zara is a very relevant part of our company as you perfectly know. And regarding Zara, we have gone through this very relevant the store optimization plan, and we have big expectations for Zara in the year 2014 in terms of openings. We're opening very relevant flagships in the coming months. The first one is going to be a big opening in Madrid in Serrano Street that is going to take place on April 4. Then we are -- we have many relevant flagships for Zara in this year, but I would mention one in Zurich, this very, very relevant flagship in Hong Kong that we are planning to open or in Miami, Lincoln Road, in many different places. So within 2014, it will be a strong year for Zara.\n\n---\n\nWe have a question regarding your sourcing mix and do you envisage any change in the geographic mix of your sourcing?\n\n---\n\nYou know that for us, proximity sourcing is extremely relevant. We maintain a big part of our sourcing proximity because it is very much related with our business model. The ability to react during the season, the low level of commitment in terms of purchasing at any point in the season. So our idea is to continue managing our business model, and to maintain this very relevant part of our sourcing proximity.\n\n---\n\nOkay. That concludes the questions that come in from the webcast platform. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThank you very much. And, of course, we are ready to continue answering your questions through our Capital Markets Department. Thank you very much for joining us today. Goodbye.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Cedric Lecasble (Analysts)】\nI have a question on the currencies and refurbishment, which both weighed on 2013.

Can you help us a little bit with these metrics?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ignacio Izuzquiza Fernández (Executives)】\nThe first thing, I would like to say is that refurbishments are not our negative factor. They have an impact on the P&L, but it's very, very positive for the company on this effort we are making regarding refurbishments. Answering your question, first of all, about currencies, at this moment of the year, our current exchange rate, currency impact in 2014 would be very similar to currency impact in 2013, with a bigger impact on the first half than on the second half. And regarding refurbishments say, what we were saying during the presentation is that the store optimization plan, which I say again, is very positive for the company for the long-term prospects of the company. Of course, during the last year, it has had an impact because a lot of the stores have been refurbished during the year, and then these stores have been closed for 3 or 4 months period during the year. What we can say now is that we expect in the year of 2014, conversion rates to be totally in line with long-term trends. So most of the effort has been already made in the year 2013.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anne Critchlow (Analysts)】\nI'm just wondering if you could quantify what the negative impact on the space growth line was from the store refurbishment. Because if you could say -- tell us that it was 2%, then we could strip that out and work out the underlying productivity rate.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ignacio Izuzquiza Fernández (Executives)】\nAnne, what we have mentioned in the space growth for the year was 9%, very much in line with targets. We also qualified the underlying space conversion rate was around 7%. So I think this is mostly the impact that you could see coming from the store optimization plan. Yes, you mentioned something around 2 percentage points. I think, this is reasonable assumption.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Chamberlain (Analysts)】\nQuestion on OpEx, please. I wonder if you could state, what the OpEx growth in the fourth quarter was in local currency. I think, it was up about 8% overall, but what was the number in local currency. And then maybe say, why that succeeded space growth in the quarter, given presumably there was less space optimization work going on during the quarter compared to Q3?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, you know that we like to analyze OpEx growth on a full-year basis. We always say that analyzing OpEx growth on a quarterly basis could -- we prefer to analyze it on a full-year basis. From that point of view, OpEx growth is 7%, currency impact regarding OpEx is 50% of the impact on sales. So in any case, OpEx growth in local currencies is below space growth. This means that like-for-like OpEx growth has been very, very much under control. And we can say that we consider, we have had good performance in terms of OpEx growth during the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Chamberlain (Analysts)】\nOkay. So the OpEx growth in local currency was about 9% for the full year, is that right? Or it's just under?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, it's 8.5% -- around 8.5%, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Chamberlain (Analysts)】\n8.5%, okay.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nJust noted your comment before around currency translation impact for the coming year being in line with 2013. Could you say or give us some indication as to how you think that might at this early stage impact gross margin? I mean, I know, you always say plus or minus 50 basis points is stable, but ultimately, you are broadly exporting euro denominated product to some of these territories, and I appreciate, there are many, many commercial considerations. But I just wanted to -- how you think that might affect gross margin at this early stage in the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nIn your question, you were making, I would say, all the relevant comments. You know that we always say that the gross margins are combination of many different things. It has to do with that like-for-like sales growth, with fashion trends, with markups, mark downs, it has to do with many different things, of course, currencies are one of these things. What we can say, at the beginning of the year, is that we're thinking about the stable gross margin during the year. But as far as the gross margin, it's not mathematics, so we always say that they stable for us, means plus-minus 50 basis points. You have seen that in the second half of the year, the gross margin has been stable. And having in mind our concept of a stable  also in the full year, the gross margin has been broadly, broadly stable. So what we can say for 2014, at the beginning of the year, is that we are thinking about the stable gross margin for the full year, having in mind all the different elements.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nOkay, but am I right in understanding that at least in terms of currency, a negative translation impact for you, all else being equal, would mean a negative gross margin impact as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, yes, but the gross margin is a combination of many different things. So that is why, we always say that why so late, one particular factor is not the best approach because it has to do, of course, with currencies, but it also has to do with many, many other different elements, as I was mentioning to you. If you remember previous presentation, when we have a strong like-for-like, this helps a lot the gross margin, but there are many, many things involved in the gross margin. That is what why -- what we can say at this moment, at the beginning of the year, is that we're thinking about the stable gross margin for the full year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Geoff Lowery (Analysts)】\nCould you help us out with how many stores you closed or absorbed in 2013, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nYes, it was 188, finally.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Geoff Lowery (Analysts)】\nYes 188, was that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nIt is what we anticipated to you in the month of December, that was going to happen in the full year. So we have a slightly more than 500 gross openings during the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jamie Merriman (Analysts)】\nMy question is actually is about the online business. And I was wondering, I can see that you're still trialing Pull&Bear through the Atos website. And I was wondering if you could explain the rationale, what you gain and would you consider doing that with either other pure play e-commerce, retailers or with other Zara brands?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nSorry, but it was impossible to hear you. There was a lot of noise in the line.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jamie Merriman (Analysts)】\nMy question is about online.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nOnline?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jamie Merriman (Analysts)】\nYes, and you're selling Pull&Bear through Atos. Can you explain the rationale, whether you'd consider doing it with other pure play e-commerce retailers? And whether you consider it doing it with other brands?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nI don't know if I have understood properly your question, but I think so because the sound, there's a noise. But mainly, we prefer to sell online through our own web pages. That is what we are doing in 99% of the cases. And we would make, from time to time, some exceptions with 1 or 2 particular brands in 1 or 2 geographies. But our main approach is to sell online through our own web pages. Online for us is extremely relevant. As you know, online for us is relevant from 2 different point of view, as we always say, of course, it has to do with online sales and online sales growth. And then it also has to do with a very, very relevant way for us to communicate with our customers. Today, on average, we are close to 5 million visits to our web pages all across the world everyday. So this is a very, very relevant way for us to communicate to our customers, the new environments that we are presenting online and sending to our stores, the look books, the coordination. So online is very, very relevant for us from these 2 different points of view, and our main approach is to sell online through our own web pages.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Warwick Okines (Analysts)】\nThe question on space, please. First, could you give us the time weighted space growth in the year just gone versus the number you gave us in the past. And secondly, you opened 61 stores net in China last year. Is that a reasonable run rate for the year ahead?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, regarding operating space growth, it's always on a 2-year basis, very similar to the space growth we are presenting. So not big differences thinking about average space growth and space growth figure. Regarding China, what I would like to say is that China, for us, is very relevant. As you know, we have more than 450 stores at the end of the year with a very relevant number of Zara stores. So at the end of this year, we will be above 500 stores in China, we continue growing in a very significant way. This year, we have refurbished 2 of our main stores in China. What was our first store in Mainland China, which was the store in West Nanjing Road has been refurbished. And we will reopen this store in the month of September after the refurbishment. We also refurbished one of our most relevant stores in Beijing, The Place, also reopening it after the summer. So this has been a year of a strong activity in China with a lot of openings. This will continue being the case in the coming years. In China, as in other geographies, our growth is a combination between high-street locations, shopping malls and then in terms of the number of openings in one particular year, depending on the shopping mall developments, or if there is any delay or not, there would -- there would always be some movements of stores from one year to another. But I think, the relevant factor is that we continue seeing a strong growth potential in China. For us, we are very, very well appreciated by Chinese customers. Our online proposition is also been very, very well-received in China. So we feel very comfortable with the Chinese market from every point of view. And as I was saying to you, it will continue being a very relevant part of our expansion in terms of the specific number of stores of any particular year. There could be this type of changes, depending on the number of shopping mall developments in that given year. \r\nI would like also to tell you, talking also about China to make a reference to this big, big flagship that we are planning to open in Hong Kong in the coming months in central high-street location very, very prominent. This is going to be probably -- no, I would say this is going to be the most relevant opening of this year. The opening that we are planning to making in Hong Kong in the coming months. In Queens Road in Central, this is going to be a huge flagship. We are now working very hard with the works to prepare the store, and we are planning to open in the coming months.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Warwick Okines (Analysts)】\nSo could I just come back on the time weighted point. It was about a percentage lower than your space growth last year, are you saying that, that wasn't the case this year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ignacio Izuzquiza Fernández (Executives)】\nWhat we're saying is that this year in 2013, we have achieved 9% space growth. For 2013, we expect something very, very similar. So time weighted, they're not going to be relevant differences.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Irwin (Analysts)】\nCould you just talk a little bit more about CapEx in terms of the varying components, whether there are any lumpy amounts in the for IT  projects or logistics. And the overall cost of CapEx compared with new space, you've added over the last 3 years, or so has gone up quite considerably. And I see that much of this is down to the flagship program. And yet, we're probably got similar escalation for the current year. Can you just talk a bit around the cost of these new stores? And whether when you move past the flagship program, the overall cost of new space will decline or stay flat?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWhat we were mentioning that when we think about CapEx and particularly in one year, such as the last year, the year 2013. You must have in mind, of course, the openings. We have opened more than 500 stores during the year. You heard, you must have in mind the refurbishments. We have refurbished during the year, a very, very significant number of flagships, as we have been mentioning during the quarterly results presentation. And then, of course, we'll have all the remaining CapEx, which has to do with logistics. We are building our logistic platform, a very relevant logistic platform, near Madrid. So we built the logistic platform for Massimo Dutti also the enlargement of our headquarters for Zara and for Zara Home. So you must have in mind all the different elements. In terms of CapEx, per store or per square meters, there are big differences compared to previous trends. So you should assume CapEx in general terms to grow in line with the space growth.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Irwin (Analysts)】\nRight, I was slightly surprised of the overall annual growth for 2014, is in line with space growth, when you talked about so many lumpy arms within 2013. Will any of that growth often subsequent year [indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nYes, but in 2014, we are paying most of this new logistic platform that we are building outside Madrid, which is very relevant.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Irwin (Analysts)】\nRight. And just one final question on logistics platform. Are you any further to, in terms of your thinking about potentially putting a logistics platform into Asia?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nNo, no. We have -- at this stage, we are not thinking about any of that. So with the current logistic platform that we have, we think, we have enough capacity for the coming years, and we have not thinking about anything like that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nJust a couple of questions. Firstly, can you confirm that the store that has been refurbed, cannot fall into the like-for-like now for -- over the course of program, 24 months.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ignacio Izuzquiza Fernández (Executives)】\nCan you please repeat your question, Rebecca?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nThe stores that have been refurbed or enlarged ex cetera, they don't fall back into the like-for-like calculation for 24 months, is that right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ignacio Izuzquiza Fernández (Executives)】\nThat's correct in 24 months.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nSo basically, any impact will be necessarily new space contribution.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ignacio Izuzquiza Fernández (Executives)】\nThat's correct.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then looking at the underlying space contribution in 2013 of 7%, only 8.8% in new space that applies to self conversion ratio of like 75%, 76%. Is that the longer-term target that you're referring to in the comments, vis–à–vis, outlet?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ignacio Izuzquiza Fernández (Executives)】\nYes, that's right, that's in the presentation. We mentioned that the underlying space below of about 7% because this year, we have one main effect that distorts the number, which is the space conversion. And with the store optimization plan lastly completed, you should expect conversion rates to revert to historical average.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nIn the region of 75%, right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ignacio Izuzquiza Fernández (Executives)】\nYes,  it's around 70%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nIt's okay. And then finally, in terms of the moment when the stores are being refurbed, this 3 to 4 months closures. I'm assuming that the focus of the OpEx is still being laid down right? With perhaps say, the exception of staffing costs.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ignacio Izuzquiza Fernández (Executives)】\nThat's correct, I mean, you're still paying for rents and for salaries, so you're still incurring in the OpEx. This is why we've mentioned during the presentation that the management of operating space has been extremely tight.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nSo is there any information as to the operating hit from rather than just revenues in terms of profitability to hit from the refurbs from the non-profit cost?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ignacio Izuzquiza Fernández (Executives)】\nCan you please repeat the question. It was not -- your line is not very clear.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nSorry, I am on the different line this time. Is there any estimation as to the EBIT impact from the non-covered costs, non-covered costs given the closures?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ignacio Izuzquiza Fernández (Executives)】\nNo, we don't expect anything relevant, Rebecca.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nThe question is on the price positioning of Zara mainly, but also all for the group. Would you tell us into next year if you still plan to have a stable pricing that you have mentioned in the past? And within the same question, whether now you feel that need to grow your budget chain left is at all?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, in general terms, we will maintain a stable prices in the different geographies. There could be some exceptions to this general, I would say, rule. But in general terms, we will maintain stable prices in the different markets. You know that we are in the markets always for the long term. You know that our proposition to our customer has to do with very high fashion, high quality and affordable prices. And thinking always not about the short term, but thinking always about the medium and the long-term presence in the different markets. So that is why, globally, our approach is going to maintain a stable pricing policy in the different markets. As I was saying to you, there can be exceptions here or there, but the general rule will be stable prices.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nAnd do you see more opportunities to improve your fashion mix? Or you think, you've reached the level, where your fashion mix and pricing is now the right one?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, you must -- you can see the like-for-like sales growth evolution. This is the most relevant -- in terms of figures, this is the relevant figure regarding that. So there is always -- we are always trying to improve, but the result of that is like-for-like sales growth.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nOkay. And lastly, would you be able to tell us what online could trigger like-for-like the year that just passed?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ignacio Izuzquiza Fernández (Executives)】\nAs you know, for the moment, we prefer not to do that because our feel is that online and the stores operations are totally integrated. This is why we have been able to launch online, so swiftly and covering the whole of Northern Hemisphere. We will be in 27 countries by the end of the year. Online is a strong engine of growth, the same as the stores. I would like to highlight again, that over the last 4 years, like-for-like compound growth was 17%. So clearly, the company is extremely productive. And online comes very, very natural to us. So for the moment, this is the way forward to launch the stores in a significant way, to launch online operations, and we believe that the growth opportunity is huge.\n\n---\n\n【質問: José Rito (Analysts)】\nMy question is related to the selling area contribution this first weeks of 2014. So sales in local currency increased by 12% in the first week, which compares with 8% last year. You mentioned that this year, we should expect the normalization of the selling area contribution to historical average. My question is, if this was already the case in Q1, so if this 12% sales increase in local currency already assume a normalization of selling area contribution to sales?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nYes, what I would tell you is that, of course, the trading update, we are talking about 12% sales growth from 1st of February to the 15th of March, but this is just the start of the year. And I mean, we have the whole Spring-Summer season in front of us, we have the whole Autumn-Winter season in front of us. And so, what we can say it's our strongest  start of the year. And then all the guidelines that we're providing in this full year result presentation, regarding all these guidelines, we are thinking about the full year. So what we are seeing is that the space growth will be in line with this 8% to 10% range. And conversion rates will be in line with the average trends of the group. So this is what we are expecting. And regarding currencies, we were saying that at this stage of the year, at current exchange rates, currency impact will be very similar to the one we have seen in the year 2013. And will have bigger impact in the first half than in the second half. So this is what we would like to say about the trading update and the our view for the year as a whole.\n\n---\n\n【質問: José Rito (Analysts)】\nOkay. Just to confirm, so the sales, the selling area contribution, so eventually in this Q1 will still below the average for the year, right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nNo, I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is that we never like to enter into an analysis of 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 2 weeks. We prefer to think about the full year, and particularly full year results presentation.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Chamberlain (Analysts)】\nJust a couple of quick follow-ups if I may. Just wanted, first of all, in the cash flow statement and other assets investments, what that relates to and why that's up so much, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Marcos García (Executives)】\nCan you repeat the question, Richard?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Chamberlain (Analysts)】\nYes, Marcos. It's in the cash flow statement, you put a line called Other asset investments. So I was just wondering why that's up so much, and what that relates to, EUR 142 million?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Marcos García (Executives)】\nYes, this is the typical performance after a very strong year. If you remember, funds from operations grew 25% on 2012. Obviously, there are some payments that fall into the following year. This is mainly tax accounts and rentals related to turnover related events.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Chamberlain (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And my other one was just on Russia and Ukraine, obviously, I just wondered if you've seen any impact on sales from recent events there, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWe remain operating normal, in completely normal conditions.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nGood morning, everybody. We are now going to go to through questions that have come in through webcast platform. We have a number of questions this morning. The first question is regarding United States. You mentioned during the presentation that you are doing a strong combination of flagships and online growth in the U.S. Can you give us some color on your activity in this market?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nYes, what we're saying during the presentation in the United States, we are enjoying a strong growth due to this combination of relevant flagship stores and online. We have -- we are opening relevant flagships in the different United -- American cities. Recently, we have opened a very prominent store in Seattle. We have enlarged during the year of 2013, our store in Flatiron on Fifth Avenue. And in the coming months, we are planning to open in L.A., we are planning to open in Lincoln Road in Miami. A little bit later, we are planning to open this big flagship close to the World Trade Center. And at the same time, growing online. So within this combination between opening relevant flagships and growing online is a very good combination for our expansion in the U.S. market.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nWe have another question about another geography, this time Spain. You spoken in recent conference calls about some more optimization in this market, has been this reflected in your performance in 2013?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWhat we can say -- well, you know that we do not like very much to talk about different geographies. But what we can say about the Spain is that in the second half of the year, we have achieved 3% sales growth in the Spanish market. And we expect this positive trend to continue during the year 2014.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nWe have a question regarding Zara. Would you like to comment on your expectation for Zara in 2014?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, regarding Zara, what we can say is that Zara is a very relevant part of our company as you perfectly know. And regarding Zara, we have gone through this very relevant the store optimization plan, and we have big expectations for Zara in the year 2014 in terms of openings. We're opening very relevant flagships in the coming months. The first one is going to be a big opening in Madrid in Serrano Street that is going to take place on April 4. Then we are -- we have many relevant flagships for Zara in this year, but I would mention one in Zurich, this very, very relevant flagship in Hong Kong that we are planning to open or in Miami, Lincoln Road, in many different places. So within 2014, it will be a strong year for Zara.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nWe have a question regarding your sourcing mix and do you envisage any change in the geographic mix of your sourcing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nYou know that for us, proximity sourcing is extremely relevant. We maintain a big part of our sourcing proximity because it is very much related with our business model. The ability to react during the season, the low level of commitment in terms of purchasing at any point in the season. So our idea is to continue managing our business model, and to maintain this very relevant part of our sourcing proximity.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nOkay. That concludes the questions that come in from the webcast platform. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nThank you very much. And, of course, we are ready to continue answering your questions through our Capital Markets Department. Thank you very much for joining us today. Goodbye.",
