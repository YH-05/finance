As usual, Jonathan will take you through the group's financial performance, and I'll provide an update on our businesses and the future opportunities we see for each of them. After the formal presentation, we'll be available to take any questions. \r\nBefore I hand over to Jonathan, I'd like to share the highlights of this year's results with you. I'm delighted to announce operating profit growth of 20% to GBP 201 million, with all 3 divisions contributing to the excellent performance. As a result, adjusted earnings per share have improved by 25% to 104p. Importantly, we're delivering increasing returns, while maintaining a high quality balance sheet and strong capital position. The group's equity tier 1 capital ratio remains strong at 13.1%, while the group's return on equity is now 18%. Due to the strong performance, we've been able to announce 10% increase in the final dividend to 32.5p. Overall, we remain well positioned with growth opportunities in each of our businesses, as I'll discuss later on. \r\nI'll now hand over to Jonathan.\n\n---\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you, Preben. I'll now take you through our performance for the year. We have delivered another strong performance, which is our fifth consecutive year of profit growth. Overall adjusted operating profit increased 20% to GBP 201 million, with growth across all 3 divisions. The good performance in the Banking division has continued, with improved loan book growth of 14%, and a further reduction in bad debt. This led to an increase in profit of some GBP 23 million to GBP 182 million. Securities profits were up 30% at GBP 34 million. Trading conditions improved, particularly for Winterflood, where profits increased nearly 60% to GBP 27 million. And Asset Management increased its profits to GBP 10 million, as division benefited from improved net inflows and operating leverage. Lastly, group net expenses increased by GBP 3 million to GBP 24 million. \r\nTurning now to the income statement in more detail. Overall income for the year increased 13% to GBP 659 million. This reflects the good growth in the Banking division as well as the improvement in Winterflood's performance. The expense/income ratio has remained stable at 63%, as operating expenses grew 14% to GBP 415 million. We've continued to invest in the Banking division, and staff costs have increased in both Banking and Securities, reflecting growth and improved performance. Asset Management costs have remained stable. \r\nDespite growth in the loan book, bad debt charges have continued to improve, and were GBP 44 million for the year. Overall adjusted operating profit is up 20% to GBP 201 million, while adjusted earnings per share increased by 25% to 104p. And finally, we have increased the full year dividend by 10% to 49p, whilst continuing to rebuild our dividend cover. \r\nThe group has a simple and transparent balance sheet, and we've maintained its high quality during the year. Total assets have increased 13% to GBP 7.7 billion, and relate mainly to the lending activities in our Banking division. At year end, our loan book and treasury assets accounted for 85% of the group's total assets. The loan book increased 14% to GBP 5.3 billion, and treasury assets increased to GBP 1.2 billion due to funding raised in the fourth quarter. This is a strong liquidity position that remains well ahead of regulatory requirements. \r\nSecurities assets, which includes short-term settlement balances and trading positions, were slightly higher at over GBP 600 million. This is due to increased trading activity immediately preceding the balance sheet date. These assets are largely offset by trading balances on the liabilities side, and the net position was unchanged at around GBP 100 million. \r\nWe've maintained our strong funding position, with a continued focus on diversity and maturity of our funding sources. In the last year, total funding increased by GBP 850 million to GBP 7.1 billion, covering 135% of the loan book at the balance sheet date. Term funding, with a residual maturity over 1 year, has increased to GBP 3.7 billion. This is a prudent position, covering 70% of the loan book. And the average maturity of this term funding, at 30 months, remains substantially longer than the loan book at just 14 months. We matched our funding with our lending and, therefore, do not currently expect to be materially impacted by rising interest rates. \r\nOur capital position remains strong, and despite the good loan book growth in the year, we've maintained a common equity tier 1 ratio of 13.1%. This ratio remains comfortably ahead of regulatory requirements, and the impact of CRD IV has been broadly neutral overall. Our capital position is supported by our leverage ratio, which stood at 9.2% at the year end. This is a transparent measure which is not affected by risk weightings. Overall, we remain focused on holding a strong level of capital, and we will continue to manage our capital resources carefully. \r\nTurning now to the banking division, which delivered another strong result. Total income increased 13% to GBP 447 million, driven by continued good loan book growth across the lending businesses. Costs were GBP 221 million, this is an increase of 18%, which was principally driven by volume-related growth, in line with the increase in the loan book. In addition, we continue to invest for long-term growth. Overall, the division's profit increased by 15% to GBP 182 million. \r\nOur specialist lending model continued to deliver both good growth and strong returns, and the division's RoE is now 25%. The loan book increased 14% to GBP 5.3 billion, with good growth across all of the businesses. The Retail loan book was up 10% to GBP 2.1 billion, reflecting strong demand in motor finance from existing dealerships. Commercial increased 11% to GBP 2 billion, with good new business volumes in asset finance and new clients in invoice finance. In Property, we have seen strong growth in the year from existing customers. The Property book increased 29% to GBP 1.2 billion, whilst remaining high quality. \r\nWe remain focused on generating strong overall returns to the division through the consistent discipline we apply to our lending. The net interest margin reduced slightly to 8.6% due to a reduction in default fees and a change in mix. The bad debt ratio continued to reduce, reflecting the good credit environment, and is now at 0.9%. As a result, the return on net loan book increased in the year to 3.7%. \r\nIn the Securities division, performance improved, largely due to higher-margin trading and increased volumes at Winterflood. Overall, adjusted operating profit increased 30% to GBP 34 million. Winterflood was the main driver of the performance, with improved trading conditions supporting a GBP 10 million increase in profits to GBP 27 million. Seydler delivered GBP 7 million profit, down slightly as improved trading volumes were offset by a modest decline in capital markets fees. Overall, the division's return on equity improved to 26%. \r\nWinterflood's performance improved in the year due to stronger trading conditions, particularly on AIM. Reflecting this, income per bargain increased to GBP 6.80, this is up slightly on 2013, as increased trading and higher-margin AIM stocks, was offset by stronger volumes in international equities, which are lower margin. Average bargains per day also improved to 56,000, up from 47,000, as trading by retail investors increased. Overall, income was up nearly 30% to GBP 96 million. Winterflood continued to benefit from its variable cost structure. Costs increased 20%, reflecting the increased trading activity. As a result, profits increased by some 60% to GBP 27 million. \r\nNow turning to Asset Management. We're building on last year's momentum, profits have increased to GBP 10 million. Reflecting growth from both our advised and managed propositions, income increased 8% to GBP 84 million. We also achieved good operating leverage as the division builds scale. And in the year, we held costs stable at GBP 75 million. The division's operating margin increased to 12% in the year, whilst its RoE improved to 25%. \r\nAuM increased 7%, principally driven by improved net inflows, and supported by positive market movements. Total inflows were GBP 1.3 billion, up 9% over the last year, as we benefited from a growing distribution network and strong demand from third party IFAs. Outflows in the normal course of business reduced to GBP 0.9 billion, and as a result, overall net flows improved to GBP 400 million or 5% of opening AuM. Together with positive market movements of GBP 200 million, total AuM increased to GBP 9.7 billion. \r\nNow looking at the components of AuM, total managed assets increased 12% to GBP 6.9 billion, reflecting strong IFA sales and good inflows into our high net worth business. Total advised assets increased 2% to GBP 5.2 billion. However, assets which are both advised and managed, increased 9% to GBP 2.4 billion, as we continued to move new and existing clients into our integrated proposition. As a result, the revenue margin improved slightly to 89 basis points. So all in all, this has been another good year for the group. \r\nThank you very much, and I'll hand back to Preben.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Jonathan. As you've just heard, 2014 was a year of continued growth. The strong results we're announcing today are the results of the strategic priorities, discipline and values that define Close Brothers. It's now just over 5 years since the current management team came together to lead the group. We outlined the strategy to position Close Brothers as a group focusing on its expertise and strong relationships, underpinned by a prudent approach to funding and capital. By being there for our customers in all market conditions, we generate good returns through the economic cycle. As the graphs on the right-hand side of this slide demonstrate, the group has made tremendous progress. Since 2010, profits have increased 15%, compounded. Our lending to small businesses and individuals is now over GBP 5 billion. Winterflood continued to trade profitably through the difficult market conditions in 2012 and 2013, while maintaining the largest stock market coverage of any market maker. Our Asset Management business was restructured into a private client wealth manager, and returned to profitability in the time frame that we set out to shareholders. Importantly, all of this investment and growth has taken place while maintaining a consistently strong capital position and increasing dividends. \r\nThe group's success is driven by the strength of our Banking, market-making and wealth management businesses. Each is positioned to be a specialist in its own niche markets, differentiated by our conservative approach and disciplined focus on returns. It's the combination of these businesses as well as the long-term relationships we develop with our clients and the diversity and strength of our financial position that's created such a strong financial services group. \r\nI'd now like to talk you through our values and approach to doing business in more detail. We describe Close Brothers as a modern merchant bank. For us, this is about meeting the financial needs of our clients today, while applying the traditional values of the past. Modern merchant banking aligns our businesses' values of service, experience and relationships. It positions us as a group that encourages innovation and supports enterprise, while staying true to our traditional values of prudence and integrity. We think our values are compelling differentiators. They've ensured that we've remained measured in our approach, because we stick to them irrespective of changes in the economy, market trends or the competitive landscape. For example, in Property, we've had relationships with some of our house builders for almost 30 years. In the midst of the financial crisis in 2009, we remained open for business, continuing to write new loans under the same consistent terms as before. This reliability creates significant customer loyalty, and 65% of our business is written to existing customers. As an example, we began lending to 1 developer in 2009, when their existing lenders reduced their property exposure. To date, we've funded 16 projects with this customer. Our long-term relationships, combined with our strong industry experience, give us the confidence to be able to increase our lending when others do not. \r\nWe need to invest to ensure that we have the capacity to support our high-tough model as well as manage risks and deliver long-term growth to shareholders. We have the resources to undertake large-scale investment programs, but are small enough to implement them effectively. Therefore, by investing in a number of key areas, we can maintain and build our competitive advantage. Our first priority is people. As each of our businesses operates in niche markets, tomorrow's revenue generators need to be trained internally. \r\nWe're making good progress in a number of areas, one of which is the launch of Sales Academy in the bank's Commercial division to recruit and develop front-line staff. \r\nSecondly, regulation. Importantly, we think we're well placed to respond to regulatory reform. Our group structure is simple. We provide straightforward and transparent products tailored to our clients' needs. But regulatory reform is an increasing burden and resource-intensive. We've expanded our risk and compliance functions as well as enhancing our systems and processes. It's an area we continue to invest in, and a risk we will always work hard to mitigate. \r\nFinally, our third investment priority is technology. We've highlighted in the last few presentations that we're investing significant resources in our IT infrastructure and front-end technology. This investment is ongoing. We're upgrading systems in Property and Treasury as well as programs to enhance the customer experience, such as of the new best practice advice process in Asset Management. \r\nNow moving on to Banking in more detail. Our lending model will be very familiar to those of you who know the group well, but I'll provide a quick recap. First and foremost, our model is built on developing long-term customer relationships. We do this through our local network of 45 regional offices, recognizing that every customer has particular needs, with specialist teams who are able to devise flexible solutions and make fast decisions. We often get asked how we maintain our lending model without compromising our returns. I think the following case study is a useful illustration of how our speed and expertise build long-term relationships. We helped an engineering company with the financing to buy a piece of equipment they urgently needed to reduce their dependence on a third-party supplier. Within 4 hours, we've agreed to the financing, and the customer was able to buy the equipment that day. For our customers, our fast and flexible service is incredibly valuable. Our lending model is not easily replicated and we're confident that it remains as relevant now as ever. \r\nIn the last 12 months, we've seen levels of competition start to increase. However, the total supply of credit in our specialist markets still remains below precrisis levels, and is being offset by an improvement in demand. Our motor finance business, in particular, has been impacted by a combination of existing competition returning and new entrants, and both are competing aggressively on price. However, demand is at a 10-year high, and we've grown our motor finance loan book by 14% without compromising our returns. \r\nWhen we last updated you in March, we highlighted that we had not seen a broad-based increase in SME demand. As we currently stand, the overall position remains unchanged. On the plus side, the outlook is more positive. Economic surveys are encouraging. The Federation of Small Businesses has reported in its latest quarterly survey that 25% of SMEs are planning capital investment in the next 12 months. However, in contrast, our own surveys of SME owners found that 35% of businesses are finding trading as tough now as it was 12 months ago. Given the difficult conditions of the last 5 years, it's unsurprising that small businesses remain cautious about investing. \r\nBut Close Brothers is well placed to help SMEs, as soon as their appetite for borrowing increases. Lending to SMEs is at the heart of what we do. We understand their need for finance, for both cash flow management and capital investment. Overall, our view is that our existing markets continue to offer good opportunities, as our share remains relatively small. But importantly, we're not complacent about competition increasing. We continue to invest in enhancing our broad product offering and, where possible, will expand into adjacent sectors or geographies as long as we can maintain our strict underwriting criteria and our strong overall returns. For example, in 2014, we've successfully recruited a renewable energy team within our asset finance business to fund a range of green technologies. \r\nThe graph on the right will be familiar, but it is a powerful demonstration of our track record of growing safely, even when levels of competition fluctuate. We believe we entered the 2015 financial year in a position of strength. \r\nMoving on to Winterflood. Winterflood is a market maker, tailoring its offering through its client-specific requirements by combining the expertise of its staff with the technological advantages of its IT systems. Winterflood offers its clients 2-way prices and holds them open for 15 seconds. It's committed to providing continuous liquidity in all conditions and maintaining its market-leading position. Market conditions in retail investor sentiment have improved following the difficult trading conditions seen in 2012 and 2013. The strengthening economy has helped underpin a resilient equity market. \r\nThe recovery has not been without volatility. Political uncertainty and the rotation out of midcaps in the third quarter of our financial year created periods of uncertainty. However, conditions overall were more favorable. This was reflected in the increase in companies raising capital by our stock market listing over the last 18 months. So far, in 2014, the GBP 13 billion raised from IPOs exceeds the GBP 11 billion raised in the entire 2013 calendar year. This increased primary market activity can be supportive of increased secondary market activity for Winterflood. \r\nWinterflood, being a cyclical business, has responded to these improved conditions with a better performance. This reflects our strategy to concentrate on our core market-making activities and maintain trading capacity. Winterflood has demonstrated the flexibility to adapt its products based on client requirements by offering a wider range of equities to its clients. One example is international trading. Winterflood joined the European exchange Equiduct in 2013, and as its brand has become more established, has benefited from a marked increase in international order flow. \r\nWhile trading conditions have improved in 2014, we're still not at the levels of trading performance seen in 2010. Indeed, trading in August has been quiet. Total market volumes traded on the FTSE -- the FTSE 100 during August this year were the lowest since August of 1999. And Winterflood's performance will obviously be dependent on market conditions going forward. \r\nFinally, on to Asset Management, which performed strongly in 2014. We've built a proposition that provides clients with everything they need throughout their financial life cycle. Our capabilities have centered on building long-term personal relationships between our financial advisers and investment managers and our clients. As they start to build their wealth, clients can use our online investment portal. Once they need more detailed advice, our network of over 100 advisers will help clients build their financial plan with a suite of products, both our own products and those of our -- of other companies, which are designed to best support their needs. Our focus on building long-term relationships allows us to address the evolving financial needs of our clients. \r\nAlongside this, we provide global diversified investment management through a range of investment vehicles. These include our own funds, model portfolios and a fully bespoke service for our high net worth clients. Our platform technology provides clients with a consolidated picture of their wealth. We are in a compelling position to capitalize on significant demographic and market trends, driving increased demand for financial advice and solutions. For instance, we think the far-reaching reforms to the savings and retirement income rules announced earlier this year by the U.K. government are positive and should result in increased demand for high-quality financial advice and flexible investment propositions. We believe that our differentiated product offering, scalable infrastructure as well as our demonstrated financial strength throughout the economic crisis will help us capitalize on these trends. \r\nAs our distribution capability matures, our primary focus is organic growth. We have an experienced adviser force, and we're focused on ensuring that they have the capabilities they need to serve their clients. We will also continue to invest in and develop capabilities and tools designed to maximize productivity and client service. The investments we're making in service, technology and brand awareness will serve us well for the future. \r\nIn addition, we'll capitalize on our longer-term investment performance to help build stronger relationships with third-party IFAs. In the year, our strong investment performance has led to a 25% increase in the number of IFAs we have relationships with. \r\nFinally, we do want to take advantage of opportunities to add further scale and geographic presence through selected infill acquisitions and hiring of advisers and portfolio managers but, as ever, we'll remain disciplined on price and quality. \r\nTo conclude, we're in a strong position and our strategy is well-defined. We will continue to meet the needs of our clients, execute our strategy, and deliver ongoing shareholder value. \r\nIn Banking, we see good opportunities in our core markets. Winterflood is well positioned, but we'll always be sensitive to market conditions. And Asset Management will continue to deliver growth at attractive margins as the business builds scale. We enter 2015 with confidence. \r\nWe now look forward to answering any questions that you may have. As well as Jonathan and I, we're joined by Stephen Hodges from the Bank; Julian Palfreyman from Winterflood; and at the back, Martin Andrew from Asset Management.",

Together with positive market movements of GBP 200 million, total AuM increased to GBP 9.7 billion. \r\nNow looking at the components of AuM, total managed assets increased 12% to GBP 6.9 billion, reflecting strong IFA sales and good inflows into our high net worth business. Total advised assets increased 2% to GBP 5.2 billion. However, assets which are both advised and managed, increased 9% to GBP 2.4 billion, as we continued to move new and existing clients into our integrated proposition. As a result, the revenue margin improved slightly to 89 basis points. So all in all, this has been another good year for the group. \r\nThank you very much, and I'll hand back to Preben.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nThank you, Jonathan. As you've just heard, 2014 was a year of continued growth. The strong results we're announcing today are the results of the strategic priorities, discipline and values that define Close Brothers. It's now just over 5 years since the current management team came together to lead the group. We outlined the strategy to position Close Brothers as a group focusing on its expertise and strong relationships, underpinned by a prudent approach to funding and capital. By being there for our customers in all market conditions, we generate good returns through the economic cycle. As the graphs on the right-hand side of this slide demonstrate, the group has made tremendous progress. Since 2010, profits have increased 15%, compounded. Our lending to small businesses and individuals is now over GBP 5 billion. Winterflood continued to trade profitably through the difficult market conditions in 2012 and 2013, while maintaining the largest stock market coverage of any market maker. Our Asset Management business was restructured into a private client wealth manager, and returned to profitability in the time frame that we set out to shareholders. Importantly, all of this investment and growth has taken place while maintaining a consistently strong capital position and increasing dividends. \r\nThe group's success is driven by the strength of our Banking, market-making and wealth management businesses. Each is positioned to be a specialist in its own niche markets, differentiated by our conservative approach and disciplined focus on returns. It's the combination of these businesses as well as the long-term relationships we develop with our clients and the diversity and strength of our financial position that's created such a strong financial services group. \r\nI'd now like to talk you through our values and approach to doing business in more detail. We describe Close Brothers as a modern merchant bank. For us, this is about meeting the financial needs of our clients today, while applying the traditional values of the past. Modern merchant banking aligns our businesses' values of service, experience and relationships. It positions us as a group that encourages innovation and supports enterprise, while staying true to our traditional values of prudence and integrity. We think our values are compelling differentiators. They've ensured that we've remained measured in our approach, because we stick to them irrespective of changes in the economy, market trends or the competitive landscape. For example, in Property, we've had relationships with some of our house builders for almost 30 years. In the midst of the financial crisis in 2009, we remained open for business, continuing to write new loans under the same consistent terms as before. This reliability creates significant customer loyalty, and 65% of our business is written to existing customers. As an example, we began lending to 1 developer in 2009, when their existing lenders reduced their property exposure. To date, we've funded 16 projects with this customer. Our long-term relationships, combined with our strong industry experience, give us the confidence to be able to increase our lending when others do not. \r\nWe need to invest to ensure that we have the capacity to support our high-tough model as well as manage risks and deliver long-term growth to shareholders. We have the resources to undertake large-scale investment programs, but are small enough to implement them effectively. Therefore, by investing in a number of key areas, we can maintain and build our competitive advantage. Our first priority is people. As each of our businesses operates in niche markets, tomorrow's revenue generators need to be trained internally. \r\nWe're making good progress in a number of areas, one of which is the launch of Sales Academy in the bank's Commercial division to recruit and develop front-line staff. \r\nSecondly, regulation. Importantly, we think we're well placed to respond to regulatory reform. Our group structure is simple. We provide straightforward and transparent products tailored to our clients' needs. But regulatory reform is an increasing burden and resource-intensive. We've expanded our risk and compliance functions as well as enhancing our systems and processes. It's an area we continue to invest in, and a risk we will always work hard to mitigate. \r\nFinally, our third investment priority is technology. We've highlighted in the last few presentations that we're investing significant resources in our IT infrastructure and front-end technology. This investment is ongoing. We're upgrading systems in Property and Treasury as well as programs to enhance the customer experience, such as of the new best practice advice process in Asset Management. \r\nNow moving on to Banking in more detail. Our lending model will be very familiar to those of you who know the group well, but I'll provide a quick recap. First and foremost, our model is built on developing long-term customer relationships. We do this through our local network of 45 regional offices, recognizing that every customer has particular needs, with specialist teams who are able to devise flexible solutions and make fast decisions. We often get asked how we maintain our lending model without compromising our returns. I think the following case study is a useful illustration of how our speed and expertise build long-term relationships. We helped an engineering company with the financing to buy a piece of equipment they urgently needed to reduce their dependence on a third-party supplier. Within 4 hours, we've agreed to the financing, and the customer was able to buy the equipment that day. For our customers, our fast and flexible service is incredibly valuable. Our lending model is not easily replicated and we're confident that it remains as relevant now as ever. \r\nIn the last 12 months, we've seen levels of competition start to increase. However, the total supply of credit in our specialist markets still remains below precrisis levels, and is being offset by an improvement in demand. Our motor finance business, in particular, has been impacted by a combination of existing competition returning and new entrants, and both are competing aggressively on price. However, demand is at a 10-year high, and we've grown our motor finance loan book by 14% without compromising our returns. \r\nWhen we last updated you in March, we highlighted that we had not seen a broad-based increase in SME demand. As we currently stand, the overall position remains unchanged. On the plus side, the outlook is more positive. Economic surveys are encouraging. The Federation of Small Businesses has reported in its latest quarterly survey that 25% of SMEs are planning capital investment in the next 12 months. However, in contrast, our own surveys of SME owners found that 35% of businesses are finding trading as tough now as it was 12 months ago. Given the difficult conditions of the last 5 years, it's unsurprising that small businesses remain cautious about investing. \r\nBut Close Brothers is well placed to help SMEs, as soon as their appetite for borrowing increases. Lending to SMEs is at the heart of what we do. We understand their need for finance, for both cash flow management and capital investment. Overall, our view is that our existing markets continue to offer good opportunities, as our share remains relatively small. But importantly, we're not complacent about competition increasing. We continue to invest in enhancing our broad product offering and, where possible, will expand into adjacent sectors or geographies as long as we can maintain our strict underwriting criteria and our strong overall returns. For example, in 2014, we've successfully recruited a renewable energy team within our asset finance business to fund a range of green technologies. \r\nThe graph on the right will be familiar, but it is a powerful demonstration of our track record of growing safely, even when levels of competition fluctuate. We believe we entered the 2015 financial year in a position of strength. \r\nMoving on to Winterflood. Winterflood is a market maker, tailoring its offering through its client-specific requirements by combining the expertise of its staff with the technological advantages of its IT systems. Winterflood offers its clients 2-way prices and holds them open for 15 seconds. It's committed to providing continuous liquidity in all conditions and maintaining its market-leading position. Market conditions in retail investor sentiment have improved following the difficult trading conditions seen in 2012 and 2013. The strengthening economy has helped underpin a resilient equity market. \r\nThe recovery has not been without volatility. Political uncertainty and the rotation out of midcaps in the third quarter of our financial year created periods of uncertainty. However, conditions overall were more favorable. This was reflected in the increase in companies raising capital by our stock market listing over the last 18 months. So far, in 2014, the GBP 13 billion raised from IPOs exceeds the GBP 11 billion raised in the entire 2013 calendar year. This increased primary market activity can be supportive of increased secondary market activity for Winterflood. \r\nWinterflood, being a cyclical business, has responded to these improved conditions with a better performance. This reflects our strategy to concentrate on our core market-making activities and maintain trading capacity. Winterflood has demonstrated the flexibility to adapt its products based on client requirements by offering a wider range of equities to its clients. One example is international trading. Winterflood joined the European exchange Equiduct in 2013, and as its brand has become more established, has benefited from a marked increase in international order flow. \r\nWhile trading conditions have improved in 2014, we're still not at the levels of trading performance seen in 2010. Indeed, trading in August has been quiet. Total market volumes traded on the FTSE -- the FTSE 100 during August this year were the lowest since August of 1999. And Winterflood's performance will obviously be dependent on market conditions going forward. \r\nFinally, on to Asset Management, which performed strongly in 2014. We've built a proposition that provides clients with everything they need throughout their financial life cycle. Our capabilities have centered on building long-term personal relationships between our financial advisers and investment managers and our clients. As they start to build their wealth, clients can use our online investment portal. Once they need more detailed advice, our network of over 100 advisers will help clients build their financial plan with a suite of products, both our own products and those of our -- of other companies, which are designed to best support their needs. Our focus on building long-term relationships allows us to address the evolving financial needs of our clients. \r\nAlongside this, we provide global diversified investment management through a range of investment vehicles. These include our own funds, model portfolios and a fully bespoke service for our high net worth clients. Our platform technology provides clients with a consolidated picture of their wealth. We are in a compelling position to capitalize on significant demographic and market trends, driving increased demand for financial advice and solutions. For instance, we think the far-reaching reforms to the savings and retirement income rules announced earlier this year by the U.K. government are positive and should result in increased demand for high-quality financial advice and flexible investment propositions. We believe that our differentiated product offering, scalable infrastructure as well as our demonstrated financial strength throughout the economic crisis will help us capitalize on these trends. \r\nAs our distribution capability matures, our primary focus is organic growth. We have an experienced adviser force, and we're focused on ensuring that they have the capabilities they need to serve their clients. We will also continue to invest in and develop capabilities and tools designed to maximize productivity and client service. The investments we're making in service, technology and brand awareness will serve us well for the future. \r\nIn addition, we'll capitalize on our longer-term investment performance to help build stronger relationships with third-party IFAs. In the year, our strong investment performance has led to a 25% increase in the number of IFAs we have relationships with. \r\nFinally, we do want to take advantage of opportunities to add further scale and geographic presence through selected infill acquisitions and hiring of advisers and portfolio managers but, as ever, we'll remain disciplined on price and quality. \r\nTo conclude, we're in a strong position and our strategy is well-defined. We will continue to meet the needs of our clients, execute our strategy, and deliver ongoing shareholder value. \r\nIn Banking, we see good opportunities in our core markets. Winterflood is well positioned, but we'll always be sensitive to market conditions. And Asset Management will continue to deliver growth at attractive margins as the business builds scale. We enter 2015 with confidence. \r\nWe now look forward to answering any questions that you may have. As well as Jonathan and I, we're joined by Stephen Hodges from the Bank; Julian Palfreyman from Winterflood; and at the back, Martin Andrew from Asset Management.",
      "transcript_text3": "As usual, could you please state your name and company before asking a question.\n\n---\n\nIt's Justin Bates from Liberum. Just on the Banking business. Could you touch on the step change that there's been in Treasury and other non-lending income? Would you consider that to be a one-off step change or is there a little bit more to go this year? And rounding off on that division, is it fair to assume that the return on the net loan book has peaked?\n\n---\n\nJust on the Treasury side, it's worth repeating that Treasury at Close Brothers is a cost center, not a profit center. And so it's in the business of raising funding that we need for the loan book and for our high-quality liquidity. That's its purpose. But there are, however, timing differences with that, that caused this to happen. And Jonathan, you might want to just expand on that because it's important to understand.\n\n---\n\nYes. It's really a sort of a short-term anomaly, so don't read too much into it. In that, as we've seen our funding costs reduced slightly during the second half of the year, we will only periodically pass those improvements in funding costs through to the lending divisions. And so on a temporary basis, that has meant that a little bit more profit and income has been retained in Treasury than we would normally do so. But going forward, we're going to make sure that any reduction or increase in funding costs, at the moment, we're seeing reductions, are passed through sort of promptly to the lending divisions. And then the next question is, has that had a slight impact on the net interest margin that we're reporting? Yes, it has, but it's marginal and it's in the region of about 0.1. So a marginal impact. But going forward, you will not see that impact.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And the net return on the loan book, I think it has been slightly higher than where it is today, but would it be fair to assume it's peaked?\n\n---\n\nNot necessarily. It's an output of a number of factors, as you know. At the moment, we have got a bad debt ratio down at 0.9%, that is, I think, effectively, a 30-year low for us. Every time we get to this point of the cycle, this is the lowest that it gets, and so it is unlikely for us to see it materially improve or, indeed, we don't anticipate in the forthcoming months to see that increasing at this stage. So that is very much at the bottom of the range. But the other driver that you've -- are sort of aware of, and we just touched on, is the net interest margin. That's at 8.6%, has slipped down slightly on the previous year. We don't see a material change in the forthcoming months in the net interest margin. But over the medium-term, we've got lots of scope in that margin. And as you know, only a few years ago, we were up at about 10%. The general range that we've seen operating historically has been in this 8%, 8.5% range, up to 10%. So to answer your question directly, no, it's certainly not the peak. But given where bad debts are, and given the net interest margin and the environment that we're in, it's unlikely that it's going to sort of materially improve from here.\n\n---\n\nIt's Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital. I just wanted to pick a little bit further on the bad debt charge, and obviously, you've mentioned it's at a historical low. How much of that's being driven by change in business mix? And therefore, what would a through-to-cycle average bad debt charge look like with the current business mix? So that's the first question. And then the second question is on the Asset Management business. Thinking back to when you originally presented the targets around improving profitability margins and performance for that business, you talked about a revenue margin of around about 100 basis points. And I think you're delivering the profitability and the operating margin that you guided towards, partly because cost control is very good, but the revenue margin doesn't seem to be progressing quite as much as maybe I originally anticipated, despite the fact you've got the improving mix of business. So maybe if you could just talk about how that business has evolved relative to your original expectations, and whether I'm just misreading things or it is different.\n\n---\n\nSure. Just on your first question about bad debt, and whether that's a function of a change in business mix, I think there has been no really big change in business mix. So we have had about 40% of our business in the Commercial division, about 40% in the Retail division and about 20% in Property for, certainly, the last 5 years that I've been here. And notwithstanding the growth that's occurred, that mix has changed -- has stayed, roughly, at about that level. I think this particular year, Property has moved up to 22%, for example, but there's no really big change there. So I don't think that's a mix issue. I think we're benefiting, as lots of people are, from the current environment. And that's true both in terms of the capacity to pay as well as asset prices. And that's  really why we're at a cyclical low.\n\n---\n\nCan I just add to that? I think just that the margins as well, during the period of contraction by our international competitors and by the large banks, in parts of the bank and parts of the lending businesses, we've taken the opportunity to move up the scale slightly in credit quality with some of our customers. So not necessarily seeing the impact of that now but, potentially, that can assist us when the cycle turns.\n\n---\n\nSo on that, sort of 10-year average you presented of 1.5%,  I guess normalized now, you might think you'd be a little bit below that, but maybe 1.3%, something like that?\n\n---\n\nI think it depends on how long a cycle you look at. So is a 10-year cycle the right cycle? As we're moving through this particular period, some of the 10-year numbers are actually moving a little bit. It's interesting that we looked at 10-year loan growth, for example. We've always talked about 10-year loan growth of 11% a year. Well, actually, now, 10-year loan growth is 12%, and these things just change as the cycle extends. But there's nothing really truly profound going on in what we're doing. Your second question was in relation to the revenue margin in Asset Management, and you're correct that, at this level, we had originally set out 100 basis points for 2015. We think we will be below that, whereas, on the pretax operating margin side, we had set out 15% for 2015. We're at 12% for this year, and we're on track to meet that. So I think the overall answer to that is that our channels that we're distributing through and that we're going through are -- vary in terms of how mature they are or how young they are. And some of them are moving faster than others, and that relates to, for example, the IFA channel to the high net worth channel, the discretionary channel, as opposed to the advised channel. So the advised channel was the one that was most involved in the integration of acquisitions, most involved in systems replacements, most involved in the kind of writing of the proposition, bringing all of that together. High net worth was less involved in that, and is an older channel for us. The IFA channel is, obviously, more straightforward in terms of being a function of our investment products and services. Advised and managed is our sweet spot in terms of the highest margin business, that's well over 100 basis points. That grew nicely this year, but the managed bit is reflecting the growth in the IFA channel, it's reflecting the growth in the discretionary fund management business, and that, I think, it's 72 basis points. So it's the speed at which these channels are growing which is affecting the mix, which is affecting the revenue margin. I think our long-term outlook for the revenue margin continues to be very favorable. We have not seen resistance to our pricing in our advised proposition, in our managed proposition. It's more the rate at which they gain traction.\n\n---\n\nArnaud Giblat from UBS. A couple of questions. First, on the -- to continue on the Asset Management business, the costs essentially have been flatter over the -- year-on-year. I'm wondering how the cost dynamics play out versus revenues. Should we expect such operating leverage going forward? Equally, in your assumption, I think your guidance was for 15% operating margin in 2015. Does that mean you're only assuming small levels of inflows? What are the components that get you to 15%? And secondly, in Banking, could you, perhaps, expand a bit on the dynamics of competition in motor finance? Are you seeing competitors act at a given dealer level or?\n\n---\n\nSure. Okay, let me start on the Asset Management one, and may I ask Martin to pitch in here. I think, first of all, our target for next year remains 15% for our pretax operating margin, that's the one that we set out a couple of years ago, and that's the target we have for that. And I think you're right that we have held costs very flat for the last year or 2, and that's clearly contributed to the operating leverage, which has contributed to the rise in that margin. I think as we continue to evolve the business, we need to invest so we may not get quite as much of a benefit from having absolutely flat costs. I think that would be one issue. But on the inflow side, this year, we had 7% net inflows, 2% from the market, 5% net of market, and we think that's respectable. But as I mentioned, it's a function of the difference in maturity of the different channels, and we would certainly not see that reversing. We would like to see some progress in that, but that's respectable, if you like. So Martin, do you want to add anything to that?\n\n---\n\nNot really, Preben. As we've already mentioned, the greatest operational gearing part of our business is in the investment management element and the platform element. And you can see in our results that the investment management area is I think -- it's actually been growing fastest and, therefore, we've been able to hold costs flat. As and when our advised side of our business starts growing and we increase the growth rate there, and the growth rate of clients, it's inevitable we'll have to increase headcount as well. That -- the cost component there is more variable; in the operational gearing, less.\n\n---\n\nAnd then, the -- just to your second question on competition in motor finance, we refer to it in the text. We have seen more competition in motor finance. We've seen that both, actually, from the 2 largest participants who are Lloyds, Black Horse and Santander. Also, from Barclays. So at the very large end, we've seen increased competition. And we've also seen new entrants into that market. I think it's important to repeat the difference between our model and the big banks that are in that business. They are highly centralized in their approach. We are based on having a network of branches. We are more relationship-focused, we are more flexible, and our offering, therefore, is different. I think it's also important to note that notwithstanding the increase in competition, we grew the book by 14% because, obviously, we were benefiting from new car registrations but also the spillover effect into demand for secondhand costs. So the consumer has clearly been buying. The final point I would make is that we are not focused on maintaining or holding a certain level of market share. We're focused on our model, we're focused on our returns. And so our market share went up sharply at the beginning of the credit crisis, when others withdrew, to a peak of I think, Stephen, around 11 or so for motor, and we've seen that come down -- there are different ways of measuring it, but call it 9, now as we had conceded share rather than protecting share and maintaining our returns.\n\n---\n\nIt's Robin Savage from Canaccord. Coming back to the Asset Management margin, if you look at the business first half and second half, I think we can see that the margin in the second half was 15%. And I just wonder, looking forward to the first half in the coming year, are you indicating that the first half may well have some investments that may mean that the margin improvement doesn't continue first half on the previous second half?\n\n---\n\nThe business has momentum, we would like to see the business continue that momentum. But as Martin said, there are different kind of cost elements to the growth in the different parts of the business. We get a lot more leverage out of increasing the managed, discretionary fund management side of the business or, indeed, the IFA side of business. And so it's really just that there are different speeds involved here. And rather than trying to kind of micromanage this, we think the message we want to give you is that we're happy with the 15% overall pretax operating margin for 2015. And I think that's probably the best position for us to take.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And so my final question is on the dividend. I just wonder whether you can talk about the dividend, where you've got the Securities business, effectively 100% of the earnings are distributable; the Asset Management, you may have selective acquisitions, but so broadly, it's a distributable earnings stream; and the Banking division, producing a 25% return on equity, and your growth over the last 10 years being 12%.\n\n---\n\nSo you want a bigger dividend? This is around the issue of the progression in the dividend, and the build of the cover as well as the growth in the dividend itself. That's really what we're seeking to manage, and we've talked about that extensively over the past couple of years. But Jonathan, do you want to just take this?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, just as Preben has said, we set out, I think 3 to 4 years ago now, we had a dual objective. One was to increase the dividend in a sustainable and progressive way, and also running parallel with that -- very importantly, running parallel with that, also to improve the dividend cover. And if you look back over the last 4 years, that's exactly what we've done. The cover back in FY '10 was 1.5%, and we have progressively moved that back to 2.1%. And during that period, we've put in 4 successive years of dividend increase: 3%, 4%, 7%, and then, 10% this year. And so given the circumstances and the way the businesses have been delivering, and the RoE that we can achieve, looking on a group basis, we are very keen and certain that we want to maintain the improvement in the dividend cover to an appropriate level. And we look at sort of well-run, well-established banks, and they're at about 2.5%, whilst at the same time, pushing in dividend increases that we think are sustainable and appropriate. And that's what we think we've done over the last 4 years.\n\n---\n\nAny other questions? Thank you very much, indeed. Thank you.",

I think this particular year, Property has moved up to 22%, for example, but there's no really big change there. So I don't think that's a mix issue. I think we're benefiting, as lots of people are, from the current environment. And that's true both in terms of the capacity to pay as well as asset prices. And that's  really why we're at a cyclical low.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jonathan Howell (Executives)】\nCan I just add to that? I think just that the margins as well, during the period of contraction by our international competitors and by the large banks, in parts of the bank and parts of the lending businesses, we've taken the opportunity to move up the scale slightly in credit quality with some of our customers. So not necessarily seeing the impact of that now but, potentially, that can assist us when the cycle turns.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gary Greenwood (Analysts)】\nSo on that, sort of 10-year average you presented of 1.5%,  I guess normalized now, you might think you'd be a little bit below that, but maybe 1.3%, something like that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nI think it depends on how long a cycle you look at. So is a 10-year cycle the right cycle? As we're moving through this particular period, some of the 10-year numbers are actually moving a little bit. It's interesting that we looked at 10-year loan growth, for example. We've always talked about 10-year loan growth of 11% a year. Well, actually, now, 10-year loan growth is 12%, and these things just change as the cycle extends. But there's nothing really truly profound going on in what we're doing. Your second question was in relation to the revenue margin in Asset Management, and you're correct that, at this level, we had originally set out 100 basis points for 2015. We think we will be below that, whereas, on the pretax operating margin side, we had set out 15% for 2015. We're at 12% for this year, and we're on track to meet that. So I think the overall answer to that is that our channels that we're distributing through and that we're going through are -- vary in terms of how mature they are or how young they are. And some of them are moving faster than others, and that relates to, for example, the IFA channel to the high net worth channel, the discretionary channel, as opposed to the advised channel. So the advised channel was the one that was most involved in the integration of acquisitions, most involved in systems replacements, most involved in the kind of writing of the proposition, bringing all of that together. High net worth was less involved in that, and is an older channel for us. The IFA channel is, obviously, more straightforward in terms of being a function of our investment products and services. Advised and managed is our sweet spot in terms of the highest margin business, that's well over 100 basis points. That grew nicely this year, but the managed bit is reflecting the growth in the IFA channel, it's reflecting the growth in the discretionary fund management business, and that, I think, it's 72 basis points. So it's the speed at which these channels are growing which is affecting the mix, which is affecting the revenue margin. I think our long-term outlook for the revenue margin continues to be very favorable. We have not seen resistance to our pricing in our advised proposition, in our managed proposition. It's more the rate at which they gain traction.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Arnaud Giblat (Analysts)】\nArnaud Giblat from UBS. A couple of questions. First, on the -- to continue on the Asset Management business, the costs essentially have been flatter over the -- year-on-year. I'm wondering how the cost dynamics play out versus revenues. Should we expect such operating leverage going forward? Equally, in your assumption, I think your guidance was for 15% operating margin in 2015. Does that mean you're only assuming small levels of inflows? What are the components that get you to 15%? And secondly, in Banking, could you, perhaps, expand a bit on the dynamics of competition in motor finance? Are you seeing competitors act at a given dealer level or?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nSure. Okay, let me start on the Asset Management one, and may I ask Martin to pitch in here. I think, first of all, our target for next year remains 15% for our pretax operating margin, that's the one that we set out a couple of years ago, and that's the target we have for that. And I think you're right that we have held costs very flat for the last year or 2, and that's clearly contributed to the operating leverage, which has contributed to the rise in that margin. I think as we continue to evolve the business, we need to invest so we may not get quite as much of a benefit from having absolutely flat costs. I think that would be one issue. But on the inflow side, this year, we had 7% net inflows, 2% from the market, 5% net of market, and we think that's respectable. But as I mentioned, it's a function of the difference in maturity of the different channels, and we would certainly not see that reversing. We would like to see some progress in that, but that's respectable, if you like. So Martin, do you want to add anything to that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Andrew (Executives)】\nNot really, Preben. As we've already mentioned, the greatest operational gearing part of our business is in the investment management element and the platform element. And you can see in our results that the investment management area is I think -- it's actually been growing fastest and, therefore, we've been able to hold costs flat. As and when our advised side of our business starts growing and we increase the growth rate there, and the growth rate of clients, it's inevitable we'll have to increase headcount as well. That -- the cost component there is more variable; in the operational gearing, less.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nAnd then, the -- just to your second question on competition in motor finance, we refer to it in the text. We have seen more competition in motor finance. We've seen that both, actually, from the 2 largest participants who are Lloyds, Black Horse and Santander. Also, from Barclays. So at the very large end, we've seen increased competition. And we've also seen new entrants into that market. I think it's important to repeat the difference between our model and the big banks that are in that business. They are highly centralized in their approach. We are based on having a network of branches. We are more relationship-focused, we are more flexible, and our offering, therefore, is different. I think it's also important to note that notwithstanding the increase in competition, we grew the book by 14% because, obviously, we were benefiting from new car registrations but also the spillover effect into demand for secondhand costs. So the consumer has clearly been buying. The final point I would make is that we are not focused on maintaining or holding a certain level of market share. We're focused on our model, we're focused on our returns. And so our market share went up sharply at the beginning of the credit crisis, when others withdrew, to a peak of I think, Stephen, around 11 or so for motor, and we've seen that come down -- there are different ways of measuring it, but call it 9, now as we had conceded share rather than protecting share and maintaining our returns.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robin Savage (Analysts)】\nIt's Robin Savage from Canaccord. Coming back to the Asset Management margin, if you look at the business first half and second half, I think we can see that the margin in the second half was 15%. And I just wonder, looking forward to the first half in the coming year, are you indicating that the first half may well have some investments that may mean that the margin improvement doesn't continue first half on the previous second half?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nThe business has momentum, we would like to see the business continue that momentum. But as Martin said, there are different kind of cost elements to the growth in the different parts of the business. We get a lot more leverage out of increasing the managed, discretionary fund management side of the business or, indeed, the IFA side of business. And so it's really just that there are different speeds involved here. And rather than trying to kind of micromanage this, we think the message we want to give you is that we're happy with the 15% overall pretax operating margin for 2015. And I think that's probably the best position for us to take.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robin Savage (Analysts)】\nOkay. And so my final question is on the dividend. I just wonder whether you can talk about the dividend, where you've got the Securities business, effectively 100% of the earnings are distributable; the Asset Management, you may have selective acquisitions, but so broadly, it's a distributable earnings stream; and the Banking division, producing a 25% return on equity, and your growth over the last 10 years being 12%.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nSo you want a bigger dividend? This is around the issue of the progression in the dividend, and the build of the cover as well as the growth in the dividend itself. That's really what we're seeking to manage, and we've talked about that extensively over the past couple of years. But Jonathan, do you want to just take this?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jonathan Howell (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, just as Preben has said, we set out, I think 3 to 4 years ago now, we had a dual objective. One was to increase the dividend in a sustainable and progressive way, and also running parallel with that -- very importantly, running parallel with that, also to improve the dividend cover. And if you look back over the last 4 years, that's exactly what we've done. The cover back in FY '10 was 1.5%, and we have progressively moved that back to 2.1%. And during that period, we've put in 4 successive years of dividend increase: 3%, 4%, 7%, and then, 10% this year. And so given the circumstances and the way the businesses have been delivering, and the RoE that we can achieve, looking on a group basis, we are very keen and certain that we want to maintain the improvement in the dividend cover to an appropriate level. And we look at sort of well-run, well-established banks, and they're at about 2.5%, whilst at the same time, pushing in dividend increases that we think are sustainable and appropriate. And that's what we think we've done over the last 4 years.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nAny other questions? Thank you very much, indeed. Thank you.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for listening in on this webcast regarding Couche-Tard first quarter of fiscal 2015. As usual, we will briefly run through the results and after some background information before answering questions you submitted earlier today. We are very delighted to present the results of the first quarter of fiscal 2015, which represents strong organic growth on every front. This quarter's performance demonstrates the effective work done by our teams and their efforts to continuously improve the profitability of our network.\r\nAdjusted for nonrecurring items, our net earnings increased by 25.5%, which is a very nice performance. The results of our European network continued to be positive. Same-store sales and volumes have grown and margins have increased. Many strategies implemented in previous years are now part of daily business, contributing to this steady growth. We are still on track to materialize the expected synergies as per our plan.\r\nIn North America, we continued to show good results with improved margins in the U.S. for merchandise and services. Our road transportation fuel margins remained strong in all of our markets, which contributed to the solid earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. As demonstrated in previous years, although road transportation fuel margins can be volatile from one quarter to another, it tend to normalize on an annual basis. Improved supply condition also helped maintain strong margins.\r\nAs in previous quarter, our still-improving leverage ratios and solid balance sheet put us in a good position to materialize potential opportunities. As for network expansion, during and subsequent of the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we acquired or reached an agreement to acquire 73 company-operated stores in the United States. We have also built or rebuilt 11 stores since the beginning of the fiscal year. For this fiscal year 2015, we will accelerate materially the pace of new constructions planning to build or rebuild a total of between 80 and 100 stores. In term of acquisitions, as always, we cannot say much, considering the confidential nature of the subject, but we are actively looking at opportunities of different sizes. Believe me, we were busy during the summer. However, our discipline has served us well in the past, and we will stick to that. We don't feel that we need to overpay to continue creating significant value for our stakeholders. Our continuous work to improve the quality and performance of our network, the performance of food in our stores, our nice pipeline of new sites and the realization of synergies during the current fiscal year will continue to add value.\r\nAs you saw this morning, as part of the perpetual process of reviewing our assets, we sold our aviation business. We think that this deal would be good for all the parties involved, including the employees.\r\nNow I will let Raymond go over our numbers in more detail. Raymond?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Alain. Good afternoon, everyone. This is a great first quarter to start fiscal year 2015. We have very positive indicator and strong organic growth. We have posted net earnings of $269.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Some items affected the results of this quarter, and they are described in our MD&A. Once adjusted for these items, adjusted net earnings stood at $276 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2015, a great increase of 25.5%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share stood at approximately $0.48 compared to $0.39 for the corresponding prior quarters, an increase of 23.1%. The strong growth in net earnings derived mainly from our organic growth in both merchandise and services and in road transportation fuel. Same-store sales and volume, as well as consolidated gross margin, all showed positive results. This nice growth was also supported by the contribution from our recent acquisition. These items, which contributed to the growth in net earnings, were partially offset by the negative net impact of the conversion of our sales and expenses from our Canadian and European operations into U.S. dollars. These results are solid and proved that our business model doesn't rely solely on acquisitions.\r\nInstead of repeating the MD&A, I will quickly highlight some of the key indicators. For the first quarters, our same-store merchandise sales increased by 2.8% in the United States; by 1.2% in Europe; and by 3.3% in Canada. Specifically in the United States, this growth is particularly impressive considering we were once again able to grow store traffic at the same time that we increased our gross margins.\r\nThe consolidated merchandise and services gross margin grew by $26.9 million when excluding the negative impact from the currency translation. In the United States, the gross margin increased by 0.6% to 39.8%. In Europe, the gross margin increased by 1.3% to 41.9%. While in Canada, it decreased by 0.7% to 33.3%. The merchandise and services gross margin for the first quarter on a consolidated grew by 0.3% to 34.1%. The decrease in Canada for -- from increased cigarette sales and pricing strategies aimed at boosting store traffic.\r\nFor the fuel during the first quarter, same-store volumes increased by 1.8% in the United States, by 1.7% in Europe and by 0.3% in Canada. Our fuel brand miles in Europe is, as we have previously described, a good contributor to our results and continues to help us grow in the market where it has been launched. This performance is solid compared to any public benchmarks. This results from our focus on execution and from the quality of our people and our network.\r\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we posted road transportation fuel gross margins in the U.S. of $0.238 per gallon, or of $0.1167 per liter in Europe, and CAD 0.0644 per liter in Canada. These great margins are the results of favorable market conditions, together with improved supply terms. As usual, we continued our good work in controlling expenses. Although our organic growth is significant, the increase in our operational expense is less than inflation. We are really proud of that achievement. The materialization of synergies should accelerate in Europe, now that we completed the implementation of our new ERP solution and summer is behind us.\r\nThe first quarter of fiscal 2015 shows an income tax rate of 20.7% compared to an income tax rate of 18.9% for the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The increase in the income tax rate seems mainly from the effect of our higher overall taxable income, especially in the United States where we have our highest statutory tax rate, as well as from the decrease in our financial fees, following the significant repayment we had made on our long-term debt. The bottom line is this is a good news.\r\nSince the beginning of the fiscal year and up to today, we are -- we have -- we paid $440 million of our long-term debt using cash generated from our operation. With a portion of those repayments, we completely -- we completed the reimbursement of the $3.2 billion that was used for the acquisition of Statoil Fuel & Retail in June 2012.\r\nAs at July 20, 2014, our adjusted net interest-bearing debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio of 2.23x is still showing rapid improvement. This gives us great flexibility in taking advantage of investment opportunities. Our return on capital employed also improved, reaching 14% for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. The disposal of our aviation business should have also a positive impact on this indicator going forward.\r\nFinally, we have, again, increased our quarterly dividend to $0.045, which then correspond to our 12.5% increase. Yet, we are happy to share the results of the growth of our solid and diversified free cash flow with our shareholders, as we have done gradually over the years. This may not be much, but we believe we will continue to generate solid [indiscernible] considering the opportunity in front of us in the future years.\r\nWe are also very happy that Moody's has recognized the quality of our credit profile by improving their credit rating of our Canadian dollars-denominated unsecured notes to Baa2. We believe that this improvement results from the quality and the sustainability of our free cash flow, our solid balance sheet and our commitment to managing it properly even with acquisition opportunities. We have also demonstrated, since the acquisition of Statoil Fuel & Retail and as we have in the past, our focus and capacity to reduce our leverage quickly, which was done earlier than expected.\r\nAnd that conclude my part. Alain?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Raymond. I would like to take the opportunity to remind you that this was my last webcast as President and CEO of Couche-Tard. I want to thank you all. And I will now let Brian conclude this presentation before we move forward with the questions. So with that, Brian and Raymond will answers -- answer all the questions.\n\n---\n\nAll right. Thank you, Alain, and good afternoon, everyone. Like Alain and Raymond, I'm very happy with the results of the first quarter of fiscal 2015. It's a strong start for what I believe will be a very good year. The strong results showed the knowledge and skills of the teams who are continuously improving our offers to our customers. The success of our strategy is clearly reflected in this quarter's organic growth, both in North America and Europe. We're dedicated to continuing on this path, and we expect to continue delivering value for our shareholders and our stakeholders.\r\nSo again, with that introduction, we'll now go to questions.",

      "transcript_text3": "First, what I can say is that the -- we'll continue to deleverage, and we gain basically more and more flexibility on our balance sheet. At the same time, as we did mention in our presentation, we'll continue to look at opportunities to use properly our cash flow generated. As you know, last year, we did generate over $860 million of free cash flow, and it's very solid. Hopefully, we will improve it this year. And we'll use this money basically properly in order to generate value for the shareholders.\n\n---\n\nWe're very pleased with the results of the new industry sites we've developed over the last 2 years. So very excited about the opportunity to accelerate that initiative. At the same time, we don't expect any material change in net CapEx. We certainly will be spending less in IT than we have in Europe in the last 2 years and reallocating that more towards growth. We also were sitting on probably our best portfolio of land banks that we've had in our history as we committed to repay the debt, as Raymond talked about on the last question. In terms of where, Europe will be the smallest participant in this as we haven't had time to ramp up our land banks and opportunities there. So today the largest focus would be in the southern and western U.S., with the Midwest U.S. and Canada being second.\n\n---\n\nHopefully, as I mentioned, basically our balance sheet -- I will say, our balance sheet is already pretty solid and will continue to improve. And could allow us to materialize sizable acquisition without going close to deleverage following the SFR acquisition. In term of acquisition environment, I will say the environment is pretty solid as we described basically in the -- previously on our comments. On both side of the ocean, and we continue to, I will say, to -- with the same discipline that we always have to basically to look at these opportunities and to work on these opportunities. As you saw recently, we can close transaction at reasonable multiples even in the U.S. And I will say our goal is still the same, and we're pretty busy and active. I will say it's pretty much what I can see basically in terms of physic.\n\n---\n\nYes. The change, again, in Europe has been large really on all fronts. Specifically, on merchandise really affect -- attacking all aspects of the in-store operation. Food being our main focus, great results. We're seeing double-digit growth as the teams introduced new products, enhanced menu boards for better communication, new coffee program rolling out in Europe. And then, probably the biggest effort we've had is the merchandising -- we call it the merchandising step-up where we had our teams from Europe come and learn about kind of basic convenience/category management skills and came away with plans to really change plan-a-gram [ph] SKUs, adjacencies, point-of-purchase material and promotional schemes. And so over the last 6 months, we're wrapping up with the rollout of that, with Norway being the last country. So we're seeing traction with the consumer as we finish those tactics and are optimistic that, that will continue.\n\n---\n\nI will say in -- I can say that our approach in any part of the world is flexible, and we could adjust basically to different opportunities. We did that even in North America basically with 2 joint ventures done there. Based on the reality of each countries where we could be interested to see our brands or basically use our expertise, we will kind of adjust based on the kind of opportunity that will be in front of us. Our disciplined approach will be also a factor that we'll maintain basically in any markets and with any kind of structure or [indiscernible] to that.\n\n---\n\nYes. I'll break it down into Europe, U.S. and Canada. As Ray mentioned, we're very pleased with Europe. So solid fuel growth in what we believe is the flat to slightly declining market and positive traffic in same-store merchandise sales and margins. So really on all fronts there, we think we're taking market share and performing well. U.S., relatively strong merch and very solid fuel, as Raymond mentioned. By all the metrics we look at, whether that be talking to major suppliers or looking at government data, we believe we're outperforming the market on the fuel side. Canada, it's tougher. The Western part performing very solid, and we think we're performing very well versus the general market. The consumer sentiment and spending continue to be a challenge in particularly the eastern half of Canada.\n\n---\n\nSo there's been no structural changes in any of our core markets. At the same time, we continue to try to optimize our pricing practices and then certainly the launch of miles and miles-plus now in some markets, which is a premium product that we're seeing some very good conversion rates, will help bolster overall fuel gross margin going forward. That being said towards the end of the first quarter, we did benefit from -- sorry, from some falling product prices, which did bolster margins in the quarter. And as we've always said, we believe long-term margins will be relatively stable.\n\n---\n\nWell, see the ERP was fully implemented since May 1. Our last division was Poland. We are in the scheduled relation [ph] phase, some synergy related to it are done or will see -- it start to show, but I will say, most of it -- most of the synergies related or following ERP will be materialized going forward.\n\n---\n\nJust as a refresher on that. We initially launched third-party sourcing in Arizona and the Great Lakes 3 years ago, which has led to more recent pilots in 4 additional markets, so in Southeast or Southwest market or West Coast, which is Southern California, and then Midwest, Louisville, Kentucky. So we now have that up and operational in approximately 500 locations in the U.S. Our overall, if you look at the U.S., I think food is about 17.5% of total merchandise gross margin dollars. But if you look at the initial 2 markets that we've launched in Arizona and the Great Lakes 3 years ago, those are closer to 25% of total margin out of food. So we believe we can continue to move the rest of the market toward those numbers. Very pleased with consumer reception. We're seeing good sales growth in really all the key categories we've launched, but we're also proceeding very cautiously, understanding that we've got to get the culture in the stores right about controlling spoilage, understanding food safety and just a very different way of operating with fresh products in the store. So our progress or rollout will be measured. Our next key decision point is actually next month. So our period 6, halfway through our fiscal year. And at that point, we'll make a decision on whether we will roll out to any additional markets. But we have no timetable for completing the North American market at this point.\n\n---\n\nSo those are the main drivers. Excluding cigarettes, there was actually about 100-point improvement. Cigarettes were slightly down quarter-over-quarter while, again, the non-cigarette categories were up about 100 basis points. A change in mix towards higher-margin products accounted for about 15 basis points, and the rest was broadly spread across the remaining categories. And to the question is spot on, really, it's been less promotional activity to drive what we think is an acceptable level of traffic.\n\n---\n\nYes, we're still cautiously optimistic that the consumer sentiment is -- I don't know if I'll call it solid, but certainly improving, plus 2.8%, certainly not as good as the previous quarter. Reasonable, we think, given the different factors for the quarter. Traffic is positive in 6 of our 8 divisions, which is a core metric we look at. And if we look at the 2 that weren't, it was very slight and really tobacco-driven. If you compared to prior quarter, we did have 2 divisions, as I mentioned, that were off significantly, driven by tobacco. So we're reassessing our pricing strategies in those markets and feel that we can get those corrected and feel that we're on track for a very solid year in the U.S. in terms of same-store merchandise.\n\n---\n\nIt's a good point like the -- effectively between Europe it was a little bit -- like publicly a little bit more quiet than basically what we saw in the U.S. That being said, some announcement were made basically in certain countries, and certain assets are available in Denmark and Norway from basically from some of these major fuel retailers. And some of those files were sold over activity basically on the market in the northern part of Europe in the recent months. And I will say that, as you know, we're not giving any specific about any active files, but what you have to have in mind is sometimes some of the files could take some time, like these process could be spread basically over many months even basically sometimes going over a year then. I think it's effective right now in Europe. Some files are available, but we need to be patient to see basically the end results of that.\n\n---\n\nAnd I'd add to that. Two factors that we're learning about in Europe that slowed the process that we really don't face in the U.S. are typically networks are integrated or associated with a refinery. So the major seller, if they're an integrated player, has to find a dual solution. So we see that slowing some of the process we've been involved in. Then there's also a union process, which just has to be followed in many of the countries, so the timetable for transactions is significantly longer.\n\n---\n\nI will say, as previously mentioned, we are in the stabilization phase. This new system will, for sure, improve basically our capacity to get the, I will say, better information quicker and will help us basically to perform, basically on the operating side and to become more efficient. It's a great system. As I said, stabilization mode, but already we're seeing some great basically great output, basically versus the previous system that was not necessarily designed for a retailer.\n\n---\n\nSo I said in an earlier question, we're very happy with the returns of our new industry sites. We're not going to reference a specific return, but I would say, when you look at our overall ROCE, these are certainly accretive projects to that average. Year 1, typically there are some pretty heavy start-up costs. So EBIT contribution wouldn't be anywhere near target. But as you approach year 2 -- go through year 2, you're coming very close to maturity. So we see typically very quick ramp-ups in our projects.\n\n---\n\nI'll say, well, we did get some colors basically on the -- I would say our level of activity results in the environment term of acquisition. I hope that the market is also recognizing basically in our valuation, the great organic potential, offered [ph] the great result we have, but also the great future potential that we have around the organic growth. Just we did talked about the synergy to come, basically the food growth in North America, the top line potential. In general basically, and the company and mainly our -- and also in Europe. The new trend industry pipeline, basically that we did mention basically in this call in the MD&A then. All these factors are clearly factors that will help us to continue in terms of creating values going forward. And my strong belief is, as you know, we're still also an acquirer, but we also have on the other side of the company, the organic side, we did demonstrate in the past with or without acquisition, create our capacity to generate a lot of value basically despite any situation.\n\n---\n\nWith the -- as I give some colors above the -- where we stand with ERP and the fact that we're on the stabilization mode, I will say, as I mentioned before, the acceleration of the synergy, I will -- you will start to see an acceleration of the synergy, I will say, impacted by the European implementation.\n\n---\n\nAgain, we're still basically communicating a range, and I will comment on the range. We're still confident, as I mentioned in our public-declared documents, we will achieve basically clearly our range. And you should see an acceleration in the second part of this year, fiscal year, until the end of the next year, calendar year. That being said, you also need to have in mind that the improvement and the continuous, basically, process of gain in terms of efficiency would also continue after that date's done. This target basically is a target that we're confident to achieve. But you have to have in mind that we'll continue to create value with these assets after -- even after December 2015.\n\n---\n\nYes. The largest single driver for Couche-Tard in the next 12 months will be the European synergies. We expect to, again, as Ray said, accelerate those and achieve our results -- our planned results for the fiscal year. So that's by far the largest effect and a positive one. Minimum wage, we typically pay above minimum wage, but certainly if there is a federal or we see sporadic state increases that will increase the overall wage complex of our employment pool, it's something we're anticipating, something quite honestly we feel needs to happen. Our core consumer is largely a part of the lower income -- lower to middle income consumer base, and we need them to have more money in our pockets. So we actually look forward to some of that. In terms of health care, we've been proactive really for the last 3 years at mitigating those costs, managing the mix of full-time, part-time employees, as well as the structure of our health plan. So we've known it, and we've also seen lower than initially anticipated enrollments. So we don't expect a material impact from health care to show up on our P&L. And then finally on the payment fees, that's going to vary almost linearly with cost of finished product of fuel. First 2 months of the quarter, we would have been above our budget or expectations. As product prices came down late in the quarter and continued down, we'll be under-planned on electronic fees. But again, over time, we view those as much as a fuel tax as anything. We think that eventually either increases or decreases in payment fees, just because of their magnitude, flow through to the consumer.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think we went deep into that on the prior question. So let's -- we'll go to the next one.\n\n---\n\nI will say our policy and approach is more, I would say, in line with the percentage of the free cash flow, and taking also into consideration that we're also -- we're growing company than -- I don't know when you're comparing to the other basically retailers. Actually, you're indiscernible], but it's clearly basically an element like in the recent quarters. We did use basically this money to deleverage our balance sheet. That being said, we review our targets and our basically approach in our fall season in terms of dividends on a continuous basis. But for now, we feel that we're having the right basically approach.\n\n---\n\nI would say I did cover a big portion of this question basically in the previous comments that I made. I will say in terms of differences, that, again, it depends with the countries, it depends with the market, and agency store industry, you have a lot of basically operators are operating without fuel. But again, this will be a very long answer because for each country you have some specific realities then. I will avoid to go too much in detail. So I think the previous answer was basically in line with the question about the fact that we are very flexible, looking active. And as we mentioned in the past, Asia is part basically of the markets where we're actively basically working and looking on different forms of different approach.\n\n---\n\nI will say, if we're focusing on Canada -- I will say in general, the answer to that is we are we always collectively basically -- we put the -- we took an active position about the fact that we would like to see these interchange fees going down. It's a discussion that -- well, see, we did not pertain for many years now. And I think overall you need to understand that if hopefully, eventually we could see something like that happening. It will be to the benefit of our customer because I think it will be best to [ph] as it is today basically in the price of the different product that involve basically payments with credit card. Then I will say in general, in Canada, even in the U.S., I think the pressure is still the same. I think the retailers in general are challenged with the size or the level of the interchange fees and would like to see that basically changing. And some different measure are taken right now to try to influence the future of these things. Then hopefully we will be able to participate as we did in the past actively to find our fit to promote that and also to find solution for the future.\n\n---\n\nAnd just to maybe add, Ray. We're supporting both legislative and legal actions that would help control what we think are out-of-control rates, particularly in the U.S. when compared to other countries that we deal with in the world. And then we're also looking actively and watching for technologies that will help break the duopoly that we think exists between Visa and MasterCard. So paying close attention, and we'll jump on opportunities as technologies present themselves.\n\n---\n\nI think that will be the answer basically to the fact that we're anticipating an acceleration in the second part of fiscal year and also the calendar year next year. In terms of the major driver, we're not going so much into details. But I could assure you that it's a pretty detailed plan, and it's the plan that we follow on a regular basis to make sure that we're on track. And as you can appreciate, it's also basically a plan that moved through at times, and we're adding basically new elements to it. And that's pretty active and pretty -- we're very active with the programs around that. But our team basically, internal payment are up, are doing a great, great job. That was already started basically years ago, and we continue to the very great results and very confident, as I mentioned earlier basically about our targets and also about the future. Not just basically the targets that we did publish, but it will be basically a process that will follow and we'll continue through the time.\n\n---\n\nThank you very much.\n\n---\n\nThank you.",

But for now, we feel that we're having the right basically approach.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nI would say I did cover a big portion of this question basically in the previous comments that I made. I will say in terms of differences, that, again, it depends with the countries, it depends with the market, and agency store industry, you have a lot of basically operators are operating without fuel. But again, this will be a very long answer because for each country you have some specific realities then. I will avoid to go too much in detail. So I think the previous answer was basically in line with the question about the fact that we are very flexible, looking active. And as we mentioned in the past, Asia is part basically of the markets where we're actively basically working and looking on different forms of different approach.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nI will say, if we're focusing on Canada -- I will say in general, the answer to that is we are we always collectively basically -- we put the -- we took an active position about the fact that we would like to see these interchange fees going down. It's a discussion that -- well, see, we did not pertain for many years now. And I think overall you need to understand that if hopefully, eventually we could see something like that happening. It will be to the benefit of our customer because I think it will be best to [ph] as it is today basically in the price of the different product that involve basically payments with credit card. Then I will say in general, in Canada, even in the U.S., I think the pressure is still the same. I think the retailers in general are challenged with the size or the level of the interchange fees and would like to see that basically changing. And some different measure are taken right now to try to influence the future of these things. Then hopefully we will be able to participate as we did in the past actively to find our fit to promote that and also to find solution for the future.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nAnd just to maybe add, Ray. We're supporting both legislative and legal actions that would help control what we think are out-of-control rates, particularly in the U.S. when compared to other countries that we deal with in the world. And then we're also looking actively and watching for technologies that will help break the duopoly that we think exists between Visa and MasterCard. So paying close attention, and we'll jump on opportunities as technologies present themselves.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nI think that will be the answer basically to the fact that we're anticipating an acceleration in the second part of fiscal year and also the calendar year next year. In terms of the major driver, we're not going so much into details. But I could assure you that it's a pretty detailed plan, and it's the plan that we follow on a regular basis to make sure that we're on track. And as you can appreciate, it's also basically a plan that moved through at times, and we're adding basically new elements to it. And that's pretty active and pretty -- we're very active with the programs around that. But our team basically, internal payment are up, are doing a great, great job. That was already started basically years ago, and we continue to the very great results and very confident, as I mentioned earlier basically about our targets and also about the future. Not just basically the targets that we did publish, but it will be basically a process that will follow and we'll continue through the time.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nThank you very much.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alain Bouchard (Executives)】\nThank you.",

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.\r\nRegarding the fourth quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.\r\nTo begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another solid quarter and year. 2014 was a very busy and productive year for us. We've been growing our business on a variety of fronts. Our U.S. retail business expanded again in 2014 with the opening of another 148 new stores. Our commercial business continues to gain traction, growing sales 12.8% on a 52-week basis with 424 net new programs opened.\r\nWe now have a commercial program in 77% of our domestic stores, having opened 792 new programs in just the past 2 years alone. And we continue to expand our presence in Mexico. This quarter, we celebrated the opening of our 400th store in Mexico. We opened 1 additional store in Brazil and now have 5 stores in operation. We currently have approximately 8% of our total stores outside of the U.S., and we believe we have growth opportunities in the United States and beyond for many years to come.\r\nWe also expanded our online offerings in both our traditional autozone.com and autozonepro.com websites, as well as AutoAnything in fiscal 2014. ALLDATA introduced several new products and also continued its expansion in Europe this past year.\r\nAlong with these strategic investments, we spent a lot of time on our core domestic retail business. Our DIY business remains the largest portion of our sales and continues to generate tremendous returns. We continue to see significant opportunities for new store growth and improved productivity in our existing stores. This continues to be our #1 priority. As our commercial business continues to grow, and it is intertwined with our retail business, we continue to identify opportunities to optimize our inventory placement and distribution strategy in order to respond to the ever-increasing challenge of parts proliferation in our industry.\r\nWe began testing a new methodology last year to improve our hard parts placement techniques in all stores. During this past fiscal year, we completed our testing and implemented this new approach. We've been able to add additional products while removing unproductive inventory at an accelerated rate compared to our previous methodology. This has resulted in an increase to our store level inventory. This increased movement of inventory has also resulted in higher distribution costs.\r\nWe've been pleased with our results to date, but continue to refine the new process. As we've mentioned during our last quarterly call, we've been testing different delivery frequencies, primarily from our distribution centers. We've been encouraged by the preliminary results, although we still have more work to do in order to determine the optimal go-forward strategy. Our tests have shown us that increased delivery frequency increases sales and improves inventory productivity by reducing safety stock. We now have implemented additional tests to validate our initial findings and provide us with sufficient data to develop the optimal approach.\r\nWhile we were more aggressive with our inventory additions this past year, we feel future investments will be more targeted and refined. We believe our growth in inventory per store will continue but at a more modest pace than last year. As we carefully analyze all of our tests, we expect to have more to discuss in each of the next several quarters.\r\nAs we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement, we must ensure we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. This process requires us to have a high degree of confidence in our plans before executing on a broad basis.\r\nWe'll be holding our national sales meeting in Memphis next week. All week and, again, during my address to the team at the conclusion of the event, we are introducing the idea of \"Wow every customer, everywhere.\" We have always been focused on service, but this annual operating theme adds intensity and renewed focus.\r\nWe spent significant systems -- we've made significant systems enhancements and investments this year in order to capture data about our customer shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We understand we have to be able to toggle between the store, the shop, the phone and online in order to meet our customers' needs. We also emphasized our ongoing inventory availability tests and what they will mean for availability in 2015.\r\nI'd like to take a moment to discuss our pending acquisition of Interamerican Motor Corporation, doing business in the marketplace as IMC. They are the second-largest distributor of OE quality import replacement parts in the United States. They specialize in parts coverage for European and Asian vehicles. While considerably smaller than the #1 participant in the industry, IMC, with 17 branches today, offers an impressive growth opportunity for us, not just because of the parts coverage, but also because of the strong management team. They are an exceptional team.\r\nWe do not believe there is a significant overlap with our current commercial customer base and IMC's. This new customer base is one of the reasons we are excited about this acquisition. This is a segment of the service repair population that demands OE quality. While we are comfortable with our ability to grow our current business with our existing model, IMC will be a nice complement to our commercial strategy. We expect to open a handful of IMC locations in the new fiscal year, while also making the IMC parts catalog available to our domestic store base as soon as possible. We also believe we can help IMC improve its store level economics. I do want to stress, we will be diligent with our growth strategies here and make sure our financial hurdles are reached as we grow. We look forward to welcoming the entire IMC team to the AutoZone family soon.\r\nNow let's turn to our fourth quarter results. Our sales decreased 1.5%, but on a comparable 16-week basis, they were up 4.5%. Our domestic same-store sales were up 2.1%. This quarter sales results can be summed up in one word: Inconsistent. While May was quite strong and June was decent, July was not as strong. August improved, but results were still quite inconsistent from 1 week to the next. We attribute much of this volatility to both unique weather and the belief that the low-end consumer continues to struggle. We are happy to have run both positive retail and commercial comp sales for the quarter, but expected a stronger sales performance in Q4 than we delivered.\r\nRegionally, the Northeast and Midwest performed better than the overall chain. However, these 2 markets experienced similar volatility to the rest of the country in July and August. While our failure-related merchandise categories continued to perform well, our maintenance-related categories were below our expectations. We attribute much of this category's underperformance to unseasonably mild weather in July and August.\r\nSecondly, in regards to traffic versus ticket in the DIY business, traffic was negative, while ticket was up. The decline in traffic was primarily attributable to the slowdown of our maintenance product sales. After growing lower than our historical norms over the last year, average ticket growth accelerated in Q4.\r\nThird, we opened 113 new commercial programs in the quarter versus 173 programs last year. For the year, we opened 424 net programs for the full year, reaching 77% of our domestic store base. To put our growth in the commercial business in perspective, at the end of 2011, we reported $1.08 billion in total sales compared to $1.61 billion in 2014, up 50% in 3 years.\r\nLastly, I always like to recognize how effective our team delivers consistent earnings in good sales environments and not so good, and that practice has allowed us to deliver an impressive 32 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. That consistently allows us to be both shareholder-friendly with solid earnings growth and bondholder-friendly through a targeted investment grade rating and strong cash flow. We continue to manage this business for both short-term and long-term optimum performance.\r\nAs part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers, this past quarter, we opened 5 additional hub locations. Over time, we do expect to open more hub locations, but we believe our strategy on inventory deployment at the store level allows us to keep the number of openings at a moderate level.\r\nRegarding Mexico, we opened 28 stores this quarter and reached a milestone of surpassing the 400-store mark. Our sales in the other businesses for the quarter were down slightly year-over-year on a 16- versus 17-week basis. However, as a reminder, ALLDATA and eCommerce, which includes autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales.\r\nRegarding online sales opportunities, there continue to be great opportunities for growth on both the business-to-business and to individual consumers or B2C. While these businesses are small for us at just 3.6% of our total sales mix on the quarter, we expect these businesses to grow at a faster rate than our brick-and-mortar business for the foreseeable future.\r\nWith the continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for the industry in both DIY and DIFM. While new car sales have been very strong these past 2 years, we have seen those traded-in vehicles be resold to new owners who are repairing or enhancing their new vehicles. With gas prices, on average, flat year-over-year for the fourth quarter, we see miles driven relatively flat as well. As prices at the pump have recently been declining, we expect this to benefit our customers, especially those most financially strapped. The low-end consumer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging. \r\nI know with the new year upon us, many investors have asked us about our expectations for 2015 relative to the more difficult comparisons our industry will have in the upcoming winter months. For us, our second and third quarter results are more difficult comparisons. However, we are optimistic we can grow in all our upcoming quarters. While certain markets outperformed during the winter, this past year, others underperformed. We believe we should improve in those regions.\r\nAs our history has shown, we manage this business focusing on both the long term and the short term, and it felt -- and we felt our sales would be challenged in the short term -- if we felt our sales to be challenged in the short term due to difficult comparisons, we wouldn't make material changes to our plan or operations. We will continue to balance short-term and long-term performance and will be keenly focused on delivering consistent strong performance and extending our streak of 32 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth.\r\nNow let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2014: Creating Customers for Life. The key priorities for the year were: one, Great People Providing Great Service!; two, profitably growing our commercial business; three, leveraging the Internet; four, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies; and five, improving inventory availability.\r\nOn the retail front this past quarter, under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. This past year, we rolled out our -- rolled out improvements to our electronic parts catalog. While this was rolled out to our chain early in the calendar year, we learned some things as the year went on. We made some modifications along the way. These changes were around how we display product on the screen and presented all the items necessary to do the job right. These upgrades and our other ongoing ones to the systems, we believe, have created the best-selling tool in our industry and our store AutoZoners agree. We look forward to updating you on the results in upcoming conference calls.\r\nBehind the scenes, we have reset our expectations on technology investment and challenged ourselves to make sure our offerings are relevant across all shopping platforms. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. \r\nIn regards to commercial, we opened 113 programs during the quarter. For the year, we opened 424 versus 368 last year. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs and grow our percentage of stores with the commercial program, although our pace of growth will likely moderate.\r\nAs we continue to improve our product assortment and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow. Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative.\r\nWe should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish 2014 at 31.9%. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hardlines retailers. However, our primary focus has been, and continues to be, that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship, as the capital we invest is our investors' capital.\r\nBefore I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank and state how proud we are of our entire organization's efforts to manage this business appropriately and prudently. We have an amazing team, and our initiatives for 2015 are exciting. With our ongoing supply chain initiatives, as well as an incorporation and expansion of our acquisition of IMC, we are ready to continue to provide WOW! Customer Service to all our customers, and we are ready to continue to prudently manage our cost structure, providing our shareholders with the consistency we have exhibited in the past.\r\nNow here's Bill.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and our international results for the quarter.\r\nFor the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico stores and our 5 stores in Brazil, increased 4.5% on a 16-week per [ph] 16-week basis. Including last year's extra week, our sales decreased 1.5%.\r\nNow regarding macro trends, during the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $3.67 a gallon and ended the quarter at $3.46 a gallon, a $0.21 decrease. Last year, gas prices increased $0.07 per gallon through the -- during the fourth quarter, starting at $3.54 and ending at $3.61 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' abilities to maintain their vehicles. And as cost reductions help All-Americans, we hope to benefit from some increase in disposable income.\r\nWe also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased in both May and June. July and August data is not available yet. The other statistic we highlight is a number of 7-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. For the trailing 4 quarters, total sales per auto parts store was $1,724,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry.\r\nFor the quarter, total commercial sales increased 5.3%. On a comparable basis, commercial sales increased 11.5%. For the fourth quarter, commercial represented 18% of our total sales and grew $27 million over last year's Q4. Last year's commercial sales mix percent was 16%.\r\nThis past quarter, we opened 113 new programs versus 173 programs opened in our fourth quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 3,845 stores, supported by 166 hub stores. Approximately 1,200 of our programs are 3 years old or younger.\r\nLet me take a moment to discuss our commercial program performance. While our average sales per program is below some peers in our industry at $8,500, it has grown more than 30% since 2009. It's important to highlight that we accelerated our new program growth over the past few years, as approximately 30% of our programs are younger than 3 years old. These openings have impacted our average sales metric and cannibalized some of our older programs. However, our focus is on growing market share and improving our service levels by having more programs closer to our customers.\r\nLooking specifically at our mature programs, those at least 5 years old, they average $10,000 in weekly sales this past year and also experienced steady growth each of the last 5 years. This year's growth versus last year slowed in these programs but were nicely positive. We still have significant opportunity to open additional programs over the next several years. At the same time, we will remain focused on improving the productivity of all our existing programs. While we can always do better, we feel very good about the success we've had in profitably growing the commercial business. With our inventory additions and the support of the IMC acquisition, we are well-positioned to grow our base business.\r\nOver the last several years, a significant amount of our focus has been on opening new programs, and that will continue to be the case, albeit at a slightly moderated pace. However, we are heightening our emphasis on increasing sales in our more mature store base in fiscal 2015. We have a very talented sales force, and we are enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of the sales force. We have increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends.\r\nIn summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We believe we are well-positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share.\r\nThe trailing -- at this point, our assumption is -- I'm sorry, let me just move on to Mexico for a second. Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened 28 new stores during the fourth quarter and 40 for the full year. We currently have 402 stores in Mexico. Exceeding 400 stores is a terrific milestone, and we congratulate all AutoZoners involved in Mexico on this achievement. We look forward to years of growth here. Our returns and profit growth continue to be in line with our expectations.\r\nNow regarding Brazil, we opened 1 store in the quarter and have 5 stores open at the end of the year. Our plans remain to open a few more stores and then refine our offerings and prove that our concept works for our customers and is financially viable. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we are operating currently at a loss. This is due, as expected, to having such a small store base and carrying a distribution center and overhead that can handle far more stores. Once we refine our offerings in operations and evaluate the performance, we will talk more on our long-term growth plans.\r\nRecapping this past quarter's performance for the company, in total, our sales were $3,550,000,000, an increase of 4.5% on a comparable 16-week basis from last year's fourth quarter. Domestic same-store sales, or sales for stores open more than 1 year, were up 2.1% for the quarter.\r\nGross margin for the quarter was 52.3% of sales, up 48 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs and lower shrink expense, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives.\r\nIn regards to inflation, it has been basically nonexistent year-over-year. This is different than in past years. At this point, our assumption is we'll experience subdued producer pricing heading into the calendar year, and therefore, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We remain cognizant of our future developments regarding inflation, and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise.\r\nLooking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the retail and commercial businesses. However, we do not manage to a targeted gross margin percentage. As the growth of our commercial business has been the steady headwind on our overall gross margin rate for a few years, we have not specifically called out the headwind quarterly. It is part of our business model, and we understand we have to manage that headwind as the business grows.\r\nAdditionally, IMC will be a slight drag on gross margins as this business model operates at a lower gross margin rate. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.\r\nSG&A for the quarter was 31.6% of sales, higher by 37 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a combination of deleverage from the 17th week of sales last year, higher incentive compensation and planned information system investments. IMC will also have a slight impact on SG&A dollars in the upcoming quarters, while these expenses will cause slight deleverage and we expect they will have lasting benefits to the overall organization. We continue to believe we are well-positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.\r\nEBIT for the quarter was $630 million, down 0.9% over last year's fourth quarter. Our EBIT margin improved to 20.7%. Excluding the extra week, our EBIT margin was up 22 basis points, and our EBIT dollars grew by 5.7%. Interest expense for the quarter was $49.4 million compared with $57.4 million on a comparable basis in Q4 a year ago.\r\nDebt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,344,000,000 or approximately $160 million more than last year's balance of $4,187,000,000. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. And share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.\r\nFor the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.7%, up from last year's fourth quarter. We expect our annual rate to be closer to 36.7% on an ongoing basis, as the deviation in result is primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arise.\r\nNet income for the quarter was $374 million. Excluding the extra week, net income was up 7.4%. Our diluted share count of 33.1 million was down 7% from last year's fourth quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $11.28, up 15.6% over the prior year's fourth quarter on a comparable basis.\r\nRelating to the cash flow statement for the fourth fiscal quarter, we generated $370 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 8% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $176 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 113 new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodels, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments.\r\nFor all of fiscal 2014, our CapEx was approximately $440 million. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 4,984 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 402 stores in Mexico; and 5 in Brazil, for a total store count of 5,391.\r\nDepreciation totaled $79 million for the quarter versus last year's fourth quarter expense of $71 million, in line with recent growth quarters. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $188 million of AutoZone stock in the fourth quarter. This is lower than last year's buyback with the extra week last year, and the EBITDA it generated provided additional leverage capacity. At year end, we had $869 million remaining under our share buyback authorization, and our leverage metric was 2.5x. \r\nAgain, I want to stress, we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable, as a percent of gross inventory, finished the quarter at 115%.\r\nNext, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $3.1 billion, up 10% versus Q4 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects new store growth along with additional investments and coverage. Inventory per store was up 5.8% at $582,000 per store, reflecting our continued investments in hard parts coverage. This per-store amount was down from Q3's $594,000 per store.\r\nFinally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 31.9%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.\r\nNow I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Bill. We are pleased to report our 32nd consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, and for the year, to report an EPS growth rate of 16.3% on a comparable 52-week basis. Our company has continued to be successful over the long run. That success is attributable to our approach of leveraging our unique and powerful culture in focusing on the needs of our customers. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. While we study the external environment and react where appropriate, we must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution.\r\nBefore I conclude, I want to take this opportunity to reflect on fiscal 2014. We were able to build on past accomplishments and delivered some impressive results. In recognition of the dedication, passion and commitment of our AutoZoners, I want to highlight that in 2014, we grew sales in all of our businesses. With this growth, we were able to achieve and comfortably surpass the $9 billion annual sales milestone for the first time on a 52-week basis.\r\nAs previously mentioned, we opened our 400th store in Mexico. We reached a definitive agreement to acquire IMC. We believe IMC is the right business at the right time for us. The management team at IMC is exceptional, and we can't wait to grow the business for many years to come.\r\nOur inventory availability testing at hub store remodels have been nothing short of incredible. We've learned a tremendous amount and believe our findings will lead us to a more productive model.\r\nWe are talking more than ever about innovation. As the industry leader, it is imperative that we stay ahead, making sure every aspect of our offering has improved, from inventory assortments, to our commercial offerings, to leveraging the power of information technology enhancements. We can leave no stone unturned. We invested more in information systems infrastructure this past year than in recent memory, an investment that will pay dividends for years to come.\r\nAt the end of the day, our customers have choices, and we must innovate to ensure they turn to us for their vehicle needs. Again, we are excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, eCommerce, Brazil and now, IMC. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leveraged our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits.\r\nWe feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid, consistent strategy, combined with superior execution, is a formula for success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves.\r\nWe are pleased with our results this past year, but we must remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives. I can't wait to sit down and talk with our leadership team at our upcoming national sales meeting. This team is comprised of the best leaders in our industry. We are launching our \"Wow every customer, everywhere\" theme, and I know our leaders, combined with our talented team of more than 70,000 AutoZoners, will do just that.\r\nNow we'd like to open up the call for questions.",

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.\r\nRegarding the fourth quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.\r\nTo begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for another solid quarter and year. 2014 was a very busy and productive year for us. We've been growing our business on a variety of fronts. Our U.S. retail business expanded again in 2014 with the opening of another 148 new stores. Our commercial business continues to gain traction, growing sales 12.8% on a 52-week basis with 424 net new programs opened.\r\nWe now have a commercial program in 77% of our domestic stores, having opened 792 new programs in just the past 2 years alone. And we continue to expand our presence in Mexico. This quarter, we celebrated the opening of our 400th store in Mexico. We opened 1 additional store in Brazil and now have 5 stores in operation. We currently have approximately 8% of our total stores outside of the U.S., and we believe we have growth opportunities in the United States and beyond for many years to come.\r\nWe also expanded our online offerings in both our traditional autozone.com and autozonepro.com websites, as well as AutoAnything in fiscal 2014. ALLDATA introduced several new products and also continued its expansion in Europe this past year.\r\nAlong with these strategic investments, we spent a lot of time on our core domestic retail business. Our DIY business remains the largest portion of our sales and continues to generate tremendous returns. We continue to see significant opportunities for new store growth and improved productivity in our existing stores. This continues to be our #1 priority. As our commercial business continues to grow, and it is intertwined with our retail business, we continue to identify opportunities to optimize our inventory placement and distribution strategy in order to respond to the ever-increasing challenge of parts proliferation in our industry.\r\nWe began testing a new methodology last year to improve our hard parts placement techniques in all stores. During this past fiscal year, we completed our testing and implemented this new approach. We've been able to add additional products while removing unproductive inventory at an accelerated rate compared to our previous methodology. This has resulted in an increase to our store level inventory. This increased movement of inventory has also resulted in higher distribution costs.\r\nWe've been pleased with our results to date, but continue to refine the new process. As we've mentioned during our last quarterly call, we've been testing different delivery frequencies, primarily from our distribution centers. We've been encouraged by the preliminary results, although we still have more work to do in order to determine the optimal go-forward strategy. Our tests have shown us that increased delivery frequency increases sales and improves inventory productivity by reducing safety stock. We now have implemented additional tests to validate our initial findings and provide us with sufficient data to develop the optimal approach.\r\nWhile we were more aggressive with our inventory additions this past year, we feel future investments will be more targeted and refined. We believe our growth in inventory per store will continue but at a more modest pace than last year. As we carefully analyze all of our tests, we expect to have more to discuss in each of the next several quarters.\r\nAs we continue to manage this organization to provide exceptional service for our customers, provide our AutoZoners with a great place to work with opportunities for advancement, we must ensure we do it on a profitable basis to provide strong returns for our shareholders. This process requires us to have a high degree of confidence in our plans before executing on a broad basis.\r\nWe'll be holding our national sales meeting in Memphis next week. All week and, again, during my address to the team at the conclusion of the event, we are introducing the idea of \"Wow every customer, everywhere.\" We have always been focused on service, but this annual operating theme adds intensity and renewed focus.\r\nWe spent significant systems -- we've made significant systems enhancements and investments this year in order to capture data about our customer shopping patterns across all of our platforms. We understand we have to be able to toggle between the store, the shop, the phone and online in order to meet our customers' needs. We also emphasized our ongoing inventory availability tests and what they will mean for availability in 2015.\r\nI'd like to take a moment to discuss our pending acquisition of Interamerican Motor Corporation, doing business in the marketplace as IMC. They are the second-largest distributor of OE quality import replacement parts in the United States. They specialize in parts coverage for European and Asian vehicles. While considerably smaller than the #1 participant in the industry, IMC, with 17 branches today, offers an impressive growth opportunity for us, not just because of the parts coverage, but also because of the strong management team. They are an exceptional team.\r\nWe do not believe there is a significant overlap with our current commercial customer base and IMC's. This new customer base is one of the reasons we are excited about this acquisition. This is a segment of the service repair population that demands OE quality. While we are comfortable with our ability to grow our current business with our existing model, IMC will be a nice complement to our commercial strategy. We expect to open a handful of IMC locations in the new fiscal year, while also making the IMC parts catalog available to our domestic store base as soon as possible. We also believe we can help IMC improve its store level economics. I do want to stress, we will be diligent with our growth strategies here and make sure our financial hurdles are reached as we grow. We look forward to welcoming the entire IMC team to the AutoZone family soon.\r\nNow let's turn to our fourth quarter results. Our sales decreased 1.5%, but on a comparable 16-week basis, they were up 4.5%. Our domestic same-store sales were up 2.1%. This quarter sales results can be summed up in one word: Inconsistent. While May was quite strong and June was decent, July was not as strong. August improved, but results were still quite inconsistent from 1 week to the next. We attribute much of this volatility to both unique weather and the belief that the low-end consumer continues to struggle. We are happy to have run both positive retail and commercial comp sales for the quarter, but expected a stronger sales performance in Q4 than we delivered.\r\nRegionally, the Northeast and Midwest performed better than the overall chain. However, these 2 markets experienced similar volatility to the rest of the country in July and August. While our failure-related merchandise categories continued to perform well, our maintenance-related categories were below our expectations. We attribute much of this category's underperformance to unseasonably mild weather in July and August.\r\nSecondly, in regards to traffic versus ticket in the DIY business, traffic was negative, while ticket was up. The decline in traffic was primarily attributable to the slowdown of our maintenance product sales. After growing lower than our historical norms over the last year, average ticket growth accelerated in Q4.\r\nThird, we opened 113 new commercial programs in the quarter versus 173 programs last year. For the year, we opened 424 net programs for the full year, reaching 77% of our domestic store base. To put our growth in the commercial business in perspective, at the end of 2011, we reported $1.08 billion in total sales compared to $1.61 billion in 2014, up 50% in 3 years.\r\nLastly, I always like to recognize how effective our team delivers consistent earnings in good sales environments and not so good, and that practice has allowed us to deliver an impressive 32 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. That consistently allows us to be both shareholder-friendly with solid earnings growth and bondholder-friendly through a targeted investment grade rating and strong cash flow. We continue to manage this business for both short-term and long-term optimum performance.\r\nAs part of our strategy of increasing inventory levels in local markets closer to our customers, this past quarter, we opened 5 additional hub locations. Over time, we do expect to open more hub locations, but we believe our strategy on inventory deployment at the store level allows us to keep the number of openings at a moderate level.\r\nRegarding Mexico, we opened 28 stores this quarter and reached a milestone of surpassing the 400-store mark. Our sales in the other businesses for the quarter were down slightly year-over-year on a 16- versus 17-week basis. However, as a reminder, ALLDATA and eCommerce, which includes autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales.\r\nRegarding online sales opportunities, there continue to be great opportunities for growth on both the business-to-business and to individual consumers or B2C. While these businesses are small for us at just 3.6% of our total sales mix on the quarter, we expect these businesses to grow at a faster rate than our brick-and-mortar business for the foreseeable future.\r\nWith the continued aging of the car population, we continue to be optimistic regarding trends for the industry in both DIY and DIFM. While new car sales have been very strong these past 2 years, we have seen those traded-in vehicles be resold to new owners who are repairing or enhancing their new vehicles. With gas prices, on average, flat year-over-year for the fourth quarter, we see miles driven relatively flat as well. As prices at the pump have recently been declining, we expect this to benefit our customers, especially those most financially strapped. The low-end consumer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging. \r\nI know with the new year upon us, many investors have asked us about our expectations for 2015 relative to the more difficult comparisons our industry will have in the upcoming winter months. For us, our second and third quarter results are more difficult comparisons. However, we are optimistic we can grow in all our upcoming quarters. While certain markets outperformed during the winter, this past year, others underperformed. We believe we should improve in those regions.\r\nAs our history has shown, we manage this business focusing on both the long term and the short term, and it felt -- and we felt our sales would be challenged in the short term -- if we felt our sales to be challenged in the short term due to difficult comparisons, we wouldn't make material changes to our plan or operations. We will continue to balance short-term and long-term performance and will be keenly focused on delivering consistent strong performance and extending our streak of 32 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth.\r\nNow let me review our highlights regarding execution of our operating theme for 2014: Creating Customers for Life. The key priorities for the year were: one, Great People Providing Great Service!; two, profitably growing our commercial business; three, leveraging the Internet; four, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies; and five, improving inventory availability.\r\nOn the retail front this past quarter, under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. This past year, we rolled out our -- rolled out improvements to our electronic parts catalog. While this was rolled out to our chain early in the calendar year, we learned some things as the year went on. We made some modifications along the way. These changes were around how we display product on the screen and presented all the items necessary to do the job right. These upgrades and our other ongoing ones to the systems, we believe, have created the best-selling tool in our industry and our store AutoZoners agree. We look forward to updating you on the results in upcoming conference calls.\r\nBehind the scenes, we have reset our expectations on technology investment and challenged ourselves to make sure our offerings are relevant across all shopping platforms. We realize as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. Our current and future technology investments will lead to sales growth across all of our businesses. \r\nIn regards to commercial, we opened 113 programs during the quarter. For the year, we opened 424 versus 368 last year. Our expectation is we will continue to open new programs and grow our percentage of stores with the commercial program, although our pace of growth will likely moderate.\r\nAs we continue to improve our product assortment and availability and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the estimated sales potential from the market will grow. Our results continue to provide us confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative.\r\nWe should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish 2014 at 31.9%. We are very pleased with this metric as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hardlines retailers. However, our primary focus has been, and continues to be, that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship, as the capital we invest is our investors' capital.\r\nBefore I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to thank and state how proud we are of our entire organization's efforts to manage this business appropriately and prudently. We have an amazing team, and our initiatives for 2015 are exciting. With our ongoing supply chain initiatives, as well as an incorporation and expansion of our acquisition of IMC, we are ready to continue to provide WOW! Customer Service to all our customers, and we are ready to continue to prudently manage our cost structure, providing our shareholders with the consistency we have exhibited in the past.\r\nNow here's Bill.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: William Giles (Executives)】\nThanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our retail, commercial and our international results for the quarter.\r\nFor the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic retail and commercial businesses, our Mexico stores and our 5 stores in Brazil, increased 4.5% on a 16-week per [ph] 16-week basis. Including last year's extra week, our sales decreased 1.5%.\r\nNow regarding macro trends, during the quarter, nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $3.67 a gallon and ended the quarter at $3.46 a gallon, a $0.21 decrease. Last year, gas prices increased $0.07 per gallon through the -- during the fourth quarter, starting at $3.54 and ending at $3.61 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' abilities to maintain their vehicles. And as cost reductions help All-Americans, we hope to benefit from some increase in disposable income.\r\nWe also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than on newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased in both May and June. July and August data is not available yet. The other statistic we highlight is a number of 7-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. For the trailing 4 quarters, total sales per auto parts store was $1,724,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry.\r\nFor the quarter, total commercial sales increased 5.3%. On a comparable basis, commercial sales increased 11.5%. For the fourth quarter, commercial represented 18% of our total sales and grew $27 million over last year's Q4. Last year's commercial sales mix percent was 16%.\r\nThis past quarter, we opened 113 new programs versus 173 programs opened in our fourth quarter of last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 3,845 stores, supported by 166 hub stores. Approximately 1,200 of our programs are 3 years old or younger.\r\nLet me take a moment to discuss our commercial program performance. While our average sales per program is below some peers in our industry at $8,500, it has grown more than 30% since 2009. It's important to highlight that we accelerated our new program growth over the past few years, as approximately 30% of our programs are younger than 3 years old. These openings have impacted our average sales metric and cannibalized some of our older programs. However, our focus is on growing market share and improving our service levels by having more programs closer to our customers.\r\nLooking specifically at our mature programs, those at least 5 years old, they average $10,000 in weekly sales this past year and also experienced steady growth each of the last 5 years. This year's growth versus last year slowed in these programs but were nicely positive. We still have significant opportunity to open additional programs over the next several years. At the same time, we will remain focused on improving the productivity of all our existing programs. While we can always do better, we feel very good about the success we've had in profitably growing the commercial business. With our inventory additions and the support of the IMC acquisition, we are well-positioned to grow our base business.\r\nOver the last several years, a significant amount of our focus has been on opening new programs, and that will continue to be the case, albeit at a slightly moderated pace. However, we are heightening our emphasis on increasing sales in our more mature store base in fiscal 2015. We have a very talented sales force, and we are enhancing training and introducing additional technology to optimize the productivity of the sales force. We have increased our efforts around analyzing customer purchasing trends and in-stock trends.\r\nIn summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We believe we are well-positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share.\r\nThe trailing -- at this point, our assumption is -- I'm sorry, let me just move on to Mexico for a second. Our Mexico stores continue to perform well. We opened 28 new stores during the fourth quarter and 40 for the full year. We currently have 402 stores in Mexico. Exceeding 400 stores is a terrific milestone, and we congratulate all AutoZoners involved in Mexico on this achievement. We look forward to years of growth here. Our returns and profit growth continue to be in line with our expectations.\r\nNow regarding Brazil, we opened 1 store in the quarter and have 5 stores open at the end of the year. Our plans remain to open a few more stores and then refine our offerings and prove that our concept works for our customers and is financially viable. While sales growth has been very encouraging, we are operating currently at a loss. This is due, as expected, to having such a small store base and carrying a distribution center and overhead that can handle far more stores. Once we refine our offerings in operations and evaluate the performance, we will talk more on our long-term growth plans.\r\nRecapping this past quarter's performance for the company, in total, our sales were $3,550,000,000, an increase of 4.5% on a comparable 16-week basis from last year's fourth quarter. Domestic same-store sales, or sales for stores open more than 1 year, were up 2.1% for the quarter.\r\nGross margin for the quarter was 52.3% of sales, up 48 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs and lower shrink expense, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives.\r\nIn regards to inflation, it has been basically nonexistent year-over-year. This is different than in past years. At this point, our assumption is we'll experience subdued producer pricing heading into the calendar year, and therefore, we feel costs will be predictable and manageable. We remain cognizant of our future developments regarding inflation, and we'll make the appropriate adjustments should they arise.\r\nLooking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for gross margin expansion within both the retail and commercial businesses. However, we do not manage to a targeted gross margin percentage. As the growth of our commercial business has been the steady headwind on our overall gross margin rate for a few years, we have not specifically called out the headwind quarterly. It is part of our business model, and we understand we have to manage that headwind as the business grows.\r\nAdditionally, IMC will be a slight drag on gross margins as this business model operates at a lower gross margin rate. Our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.\r\nSG&A for the quarter was 31.6% of sales, higher by 37 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a combination of deleverage from the 17th week of sales last year, higher incentive compensation and planned information system investments. IMC will also have a slight impact on SG&A dollars in the upcoming quarters, while these expenses will cause slight deleverage and we expect they will have lasting benefits to the overall organization. We continue to believe we are well-positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.\r\nEBIT for the quarter was $630 million, down 0.9% over last year's fourth quarter. Our EBIT margin improved to 20.7%. Excluding the extra week, our EBIT margin was up 22 basis points, and our EBIT dollars grew by 5.7%. Interest expense for the quarter was $49.4 million compared with $57.4 million on a comparable basis in Q4 a year ago.\r\nDebt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $4,344,000,000 or approximately $160 million more than last year's balance of $4,187,000,000. Our adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While in any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment grade rating and our capital allocation strategy. And share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.\r\nFor the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.7%, up from last year's fourth quarter. We expect our annual rate to be closer to 36.7% on an ongoing basis, as the deviation in result is primarily driven by the resolution of discrete tax items that arise.\r\nNet income for the quarter was $374 million. Excluding the extra week, net income was up 7.4%. Our diluted share count of 33.1 million was down 7% from last year's fourth quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $11.28, up 15.6% over the prior year's fourth quarter on a comparable basis.\r\nRelating to the cash flow statement for the fourth fiscal quarter, we generated $370 million of operating cash flow. Net fixed assets were up 8% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $176 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 113 new stores this quarter, capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodels, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments.\r\nFor all of fiscal 2014, our CapEx was approximately $440 million. With the new stores opened, we finished this past quarter with 4,984 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 402 stores in Mexico; and 5 in Brazil, for a total store count of 5,391.\r\nDepreciation totaled $79 million for the quarter versus last year's fourth quarter expense of $71 million, in line with recent growth quarters. With our excess cash flow, we repurchased $188 million of AutoZone stock in the fourth quarter. This is lower than last year's buyback with the extra week last year, and the EBITDA it generated provided additional leverage capacity. At year end, we had $869 million remaining under our share buyback authorization, and our leverage metric was 2.5x. \r\nAgain, I want to stress, we manage to appropriate credit ratings and not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating firm has its own criteria. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy. Accounts payable, as a percent of gross inventory, finished the quarter at 115%.\r\nNext, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per-store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $3.1 billion, up 10% versus Q4 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects new store growth along with additional investments and coverage. Inventory per store was up 5.8% at $582,000 per store, reflecting our continued investments in hard parts coverage. This per-store amount was down from Q3's $594,000 per store.\r\nFinally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on invested capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 31.9%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.\r\nNow I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nThank you, Bill. We are pleased to report our 32nd consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, and for the year, to report an EPS growth rate of 16.3% on a comparable 52-week basis. Our company has continued to be successful over the long run. That success is attributable to our approach of leveraging our unique and powerful culture in focusing on the needs of our customers. To execute at a high level, we have to consistently adhere to living the pledge. We cannot and will not take our eye off of execution. While we study the external environment and react where appropriate, we must stay committed to executing day in and day out on our game plan. Success will be achieved with an attention to detail and exceptional execution.\r\nBefore I conclude, I want to take this opportunity to reflect on fiscal 2014. We were able to build on past accomplishments and delivered some impressive results. In recognition of the dedication, passion and commitment of our AutoZoners, I want to highlight that in 2014, we grew sales in all of our businesses. With this growth, we were able to achieve and comfortably surpass the $9 billion annual sales milestone for the first time on a 52-week basis.\r\nAs previously mentioned, we opened our 400th store in Mexico. We reached a definitive agreement to acquire IMC. We believe IMC is the right business at the right time for us. The management team at IMC is exceptional, and we can't wait to grow the business for many years to come.\r\nOur inventory availability testing at hub store remodels have been nothing short of incredible. We've learned a tremendous amount and believe our findings will lead us to a more productive model.\r\nWe are talking more than ever about innovation. As the industry leader, it is imperative that we stay ahead, making sure every aspect of our offering has improved, from inventory assortments, to our commercial offerings, to leveraging the power of information technology enhancements. We can leave no stone unturned. We invested more in information systems infrastructure this past year than in recent memory, an investment that will pay dividends for years to come.\r\nAt the end of the day, our customers have choices, and we must innovate to ensure they turn to us for their vehicle needs. Again, we are excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, eCommerce, Brazil and now, IMC. Our long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we look to routinely grow EBIT dollars in the mid-single-digit range or better in times of strength. And we leveraged our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth into double digits.\r\nWe feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid, consistent strategy, combined with superior execution, is a formula for success. Our charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves.\r\nWe are pleased with our results this past year, but we must remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives. I can't wait to sit down and talk with our leadership team at our upcoming national sales meeting. This team is comprised of the best leaders in our industry. We are launching our \"Wow every customer, everywhere\" theme, and I know our leaders, combined with our talented team of more than 70,000 AutoZoners, will do just that.\r\nNow we'd like to open up the call for questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "First question for Bill Rhodes. I mean, as you look longer term with respect to IMC, how should we think of that company long term as a proportion of your revenues? And how will you integrate this at all in a little bit more detail with both your store base as well as AutoAnything?\n\n---\n\nYes. Thank you, Alan. It's a great question. First of all, I want to update everybody that as -- on last Friday, we received HSR clearance, and so we are working towards closing the deal and hopefully can do it in the next week or so. So at this point in time, our integration efforts, as you would expect, as we were going through the regulatory approval process, have been minimal. But we'll start working that diligently as we go forward. With respect to our growth plans, they currently have 17 branches, and there is considerable opportunities for growth. You can look at the other key player in the industry, and they have over 100 branches. So we look to roll out additional branches. Three of their branches are new this year, and they're off to a great start. So we're encouraged about the long term with them. Additionally, we think that they can be leveraged, particularly with our other stores, AutoZone stores, on both the retail and the commercial side. They have a product offering that we don't have today. So we are very excited about them joining the family, and hopefully, that's going to happen in the next week or so.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And one follow-up, if I may, for either of the Bills. Is there any structural reason why your less mature commercial stores, which are doing $8,500 a week, cannot get to the level where some of your more mature units are doing, which is over $10,000 a week?\n\n---\n\nYes, let me clarify that. The $8,500 was on, on average, all of our stores, Alan. So we got the more mature stores are averaging $10,000. The newer stores are even below the $8,500 level. But we've been very pleased that we've continued to grow at a very rapid pace, opening almost 800 new programs in the last 2 years. But those new programs are continuing to perform at or above where they start -- where the older programs started. So we believe we have a long-term opportunity for them to be very productive. We also believe the stores that are doing over $10,000 are nowhere near where they needed to be. We have continued growth opportunities with them.\n\n---\n\nOkay. But just to clarify, Bill, so even though some of the units which you've added most recently, you still think that collectively, over the longer term, they can achieve revenue levels and profitability levels of some of your more mature ones? Is that fair?\n\n---\n\nYes. Yes, that's absolutely fair, and hopefully beyond that, Alan.\n\n---\n\nBill, would you comment -- to follow on, on Alan's question just a little further, that gap of some of those clients or stores where you don't have that merchandise or that line card available, can you just give us a sense of some of those stores and what you'll have available for those that you don't have today and how big of an opportunity -- how large of an opportunity is that?\n\n---\n\nWell, the IMC product offering is vastly different than ours. It is a branded offering that is OE, quality OE manufacturers that we don't necessarily have in our product offering today. There are certain customers, think about the high-end BMW or Mercedes shops that want to use those products and use them pretty much exclusively, we don't do business with many of those shops today. However, we do have a lot of shops that are doing that kind of work and then, in certain cases, want those kind of products. This will now allow us in our commercial program to sell those cases to our existing -- or those products to our existing customers as well.\n\n---\n\nRight. And just a follow-up for Bill Giles. On the G&A, as far as technology investments and incentive comp, should those stay about the same level going forward?\n\n---\n\nI would say that, obviously, from a management team perspective, we hope the incentive comp continues to go up. But I would say that from an IT perspective, we will continue to expect to have some investments in IT over the next fiscal year or so. As Bill highlighted earlier, there's several things that we've done from a store system structure perspective in order to enhance the information that we're providing our AutoZoners, which is ultimately providing to our customers. So we think there's some real opportunity for that, as well as tying all of our customer information together so we have a better visibility on the activities of our customers.\n\n---\n\nBill, we've had 5 consecutive quarters that inventory per square foot has grown between, let's call it, 4.5% to 8.5%. I would have thought by now that these initiatives would have had enough time to get some traction and generate better sales productivity. It sounds like you're continuing to refine the test, particularly regarding distribution frequency. Just curious as to why you think that the payoff hasn't materialized by now, and what kind of time frame would you advise investors to take with a payback?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's a good question, Dan, and I think that you're looking at it the right way. I mean, we recognize the importance of hard parts coverage. And every time we add inventory, we recognize that it benefits both the commercial side of the business, as well as the DIY side of the business. Now keep in mind, too, we're fortunate to be operating in an industry where there's very low obsolescence on inventory and there's very low financing cost at the moment, so we think that this is a very good risk/reward strategy to be taking. And it's an important one for us to continue to gain market share with our customers. One other leg of the stool is really the delivery frequency. So we've added more inventory, particularly at the store level, and then we're also testing our -- the optimization of the frequency of delivery and the method of delivery to both our satellite stores as well as ultimately, to our customers, and so there's more work to be done on there. I think that the tests would show that we've gotten some good returns on the investments that we've made. We've been broad-based in some cases, but frankly, not all across the chain. Many of the tests that we're doing are very isolated. And in those cases, we're very encouraged with the results that we have. There's more learning to be done and there's more work to be done. But we think that adding inventory, like I said before, is very good from a risk/reward perspective. We don't see a lot of exposure because, again, it's not fashion, it's not technology-based, so we think it's a good way to continue to capture market share. And then we got to continue to work with the delivery frequency to optimize our overall supply chain.\n\n---\n\nAnd just to clarify, is there a bottleneck, so we've added this -- we've added inventory either at a distribution center or at a hub, but there's a bottleneck that's preventing it from getting to the store and effectively sold to your commercial customer?\n\n---\n\nI think we have one thing to think about, and we've always talked about this, is that 70% of the SKUs that we carry are one on hand. And so there's an incredible randomness on a lot of the sales of this inventory, so your ability to predict and to stay in stock is what's really becomes challenging. So I wouldn't consider it a bottleneck per se. I think we've got distribution centers, we've got hub stores and we've got our individual stores, and it's really where we have the inventory versus safety stock and then the frequency of delivery, and those are the things that we're working on right now.\n\n---\n\nAnd just one other follow-up question. You noted that the year-over-year comparisons become a lot more difficult in your second quarter of fiscal year '15. But at the same time, you do have some weaker markets that can recover. I'm assuming you're talking about the West Coast. Given the drought conditions out there are expected to continue next year, what makes you confident that those lagging markets would recover this coming year?\n\n---\n\nWell, obviously, we can't predict the future, but we did have a lot of strength in the second quarter, particularly in the Northeast and the Midwest. I would also say it wasn't just a geography issue. In the second quarter of last year, we performed particularly well on the failure-related categories, but even at the time we spoke to the fact that the maintenance-related categories, think about all the undercar things that could be deferred and saw significant decreases. So yes, we had a strong quarter. We had strength in certain categories and certain geographies at the same time. The West was weaker and certain categories were weaker.\n\n---\n\nThe first question I had is just regarding some of your distribution plans. It seemed to me that you're talking a little bit more about testing more overnight, more frequent delivery from the DCs to the stores rather than focusing on utilization of the hubs. Is that correct? And can you give us some more information on your thinking there?\n\n---\n\nYes, that is correct. We have several different tests that are going on. Let me go back and remind you. We talked about something we called optimal hurdle, which was refining the store SKU placements across the entire store network. We finished that testing last summer, and have rolled that out. We've been very pleased with the results of that to date. A couple of the other key tests are would the increase of -- an increase in delivery frequency from our distribution centers to our stores be a productive use? And we've been testing that for about 8 or 9 months now, and so far, we're pretty pleased with the results. Now we're taking it to the next level and saying, okay, let's vary the delivery frequency. Instead of 5 days a week, what happens at 2 days a week, what happens at 3 days a week, so that we can find the optimal approach. We're also testing something, which is an expanded SKU coverage even beyond our hub stores and a select number of, we call them, mega hub stores. And those mega hubs are also servicing the other hub stores in the area, further extending our same-day local market availability. So we're still very much in test phase. We hope to be bringing some of these tests to conclusion over the next several months. And then once we make those decisions, we will communicate them with you.\n\n---\n\nGreat, that's helpful. And just thinking about some of the mature programs, you talked about the growth in these commercial programs still improving, but at a slower rate. What do you think is driving that slowdown, especially given the fact that you're adding a lot of inventory and whatnot? Is there cannibalization going on? Or is it more market dynamics? How do we think about that?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think a big part of it is the cannibalization. As we've opened these new programs, remember, several years ago, we had 51% of our stores that were on the commercial program. We're now at 77%. When we open a program in an existing market, we take the customers that are closer to the new program and we move them to that program. So there's a fairly significant amount of cannibalization that's in there, and that's impacting those growth rates. But overall, we wanted to make it clear to you all, we're making progress and have been over the last 5 years and are pleased with it. It's never going as fast as you want it to.\n\n---\n\nFirst, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that August was better but inconsistent. Can you touch on September, if appropriate? And then looking at August, maybe just the past few months, whether it's weather, mix of business or some secular trends, can you help sort of parse that out? And if there are markets that haven't had any weather noise, can you tell us where the underlying run rate is?\n\n---\n\nYes. As far as August is concerned, let me just say this, every period for us in the quarter had a positive same-store sales growth. August was certainly better than July, which was our weakest point. In September, we have a policy of really not talking about what's going on in this current quarter because we release our earnings so early in the quarter. We're just barely 3 weeks in, and so we don't think it's prudent for us to share what's going on in September so far. As far as what was driving the trajectory, you could very easily see it in the weather and the weather-related categories. So things like A/C chemicals, A/C and heating, cooling systems, all of those categories were weak for the entire quarter and particularly weak in July and in certain select weeks in August. So to us, it was very much when the weather cooperated, our sales were strong; when it didn't, they didn't.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then second, about next year, you were mentioning those tough compares. Can you talk about the comp that's required to lever the expense line? I think the business right now is doing great on the gross margin, so it's helping the gross profit dollars. Has the composition at all changed? Has the SG&A flexed a little bit? And what's the right level for next year?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's a good question, and it's one that I think varies a little bit. I mean, the reality of it is, if you look over time, we're going to adjust our expense structure based on the sales environment that we're operating in. So we're ultimately focused on growing EBIT dollars, and so we'll have some opportunities in gross margin. We may make some investments in SG&A, but we'll manage those over the long term based on the sales environment that we operate on. So it's hard to give you a static number per se because, at times, we've leveraged on very low comps and, at times, we've deleveraged on higher comps. And so we'll just continue to look at the strategies that we have in place and the investments that we think will help us out on a long-term basis, and we'll adjust them based on the sales environment we play in.\n\n---\n\nOkay. The lower acquisition costs that were cited this quarter, is that normal course of business? Or did something else change that triggered your ability to lower the COGS?\n\n---\n\nI would say that that's probably more normal course of business, I think better work with the merchandising organization on lowering some of the acquisition costs either through sourcing. There's probably some deflation in certain categories, and that's probably what's drove it mostly.\n\n---\n\nI was hoping you could benchmark where you think your parts availability and your delivery frequency capabilities are relative to your peers. We know that you've made good, good strides in the last several quarters, but I think the challenge is we don't know really order of magnitude where you are today versus where you were and what you're -- where you're trying to get to.\n\n---\n\nYes. On the delivery frequency, we've had a long strategy of, we deliver the vast majority of our stores once a week. We have competitors that are out there that deliver their stores on a daily basis. We are in the process of testing delivery frequency. And I want to be -- I want to emphasize the word test. We're talking about a few hundred stores that are on this delivery frequency test. So what's going on in those stores is not showing up in our overall numbers in any material way. We're going to go out and see what increased delivery frequency means. As I mentioned earlier, we've been pleased with what we've seen so far, and no surprise. As we get inventory closer, and as Bill mentioned, 70% of our SKUs have one piece on the shelf, normally, in our current structure [ph], if we sell that piece, we're out of it for up to 8 days. This allows us to put it back on the self within 24 hours. So we're encouraged, but we haven't made any final decisions yet.\n\n---\n\nOkay. In those stores where you have increased frequency, what has been the profitability impact? Because presumably, it's a lot more expensive to do that.\n\n---\n\nYes, it is more expensive, and we've got 4 or 5 different tests in different markets right now, and they have mixed results. The longest-running test is showing that it's EBIT positive and that it's generating a 15% ROR or better. So that's the threshold that we're going to hold any investment to. What we're trying to be careful of is these will be some decisions that have long-term ramifications, and so we're wanting to make sure we prudently test them and we validate our test results and then determine what's the right number. Should it be twice a week, should it be 5x a week? We don't know that answer yet.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just to tie all those things together, if you were to get to daily replenishment or multi-week, multi-time per-week replenishment, would you have to necessarily sacrifice your profitability rate in order to do that?\n\n---\n\nI wouldn't say -- we're not going to sacrifice our EBIT growth rate per se. So at the end of the day, this is about driving EBIT dollars and driving an acceptable IRR, which is about 15% for us. So that's kind of the way we think about it. That's the way we focus on it. Is this going to generate us more profit dollars? Are we going to get an adequate return on the investments that we make? And that's kind of how we look at it. So we're not getting hung up on an absolute margin rate per se.\n\n---\n\nI understand that some of the commercial business is kind of cannibalizing from your mature stores. But you're still at 18% of your mix is commercial. I'm not sure whether you have a particular goal of where you'd like to be, but it seems, from just reading and studying the industry, it seems like that wants to go a lot higher. So my question is, is there a reason that you can think of why we're cannibalizing from ourselves rather than taking business from others who seem to be growing there kind of comps from that commercial program? And do you get a sense that we're all kind of just piling into the same strategy at the same time and maybe that's making it more difficult competitively?\n\n---\n\nYes, I would say that cannibalization is just a natural effect. If we are -- if we open a store that is closer to a customer than the existing store that's servicing it, it just makes all the sense in the world for us to move that customer over to the new store so we can service them better. Delivery times will be shorter, and so on, and so forth. So I think it's not that that's the only way we can do it, that's just the natural course of business. Yes, we only have 18% of our sales in stores today. That's up from 16% last year. It's nowhere near where we want it to be. We believe that we have a long-term opportunity to continue to grow commercial in an aggressive way. We have not set any specific number because we don't want to maximize or put a threshold on where we're going. We want to be as big in both businesses as we can be. As far as the piece about growing in this business, I think it just takes time. We've been in this business the shortest amount of time. We've really had a successful growth rate over the last 6 or 7 years, and we're very confident about the fact that we're on with the strategies that we have.\n\n---\n\nAnd on the DIY side, can you tell us a little bit about your market share, whether you feel like you're growing that market share or if that's kind of stagnating or slipping? And then also where does eCommerce fit into that market share equation on the DIY side? Is that beginning to make any material inroads?\n\n---\n\nI think on the eCommerce side, when we look at the industry broad-based, we think that there's some opportunity for online sales, although it isn't a significant penetration like it is in other industries. We recognize that a lot of people are coming for information relative to the content of the product or repair information, et cetera. So we think that it's an integrated approach overall, and that's how we're approaching it. From a market share perspective, I think we're holding our own, and so our growth rate seems to be close to what the overall industry is growing at. At the same time, we're growing square footage growth rate at about 3%. So overall, I think we're holding our own from a market share perspective.\n\n---\n\nMy first question relates to the IMC acquisition. If you could shed a little bit of light on the economics of the business, the revenue per store compared, for example, to a core AutoZone store, the role of online in that business. And then, also, just give us a sense as to the pace and the impact of the prospective rollout of their catalog to your AutoZone stores.\n\n---\n\nI'm seeing overall revenue is around $10 million per location is about what they average overall. And so, as far as what the overall impact would be on us on an ongoing basis, as Bill mentioned before, once we kind of get through the close and get our implementations plans integrated and started, we'll be able to give you a little bit more color. I think in terms of getting them to the catalog, obviously, we would expect that to transpire in fiscal '15, so we expect that to happen sometime in the fiscal year. I'll give you a better idea of that in the next conference call. But overall, it's good productivity. It's a great complement from an inventory perspective and certainly, from a customer perspective, and it's a great management team. So we think those combination of things will help the integration go even quicker.\n\n---\n\nAnd Bill, as you think about the role of eCommerce in your model compared to what you see for the core AutoZone stores, as you discussed to the last question, is it similar or greater, would you say, vis-à-vis your core business today?\n\n---\n\nI would say it's probably a little bit greater. I think that there's an opportunity from an online ordering perspective with commercial customers. I also think that there's probably a broader base from an eCommerce perspective for their product as well. So I think that, that product probably has even more opportunities online.\n\n---\n\nAnd then my second question relates to the pace of the buyback. In recent years, your buyback in the final quarter of the fiscal year has been the largest of the year, I guess, in part due to the length of the quarter, and there might be other reasons, especially with seasonality, et cetera. This year, that was not the case. How should we think about the way you managed the buyback in the quarter this year and what it tells us, if anything, about the pace of buybacks going forward?\n\n---\n\nYes, that's a good question. I mean, we repurchased about $1.1 billion. I think we did about $1.3 billion last year. As we mentioned, the extra week of the quarter last year certainly helped a little bit last year, so that's some of the differential. If you think about it, we bought back about $1 billion over the past 6 years. And so we think that that's a cash flow number that we can maintain going forward, if not better. And we're also consciously trying to spread it out over the year as well and not make it as chunky as it has been. So those are some of the factors that go into that, but I wouldn't think about the fourth quarter as being light in terms of being a trend. I would look at it as $1.1 billion versus $1.3 billion, and the $1.3 billion got used [ph] a little bit with the extra week last year.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Thank you. Before we conclude the call, I'd just like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year. We will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. We thank you for participating in today's call.",

Given the drought conditions out there are expected to continue next year, what makes you confident that those lagging markets would recover this coming year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nWell, obviously, we can't predict the future, but we did have a lot of strength in the second quarter, particularly in the Northeast and the Midwest. I would also say it wasn't just a geography issue. In the second quarter of last year, we performed particularly well on the failure-related categories, but even at the time we spoke to the fact that the maintenance-related categories, think about all the undercar things that could be deferred and saw significant decreases. So yes, we had a strong quarter. We had strength in certain categories and certain geographies at the same time. The West was weaker and certain categories were weaker.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Seth Basham (Analysts)】\nThe first question I had is just regarding some of your distribution plans. It seemed to me that you're talking a little bit more about testing more overnight, more frequent delivery from the DCs to the stores rather than focusing on utilization of the hubs. Is that correct? And can you give us some more information on your thinking there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes, that is correct. We have several different tests that are going on. Let me go back and remind you. We talked about something we called optimal hurdle, which was refining the store SKU placements across the entire store network. We finished that testing last summer, and have rolled that out. We've been very pleased with the results of that to date. A couple of the other key tests are would the increase of -- an increase in delivery frequency from our distribution centers to our stores be a productive use? And we've been testing that for about 8 or 9 months now, and so far, we're pretty pleased with the results. Now we're taking it to the next level and saying, okay, let's vary the delivery frequency. Instead of 5 days a week, what happens at 2 days a week, what happens at 3 days a week, so that we can find the optimal approach. We're also testing something, which is an expanded SKU coverage even beyond our hub stores and a select number of, we call them, mega hub stores. And those mega hubs are also servicing the other hub stores in the area, further extending our same-day local market availability. So we're still very much in test phase. We hope to be bringing some of these tests to conclusion over the next several months. And then once we make those decisions, we will communicate them with you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Seth Basham (Analysts)】\nGreat, that's helpful. And just thinking about some of the mature programs, you talked about the growth in these commercial programs still improving, but at a slower rate. What do you think is driving that slowdown, especially given the fact that you're adding a lot of inventory and whatnot? Is there cannibalization going on? Or is it more market dynamics? How do we think about that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes. I think a big part of it is the cannibalization. As we've opened these new programs, remember, several years ago, we had 51% of our stores that were on the commercial program. We're now at 77%. When we open a program in an existing market, we take the customers that are closer to the new program and we move them to that program. So there's a fairly significant amount of cannibalization that's in there, and that's impacting those growth rates. But overall, we wanted to make it clear to you all, we're making progress and have been over the last 5 years and are pleased with it. It's never going as fast as you want it to.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simeon Gutman (Analysts)】\nFirst, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that August was better but inconsistent. Can you touch on September, if appropriate? And then looking at August, maybe just the past few months, whether it's weather, mix of business or some secular trends, can you help sort of parse that out? And if there are markets that haven't had any weather noise, can you tell us where the underlying run rate is?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes. As far as August is concerned, let me just say this, every period for us in the quarter had a positive same-store sales growth. August was certainly better than July, which was our weakest point. In September, we have a policy of really not talking about what's going on in this current quarter because we release our earnings so early in the quarter. We're just barely 3 weeks in, and so we don't think it's prudent for us to share what's going on in September so far. As far as what was driving the trajectory, you could very easily see it in the weather and the weather-related categories. So things like A/C chemicals, A/C and heating, cooling systems, all of those categories were weak for the entire quarter and particularly weak in July and in certain select weeks in August. So to us, it was very much when the weather cooperated, our sales were strong; when it didn't, they didn't.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simeon Gutman (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then second, about next year, you were mentioning those tough compares. Can you talk about the comp that's required to lever the expense line? I think the business right now is doing great on the gross margin, so it's helping the gross profit dollars. Has the composition at all changed? Has the SG&A flexed a little bit? And what's the right level for next year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nYes, it's a good question, and it's one that I think varies a little bit. I mean, the reality of it is, if you look over time, we're going to adjust our expense structure based on the sales environment that we're operating in. So we're ultimately focused on growing EBIT dollars, and so we'll have some opportunities in gross margin. We may make some investments in SG&A, but we'll manage those over the long term based on the sales environment that we operate on. So it's hard to give you a static number per se because, at times, we've leveraged on very low comps and, at times, we've deleveraged on higher comps. And so we'll just continue to look at the strategies that we have in place and the investments that we think will help us out on a long-term basis, and we'll adjust them based on the sales environment we play in.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simeon Gutman (Analysts)】\nOkay. The lower acquisition costs that were cited this quarter, is that normal course of business? Or did something else change that triggered your ability to lower the COGS?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nI would say that that's probably more normal course of business, I think better work with the merchandising organization on lowering some of the acquisition costs either through sourcing. There's probably some deflation in certain categories, and that's probably what's drove it mostly.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nI was hoping you could benchmark where you think your parts availability and your delivery frequency capabilities are relative to your peers. We know that you've made good, good strides in the last several quarters, but I think the challenge is we don't know really order of magnitude where you are today versus where you were and what you're -- where you're trying to get to.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes. On the delivery frequency, we've had a long strategy of, we deliver the vast majority of our stores once a week. We have competitors that are out there that deliver their stores on a daily basis. We are in the process of testing delivery frequency. And I want to be -- I want to emphasize the word test. We're talking about a few hundred stores that are on this delivery frequency test. So what's going on in those stores is not showing up in our overall numbers in any material way. We're going to go out and see what increased delivery frequency means. As I mentioned earlier, we've been pleased with what we've seen so far, and no surprise. As we get inventory closer, and as Bill mentioned, 70% of our SKUs have one piece on the shelf, normally, in our current structure [ph], if we sell that piece, we're out of it for up to 8 days. This allows us to put it back on the self within 24 hours. So we're encouraged, but we haven't made any final decisions yet.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nOkay. In those stores where you have increased frequency, what has been the profitability impact? Because presumably, it's a lot more expensive to do that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes, it is more expensive, and we've got 4 or 5 different tests in different markets right now, and they have mixed results. The longest-running test is showing that it's EBIT positive and that it's generating a 15% ROR or better. So that's the threshold that we're going to hold any investment to. What we're trying to be careful of is these will be some decisions that have long-term ramifications, and so we're wanting to make sure we prudently test them and we validate our test results and then determine what's the right number. Should it be twice a week, should it be 5x a week? We don't know that answer yet.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just to tie all those things together, if you were to get to daily replenishment or multi-week, multi-time per-week replenishment, would you have to necessarily sacrifice your profitability rate in order to do that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nI wouldn't say -- we're not going to sacrifice our EBIT growth rate per se. So at the end of the day, this is about driving EBIT dollars and driving an acceptable IRR, which is about 15% for us. So that's kind of the way we think about it. That's the way we focus on it. Is this going to generate us more profit dollars? Are we going to get an adequate return on the investments that we make? And that's kind of how we look at it. So we're not getting hung up on an absolute margin rate per se.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Aram Rubinson (Analysts)】\nI understand that some of the commercial business is kind of cannibalizing from your mature stores. But you're still at 18% of your mix is commercial. I'm not sure whether you have a particular goal of where you'd like to be, but it seems, from just reading and studying the industry, it seems like that wants to go a lot higher. So my question is, is there a reason that you can think of why we're cannibalizing from ourselves rather than taking business from others who seem to be growing there kind of comps from that commercial program? And do you get a sense that we're all kind of just piling into the same strategy at the same time and maybe that's making it more difficult competitively?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes, I would say that cannibalization is just a natural effect. If we are -- if we open a store that is closer to a customer than the existing store that's servicing it, it just makes all the sense in the world for us to move that customer over to the new store so we can service them better. Delivery times will be shorter, and so on, and so forth. So I think it's not that that's the only way we can do it, that's just the natural course of business. Yes, we only have 18% of our sales in stores today. That's up from 16% last year. It's nowhere near where we want it to be. We believe that we have a long-term opportunity to continue to grow commercial in an aggressive way. We have not set any specific number because we don't want to maximize or put a threshold on where we're going. We want to be as big in both businesses as we can be. As far as the piece about growing in this business, I think it just takes time. We've been in this business the shortest amount of time. We've really had a successful growth rate over the last 6 or 7 years, and we're very confident about the fact that we're on with the strategies that we have.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Aram Rubinson (Analysts)】\nAnd on the DIY side, can you tell us a little bit about your market share, whether you feel like you're growing that market share or if that's kind of stagnating or slipping? And then also where does eCommerce fit into that market share equation on the DIY side? Is that beginning to make any material inroads?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nI think on the eCommerce side, when we look at the industry broad-based, we think that there's some opportunity for online sales, although it isn't a significant penetration like it is in other industries. We recognize that a lot of people are coming for information relative to the content of the product or repair information, et cetera. So we think that it's an integrated approach overall, and that's how we're approaching it. From a market share perspective, I think we're holding our own, and so our growth rate seems to be close to what the overall industry is growing at. At the same time, we're growing square footage growth rate at about 3%. So overall, I think we're holding our own from a market share perspective.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Fassler (Analysts)】\nMy first question relates to the IMC acquisition. If you could shed a little bit of light on the economics of the business, the revenue per store compared, for example, to a core AutoZone store, the role of online in that business. And then, also, just give us a sense as to the pace and the impact of the prospective rollout of their catalog to your AutoZone stores.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nI'm seeing overall revenue is around $10 million per location is about what they average overall. And so, as far as what the overall impact would be on us on an ongoing basis, as Bill mentioned before, once we kind of get through the close and get our implementations plans integrated and started, we'll be able to give you a little bit more color. I think in terms of getting them to the catalog, obviously, we would expect that to transpire in fiscal '15, so we expect that to happen sometime in the fiscal year. I'll give you a better idea of that in the next conference call. But overall, it's good productivity. It's a great complement from an inventory perspective and certainly, from a customer perspective, and it's a great management team. So we think those combination of things will help the integration go even quicker.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Fassler (Analysts)】\nAnd Bill, as you think about the role of eCommerce in your model compared to what you see for the core AutoZone stores, as you discussed to the last question, is it similar or greater, would you say, vis-à-vis your core business today?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nI would say it's probably a little bit greater. I think that there's an opportunity from an online ordering perspective with commercial customers. I also think that there's probably a broader base from an eCommerce perspective for their product as well. So I think that, that product probably has even more opportunities online.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Fassler (Analysts)】\nAnd then my second question relates to the pace of the buyback. In recent years, your buyback in the final quarter of the fiscal year has been the largest of the year, I guess, in part due to the length of the quarter, and there might be other reasons, especially with seasonality, et cetera. This year, that was not the case. How should we think about the way you managed the buyback in the quarter this year and what it tells us, if anything, about the pace of buybacks going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nYes, that's a good question. I mean, we repurchased about $1.1 billion. I think we did about $1.3 billion last year. As we mentioned, the extra week of the quarter last year certainly helped a little bit last year, so that's some of the differential. If you think about it, we bought back about $1 billion over the past 6 years. And so we think that that's a cash flow number that we can maintain going forward, if not better. And we're also consciously trying to spread it out over the year as well and not make it as chunky as it has been. So those are some of the factors that go into that, but I wouldn't think about the fourth quarter as being light in terms of being a trend. I would look at it as $1.1 billion versus $1.3 billion, and the $1.3 billion got used [ph] a little bit with the extra week last year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nGreat. Thank you. Before we conclude the call, I'd just like to take a moment to reiterate that our business model continues to be solid. We're excited about our growth prospects for the year. We will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year, but I want to stress that this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value, we are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful. We thank you for participating in today's call.",

Joining me on the call today are Bill Cobb, our President and CEO; and Greg Macfarlane, our CFO. \r\nIn connection with this call, we have posted today's press release on the Investor Relations website at hrblock.com. Some of the figures that we'll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures in the schedules attached to our press release.\r\nBefore we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws. Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance.\r\nForward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially. You can learn more about these risks in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2014 and our other SEC filings. H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements.\r\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Colby, and good afternoon. I hope everybody had a great Labor Day weekend. Earlier today, we announced our first quarter results for fiscal year 2015, which ended July 31. As many of you know, our first quarter results are not indicative of our financial performance for the full year, given the seasonality of our business. As such, our prepared remarks will be relatively brief. I'll provide a few initial thoughts on the year ahead, and then Greg will take you through the details of our first quarter results.\r\nWe've been hard at work this summer, continuing to move forward with our planned Bank transaction with BofI and are refining our short- and long-range plans for the upcoming tax season and beyond. We are looking forward to the upcoming tax season as we continue to demonstrate our value and expertise through our Tax Plus strategy and as our clients begin to face complexities in their tax situations, resulting from the Affordable Care Act. \r\nWhile there's a lot of work to do, I'm confident that were poised to take advantage of the long-term opportunities that lie ahead. We had a strong year in 2014, and we're ready to carry that momentum into next year. We'll have much more to say about this during our investor conference in December. But today, I'd like to offer a few thoughts regarding H&R Block Bank, the upcoming tax season and our efforts regarding health care reform.\r\nFirst, let me provide a brief update on H&R Block Bank. As most of you know, in April, we announced an important step in our effort to exit the bank and cease being regulated as a savings and loan holding company. H&R Block Bank entered into a definitive purchase and assumption agreement to sell certain assets and liabilities to BofI Federal Bank. The parties also agreed to the terms of a program management agreement to form a long-term relationship in which BofI will offer core Financial Services products: the Emerald Advance line of credit; refund transfers; and our general-purpose reloadable debit card, the Emerald Card, to H&R Block clients. \r\nOur transaction with BofI remains subject to regulatory approval, and we continue to expect to complete this transaction in time for tax season 2015. I understand that many of you are interested in specific dates and time lines for the completion of this transaction. We'll issue a formal announcement once we've received all required decisions from the regulators regarding their review. If approved, we then expect it will take approximately 30 days following regulatory approval to close the transaction. As has been our practice, we'll continue to provide relevant updates when it is appropriate to do so. \r\nTurning to the next tax season. After returning to normal growth levels in 2014, we expect total IRS filings to continue to grow between 1% to 2% in 2015. We expect the assisted category to grow modestly and the digital category to outpace overall industry growth due to continued migration of those who previously filed using pen and paper and Earned Income Credit filers. We have taken an industry leadership position against tax fraud and continued to advocate for consistent standards in both assisted and DIY tax returns in all respects and, in particular, those that contain the Earned Income Credit. Until such parity standards are in place, we believe the industry will continue to see a shift in returns containing these credits from assisted to DIY. Aside from the EIC shift, we continue to expect the mix of assisted and do-it-yourself filers to be relatively consistent with prior seasons. \r\nOur primary goals in 2015 will be to continue executing on our Tax Plus strategy and growing our business profitably. We will also continue making investments to enhance our service offering and to update our offices and technology to ensure we are well-positioned to continue offering best-in-class service to our clients in the coming years. \r\nIn digital, we are entering the second year of a multiyear effort to enhance our product and drive improved market penetration, conversion and monetization. I'm confident that Jason Houseworth and his team will continue to execute on our strategy to simplify the user experience and to grow the business.\r\nFrom an operational perspective, we're in the midst of preparing our network for the changes resulting from the Affordable Care Act: updating our systems, training our people and finalizing our strategy for 2015. As most of you know, the IRS released many of the draft forms in late July, offering the industry its first glimpse of how the law will be implemented from a tax perspective. Additional worksheets and instructions are anticipated, which will enable us to gain a clearer understanding of how the ACA will impact tax returns. Thus, we won't cover too many details on today's call, but we'll highlight some key takeaways from the draft forms released in July. \r\nFirst, as expected, the forms are very detailed and can present significant complexity, depending on a filers' coverage status during the year, income levels and household composition. Depending on their situation, there are instances where filers may need to file multiple new tax forms and complete additional worksheets. \r\nSecond, while 1040EZ filers may not necessarily be the primary demographic impacted by the ACA, those that received an advanced tax credit will no longer be eligible to file their returns on a 1040EZ. \r\nThird, many filers who did not have qualified health insurance coverage for the full year will either face a tax penalty or will be eligible for an exemption. Depending on the type of exemption, the process to claim it could be quite cumbersome and time-consuming.\r\nFinally, for this coming tax season, those filers whose households are covered by qualified health insurance plans will be able to self-attest to their coverage status on their tax returns without the need to provide additional documentation. After analyzing the early drafts of these new forms, we continue to believe that health care reform will impact our clients and, in turn, present some opportunity for H&R Block to demonstrate our value. \r\nAs we said all along, however, it's going to take a few years for the opportunity presented by health care reform to develop. This is a long-term play, and we are making smart investments now to ensure we're prepared to serve our clients and meet their needs when they turn to us for help in understanding how the new law impacts them. We believe we've committed more resources to this initiative than anyone in the tax industry, and I'm confident we'll offer unmatched value as Americans seek assistance. We'll provide further details regarding our efforts during our investor conference in December.\r\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Greg to discuss the first quarter financial results.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everybody. Earlier today, we've reported our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. As a reminder, due to the seasonal nature of our business, these results are not indicative of our performance for the full year. \r\nAdjusted net loss from continuing operations was unchanged from the prior year quarter at $108 million or $0.40 per share. GAAP net loss per share from continuing operations was also $0.40 per share, representing a $0.02 improvement over the prior year.\r\nTurning to our segment results. Tax Services revenues increased $7 million to $129 million. This increase was driven by the extension of the Canadian tax season into May, which shifted revenues from fiscal 2014 into the first quarter of fiscal 2015. \r\nOn the expense side, the total operating expenses increased $14 million to $280 million. Higher depreciation and amortization from planned office and technology upgrades, increased wages and higher occupancy costs drove most of the increases in expenses. This was partially offset by lower foreign exchange currency losses and legal fees compared to prior year. The segment's pretax loss increased $6 million to $151 million. \r\nIn Corporate, revenues declined slightly due to lower interest income from H&R Block Bank's diminishing mortgage loan portfolio. Operating expenses declined $16 million, primarily due to lower provisions for losses on mortgage loans held for investment and lower expenses related to the pending sale of our bank. Accordingly, our pretax loss in Corporate improved $15 million to $25 million.\r\nTurning to discontinued operations, which includes results of Sand Canyon, our net loss of $7 million was $5 million higher than the prior year. Sand Canyon continues to engage in constructive settlement discussions with the counterparties from which it has received a significant majority of its asserted claims. Based on continued settlement discussions with these counterparties during the first quarter, Sand Canyon recorded a provision of $10 million for potential losses related to its representation and warranty obligations, bringing the total accrual at July 31 to $194 million. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is, and always has been, operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate veil-piercing argument. \r\nI'll now turn the call back to Bill for our closing remarks.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Greg. In conclusion, I am pleased with the progress we've made this off-season in preparation for tax season 2015. This year, we'll continue to focus on driving profitable growth and maximizing our value offering to our clients. There obviously remains much to do, but as we look ahead, I like our competitive position and believe that we have the right people, resources and expertise to continue to provide best-in-class service to our clients. We look forward to sharing additional plans with you at our investor conference on December 9 in New York.\r\nWith that, we're now ready for questions. Operator?",

I'll provide a few initial thoughts on the year ahead, and then Greg will take you through the details of our first quarter results.\r\nWe've been hard at work this summer, continuing to move forward with our planned Bank transaction with BofI and are refining our short- and long-range plans for the upcoming tax season and beyond. We are looking forward to the upcoming tax season as we continue to demonstrate our value and expertise through our Tax Plus strategy and as our clients begin to face complexities in their tax situations, resulting from the Affordable Care Act. \r\nWhile there's a lot of work to do, I'm confident that were poised to take advantage of the long-term opportunities that lie ahead. We had a strong year in 2014, and we're ready to carry that momentum into next year. We'll have much more to say about this during our investor conference in December. But today, I'd like to offer a few thoughts regarding H&R Block Bank, the upcoming tax season and our efforts regarding health care reform.\r\nFirst, let me provide a brief update on H&R Block Bank. As most of you know, in April, we announced an important step in our effort to exit the bank and cease being regulated as a savings and loan holding company. H&R Block Bank entered into a definitive purchase and assumption agreement to sell certain assets and liabilities to BofI Federal Bank. The parties also agreed to the terms of a program management agreement to form a long-term relationship in which BofI will offer core Financial Services products: the Emerald Advance line of credit; refund transfers; and our general-purpose reloadable debit card, the Emerald Card, to H&R Block clients. \r\nOur transaction with BofI remains subject to regulatory approval, and we continue to expect to complete this transaction in time for tax season 2015. I understand that many of you are interested in specific dates and time lines for the completion of this transaction. We'll issue a formal announcement once we've received all required decisions from the regulators regarding their review. If approved, we then expect it will take approximately 30 days following regulatory approval to close the transaction. As has been our practice, we'll continue to provide relevant updates when it is appropriate to do so. \r\nTurning to the next tax season. After returning to normal growth levels in 2014, we expect total IRS filings to continue to grow between 1% to 2% in 2015. We expect the assisted category to grow modestly and the digital category to outpace overall industry growth due to continued migration of those who previously filed using pen and paper and Earned Income Credit filers. We have taken an industry leadership position against tax fraud and continued to advocate for consistent standards in both assisted and DIY tax returns in all respects and, in particular, those that contain the Earned Income Credit. Until such parity standards are in place, we believe the industry will continue to see a shift in returns containing these credits from assisted to DIY. Aside from the EIC shift, we continue to expect the mix of assisted and do-it-yourself filers to be relatively consistent with prior seasons. \r\nOur primary goals in 2015 will be to continue executing on our Tax Plus strategy and growing our business profitably. We will also continue making investments to enhance our service offering and to update our offices and technology to ensure we are well-positioned to continue offering best-in-class service to our clients in the coming years. \r\nIn digital, we are entering the second year of a multiyear effort to enhance our product and drive improved market penetration, conversion and monetization. I'm confident that Jason Houseworth and his team will continue to execute on our strategy to simplify the user experience and to grow the business.\r\nFrom an operational perspective, we're in the midst of preparing our network for the changes resulting from the Affordable Care Act: updating our systems, training our people and finalizing our strategy for 2015. As most of you know, the IRS released many of the draft forms in late July, offering the industry its first glimpse of how the law will be implemented from a tax perspective. Additional worksheets and instructions are anticipated, which will enable us to gain a clearer understanding of how the ACA will impact tax returns. Thus, we won't cover too many details on today's call, but we'll highlight some key takeaways from the draft forms released in July. \r\nFirst, as expected, the forms are very detailed and can present significant complexity, depending on a filers' coverage status during the year, income levels and household composition. Depending on their situation, there are instances where filers may need to file multiple new tax forms and complete additional worksheets. \r\nSecond, while 1040EZ filers may not necessarily be the primary demographic impacted by the ACA, those that received an advanced tax credit will no longer be eligible to file their returns on a 1040EZ. \r\nThird, many filers who did not have qualified health insurance coverage for the full year will either face a tax penalty or will be eligible for an exemption. Depending on the type of exemption, the process to claim it could be quite cumbersome and time-consuming.\r\nFinally, for this coming tax season, those filers whose households are covered by qualified health insurance plans will be able to self-attest to their coverage status on their tax returns without the need to provide additional documentation. After analyzing the early drafts of these new forms, we continue to believe that health care reform will impact our clients and, in turn, present some opportunity for H&R Block to demonstrate our value. \r\nAs we said all along, however, it's going to take a few years for the opportunity presented by health care reform to develop. This is a long-term play, and we are making smart investments now to ensure we're prepared to serve our clients and meet their needs when they turn to us for help in understanding how the new law impacts them. We believe we've committed more resources to this initiative than anyone in the tax industry, and I'm confident we'll offer unmatched value as Americans seek assistance. We'll provide further details regarding our efforts during our investor conference in December.\r\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Greg to discuss the first quarter financial results.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nThanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everybody. Earlier today, we've reported our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. As a reminder, due to the seasonal nature of our business, these results are not indicative of our performance for the full year. \r\nAdjusted net loss from continuing operations was unchanged from the prior year quarter at $108 million or $0.40 per share. GAAP net loss per share from continuing operations was also $0.40 per share, representing a $0.02 improvement over the prior year.\r\nTurning to our segment results. Tax Services revenues increased $7 million to $129 million. This increase was driven by the extension of the Canadian tax season into May, which shifted revenues from fiscal 2014 into the first quarter of fiscal 2015. \r\nOn the expense side, the total operating expenses increased $14 million to $280 million. Higher depreciation and amortization from planned office and technology upgrades, increased wages and higher occupancy costs drove most of the increases in expenses. This was partially offset by lower foreign exchange currency losses and legal fees compared to prior year. The segment's pretax loss increased $6 million to $151 million. \r\nIn Corporate, revenues declined slightly due to lower interest income from H&R Block Bank's diminishing mortgage loan portfolio. Operating expenses declined $16 million, primarily due to lower provisions for losses on mortgage loans held for investment and lower expenses related to the pending sale of our bank. Accordingly, our pretax loss in Corporate improved $15 million to $25 million.\r\nTurning to discontinued operations, which includes results of Sand Canyon, our net loss of $7 million was $5 million higher than the prior year. Sand Canyon continues to engage in constructive settlement discussions with the counterparties from which it has received a significant majority of its asserted claims. Based on continued settlement discussions with these counterparties during the first quarter, Sand Canyon recorded a provision of $10 million for potential losses related to its representation and warranty obligations, bringing the total accrual at July 31 to $194 million. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is, and always has been, operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate veil-piercing argument. \r\nI'll now turn the call back to Bill for our closing remarks.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: William Cobb (Executives)】\nThanks, Greg. In conclusion, I am pleased with the progress we've made this off-season in preparation for tax season 2015. This year, we'll continue to focus on driving profitable growth and maximizing our value offering to our clients. There obviously remains much to do, but as we look ahead, I like our competitive position and believe that we have the right people, resources and expertise to continue to provide best-in-class service to our clients. We look forward to sharing additional plans with you at our investor conference on December 9 in New York.\r\nWith that, we're now ready for questions. Operator?",
      "transcript_text3": "Question on the digital side of the business. You lost market share in the most recent tax season. How important is it for you to maintain the momentum you had in the 2 previous seasons and continue to gain market share as you go into the next tax season?\n\n---\n\nYes. It was 3 previous tax seasons, and then last year, Turbo grew faster than we did on a unit basis, and we grew faster than they did on a revenue basis. So I think it is important. I do think we made some great strides last year in terms of our user experience. Jason and his team did some great things in terms of getting more people to upgrade to different levels of the product. So I'm not going to get into all the marketing details, but we remain committed to be a very strong #2 in this category, and we'll compete vigorously as we go forward into next year.\n\n---\n\nSo Bill, does that mean that if price competition continues to accelerate that you would also have to adjust your prices?\n\n---\n\nYes. I'm not going to get into any specifics at this point, Kartik, you know that. But we're certainly mindful of what Turbo did last year, and we'll be ready for this year.\n\n---\n\nGreg, can you just talk a little bit about the bank in terms of -- what does the drop-dead date have to be for you to get approval? If, for some reason, something happens and you're not able to get approval, what will be the contingency plan?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think it's important to start with really the broader point here, which is we really are targeting getting rid of our bank. That's job number one, and in conjunction with that is to do it in a seamless way from our clients' perspective and that continues to be our focus. We continue to believe that we'll get this done by tax season. The drop-dead date, I mean, that's kind of a very black-and-white term, but we believe we still have adequate time to get this thing done for this tax season.\n\n---\n\nNot to push you too hard on that last point, but if it takes 30 to 40 days to close a bank transaction, and you typically start the Emerald Advance product around Thanksgiving, does that mean that you're going to need to sell the bank around mid-October -- by -- or get regulatory approvals by around mid-October in order to have the bank either be at BofI or stay with you for EA? Or can you push it to kind of close to the actual tax season?\n\n---\n\nLet me answer, and then, Greg, if you want to add anything. Let's go back to what Greg's first point is. Job one is to exit the bank and cease being regulated as a savings and loan holding company. We still believe that we will be able to do that in time to have a seamless experience for our clients this tax season. I'm not going to get into specific dates, but obviously, we have talked to everybody about upon approval, assuming we get approval, which we believe we will, it will take about 30 days to close. So you can do the math, but what we continue to remain focused on is working closely with our regulators and with BofI. We have formed a great partnership with BofI. Our relationship with our regulators, they are completely professional. They're thorough. You all should be thankful of the job that they do, and I think we believe that this will still remain on the time line we've talked about previously.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you expect the assisted category to continue to grow modestly and digital category to outpace overall industry growth due to continued migration of pen and paper. But I think that some of us are hoping that there's going to be a shift from do-it-yourself to digital, just given the complexity of ACA. Does that -- do those comments kind of suggest otherwise?\n\n---\n\nI wouldn't read too much. I mean, I think what we're talking about overall is we believe that the category, we believe, is normalized now, and the 1% to 2% overall growth is correct. I think we've been pretty consistent on saying that until we get -- we still haven't gotten into a tax season where the Affordable Care Act has had an impact. It's going to take a few years to see how that all shakes out so that's why we're cautious on trying to predict any increase in the number of tax rate. We just have to see how this plays out. I do think what's important for us is to have our tax pros ready, have them trained, to have our office standards up high, and we're ready to certainly serve clients as they phase into, what we believe, to your premise, Thomas, is correct that this is going to be much more complex. I'm sure a number of you have looked at the forms, and we do believe that people are going to need help in filling out these forms. But again, until it plays out, we're not going to get ahead of ourselves on this.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just finally, I saw in the quarter you announced the partnership with BMRG and that you've been expanding your small business footprint. You did that deal with zero too.. How big of an opportunity is this? And if you can elaborate on that at all, that would be really helpful.\n\n---\n\nYes. Again, I want to be transparent but also say this is a pilot for us. We're actually very excited about some of the steps we've taken. We've been in business services in a relatively small way for many years. We have a few thousand offices who offer business services, and this is an attempt for us to have a best-in-class service for small business. We will be piloting it this year, so I would say stay tuned. But it is certainly something that we want to see if we can get a best-in-class offering and see what that does for us.\n\n---\n\nYou now that you've had a chance to look at the new forms, sounds like you've done analysis. You showed great analysis with us last Analyst Day about how many people you expect to be in some of these categories. What's your updated view over how many people are going to need -- what proportion of overall customer base and then your customer base is going to need to fill out any number of these new forms?\n\n---\n\nYes. We don't have an update today, Gil. I think what we're planning on is updating as we get the full worksheets, the -- all the rules, et cetera. We're planning on doing that in December at the Investor Day. We -- as I think when we were traveling with you, I said we probably aren't going to do as much disclosure as you'd like. But we will -- I think we'll be similar. We're planning on Mark Ciaramitero presenting again, and I think we'll give you an update at that point. We really want to get the full offering, if you will, from the IRS. We're working through how that matches up. There's not a lot of data at this point. We know 8 million people enrolled, but we still have -- and there are things coming out all the time. So I think we can give you a much better feel for that in December.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then in terms of the health insurance product, are you going to try to do a few more pilots this year in your physical stores now that we're in year 2 and hopefully, the systems or the government systems are working a little bit better? Or are you going to stick with the online distribution for this next tax season?\n\n---\n\nWe're going to stick with the online distribution. We like the relationship we have with GoHealth. We think the user experience is excellent. The Phoenix pilot, we are not going to continue with. Many of the clients who came in were more Medicaid clients and didn't -- weren't able to sign up on the exchanges. So I think we're going to focus on -- we think that, that experience is actually the best for our clients, and so for this tax season, that's what we're going to focus on.\n\n---\n\nAnd I just want to make it clear. I know, Gil, that you understand this. But we said the online experience -- I mean, what we're doing is using the in-store experience as a way to have a discussion with our clients about their health care needs. If there is an identified need, then we would then basically forward them on, encourage them to go contact GoHealth either through a phone number or through the online experience. But if you went into a store, you'd see in-store merchandise and you'd see signage of the actual tax software that sits there in front of the client. There is information available to them and, of course, the tax professionals will be able to talk about it in a meaningful way. They're, of course, not licensed or appointed so they can't \"sell insurance,\" but certainly, we're going to use that as an opportunity to encourage the client to move over to GoHealth opportunity.\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, ultimately, we have an enrollment service, which is the GoHealth opportunity. We will be engaging with millions of clients, obviously, on the tax implications in doing their 2014 tax returns and what the Affordable Care Act has brought.\n\n---\n\nThen finally, on Tax Plus, Emerald Card, how do you feel about the kind of post-tax season performance in terms of the reloads in the number of cards outstanding? And where is that headed over into next tax season?\n\n---\n\nWe continue to think to have a good story. We showed you good progress on the year-round usage for the last 2 years. I mean, we've gone roughly from $35 a card. We're into the mid-40s now. So that's $10 per card over a 2-year period. We haven't given specific numbers over the summer at this point. You'll probably see some more information on that at our December conference. But I would say, in general, that we still feel very good about what the bank team and our broader marketing team is doing in and around that area.\n\n---\n\nFollowing up on the partnership with GoHealth, and it sounds like you're going the online route versus the pilot you did in Arizona. Greg, how should we think about that being accretive or dilutive? You gave some guidance on that last year on what that initial pilot was, the whole shebang. So could you just give us a little feel for a little less so now that you're out of locations with humans or maybe a little bit more spend online?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, I think it's important that we're interested in this area. We think there's value for our clients, and we think we got relevancy here. The fundamental issue from a forecasting perspective is last season was so unusual with the delays with the government. It was hard for us to use that information and to extrapolate, but we're prepared to put resources behind the GoHealth this year. GoHealth is a good partner. As Bill mentioned earlier, this was going to unfold just like the broader health care opportunity. But we are interested in it that's why we're talking about it.\n\n---\n\nThe -- obviously, you mentioned the way July -- the update on the form, and we'll obviously get an update at Investor Day. I think the one question folks are looking to get and you probably don't have the answer, but I'm asking anyway, is how much incremental change do you anticipate coming to the forms? Or do you think you have -- you think this is largely what you're going to look like entering the season barring anything dramatic?\n\n---\n\nI think we have a majority of the information would be my guess. But I don't want to speak for the IRS in terms of the complete array, if you will, Scott. And that's why we're being a little cautious in terms of going forward. We're not making any pronouncements about monetization or how that's going to impact our interview. Obviously, the forms are more complex. There are a number of avenues that you can take because given that the law of the land now is to have health insurance. If you have it, that's one path. If you have it through the exchange, that's another path. If you don't have it, that's another path. To pay a penalty or get an exemption. So we're working through all of that. And like I said, we plan to hopefully give you a more -- much more complete picture as we have what we believe will be all the information by the time we meet with you in December.\n\n---\n\nThe one specific area I would say that we are still very curious about is the penalty process and how that's going to be actually handled as it relates directly to the tax events, and that's really the main open question that's available to us.\n\n---\n\nThen curious to get your take on -- we've now gone 2 years where instead of mid-January start, we've had a late-January start. Do you think that's going to be the new norm and reasons why or why not? And then just any thoughts on, whatever your answer is, on how we may think about modeling third and fourth quarter?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think -- I don't think we know at this point. I think the plan is the IRS, some time in the fall, will give us an indication of when e-file will open. Obviously, the last 2 years, there were some mitigating circumstances around the fiscal cliff and then the government shutdown. Whether or not anything comes out of -- this is an election year. There will be a lame-duck session. But I think we may know before that. So I think the IRS is working closely, but we have not gotten any official word on that at this point.\n\n---\n\nAnd just a couple of more quick ones. The -- I noticed in the release with regard to the elevated expense in this seasonally soft quarter year-over-year, just curious if, Greg, you could address higher wages, higher occupancy costs and then offset by the legal fees part? Is everything going as planned at this point in the year? Should we think of anything more or less with regard to spend on modernization of stores or anything else to think about?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, there are a lot of moving pieces in the expense line. I think, normally, our 1Q and 2Q, we did spend more time talking to you all about our expense plan. But we're going to do, though, is really, in December, give you better kind of idea what we think margins are going to be. We continue to articulate the 27% to 32% range, 31% last year EBITDA margins and 30% [ph] the year before, just for those of you keeping track. We did see expenses up in the first quarter. Part of that was timing. We referred to the revenue shift in Canada because of the delay there, past the April 30 cutoff for their fiscal -- for their tax year '14. That also had some expenses that moved from the fourth quarter to first quarter. We had some wages increased, which is really some additional headcount that we've added to the system really around some of these growth initiatives, some things we talked to you all about before. Other than that, we saw a lot of timing things. Of course, D&A was up because CapEx had been up the last couple of years. It's more just math. We've seen some of the rent costs go up a little bit, and I think that's mostly a function of just inflation combined with -- we're probably going to have gotten through our shrinkage period with Walmart and Sears, and we're more stable that maybe adding a slightly [ph] number of new stores. So a lot of moving pieces, but that's kind of the highlights for you.\n\n---\n\nAnd then lastly, the tolling agreements, this is the, I think, second quarter in a row where there's an increase to the loan loss reserve. So clearly, you have a lot of discourse occurring. I know you probably can't share too much. But I guess, Greg, you're the right guy to ask. What -- with 2 quarters in a row, how should we think about that? Is there anything dramatic going on? Is the end near?\n\n---\n\nWell, I mean, my kind of point of view on this -- I mean, the people behind us is really Sand Canyon, right? So I'll just give you my point of view. I mean, I have infrequent, regular kind of communications with them. I see the positive the tolling arrangements that Sand Canyon entered into are almost exclusively short term in nature, and that's measured in a couple of months usually. The fact Sand Canyon and its Board of Directors feel there's value and, therefore, renews them is a good sign. In my view, if they thought it was a waste of time, then why would they renew them would be my kind of thinking. And the fact that there is -- and again, my perspective a small amount of change the reserve, in the grand scheme of things, is pretty small. To me, it suggests they're probably getting closer to some resolution, but time will tell. These things take longer than we always want them to. So in my mind, it's always been a positive step forward.\n\n---\n\nFrom a complexity perspective in the draft forms that are available, it seems that 8962 is a lot more complex than the 8965. If there are minimal changes from this juncture, do you foresee a pricing opportunity on both of these forms? If you could just help us think about that, I'd appreciate it.\n\n---\n\nYes. Thanks, Anj. The -- again, I'm going to frustrate everybody by saying we are looking closely at all of this. We want to make sure that we look at this question as opposed to form by form what could we price this at. We're looking at it in a totality of the entire tax return and what might be -- what might the best use cases on life situation be in conjunction with these forms. So it's a little more complex than just saying, yes, 8962, we can get x amount for that. So that work is under way. And as I said, it's a combination of what we know now in trying to model that out and then knowing that there may be additional information. So again, I think that what we'll -- what you'll see in December is more clarity from us. I doubt we're going to give you a pricing schedule but -- and I haven't -- we haven't gotten to that level of specificity because I don't think, for competitive reasons, we should do that. But I do think we're going to give you a better feel for how we see this whole thing unfolding. And again, I -- Greg and I are not trying to just kick everything to December, but it actually is a really good time for us. Our plans are done. Our conventions are done with our company operations and our franchisees. We're very close to tax season. So it really does work well in terms of being able to disclose to our investors where we see the tax season unfolding.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's helpful and one more for me. On the digital side, what is your thinking on retention of your current mix of customers if, let's say, Intuit was to be aggressive on price again? And if you can share any changes or investments in the product experience for the 2015 tax season.\n\n---\n\nYes. I think Jason laid out last year at Investor Day a 2-year plan in terms of a user experience and an upgrading the product. That is on pace. You will see further enhancements here. I'm very excited about the work that he and his team have done. So you'll certainly see an enhanced product with regard to pricing. Again, like I told Kartik, I'm not going to comment specifically on that. But obviously, we've done a lot of analysis on last tax season, and we're formulating our plans as we speak for next year.\n\n---\n\nFollowing up on some of the things, in terms of return count for both of you and the IRS, it would seem 1% to 2% is below where employment was this year. And if you take into account something up a percent from ACA, the industry would grow faster than [indiscernible]. And I would think that Block, considering last year, cut some returns for profitability reasons, the number should be better. Would you like to comment on that?\n\n---\n\nYes. Maybe Mike, and thank you for the question. So the guidance that we gave a little bit earlier, that outline is really -- think of it as a normal expectation based on employment and some other factors we have in our model. We, from an ACA perspective, didn't really take a position on that forecast.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And in terms of pricing, excluding now the ACA pricing, last year, your prices were up at least partly because you reduced low-priced products. Should we think about this year's revenue per return as being greater than that? Liberty [indiscernible] talks about 5%. Can you comment as to anything that might help us think about your revenue return thinking?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, the revenue per return is also a function of mix. It's not just a function of price, but I'll just isolate price for you. We will tell you as an industry that we have pricing power on the assisted side. We know what the elasticity curves look like quite well. We have pricing power in the DIY business. It's not quite as strong, but I'll focus really on the retail side. We, at Block in the last 10 years, have increased our pricing, all things being equal other than price, a little bit greater than the rate of inflation. So that's kind of our expression of pricing power. Last year, we did a lot of cleanup things, more discount controls, eliminated some promotional campaigns like the free EZ. That had a price impact, but it's not in the traditional way of pricing. In terms of the go-forward look around ACA, as Bill has mentioned before, we're not prepared to talk about that at this point.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And third, maybe last, can you talk about whether you believe that ACAs can result in any refund delays this year -- this tax season?\n\n---\n\nI don't know, Mike. It's a good question in terms of how we anticipate things playing out. I do think the IRS, given that this is the first year, I don't think I'd mess around with the -- I wouldn't underestimate the IRS. I wouldn't mess around with trying to see if you can beat the system because I think they're going to be very keen to make sure that people are answering their -- answering and putting the forms together the right way. I think they'll be very attuned to this area. Will that delay refunds? Again, I think if you take some liberties, you're going to be in special processing, and nobody wants to go there. So I don't know. Again, I want to see -- we got to see how this plays out. This is the first year of that. There'll be some shakeout. But it's an interesting observation, and we'll just have to see how it plays out.\n\n---\n\nThank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes today's call.",

If, for some reason, something happens and you're not able to get approval, what will be the contingency plan?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nWell, I think it's important to start with really the broader point here, which is we really are targeting getting rid of our bank. That's job number one, and in conjunction with that is to do it in a seamless way from our clients' perspective and that continues to be our focus. We continue to believe that we'll get this done by tax season. The drop-dead date, I mean, that's kind of a very black-and-white term, but we believe we still have adequate time to get this thing done for this tax season.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nNot to push you too hard on that last point, but if it takes 30 to 40 days to close a bank transaction, and you typically start the Emerald Advance product around Thanksgiving, does that mean that you're going to need to sell the bank around mid-October -- by -- or get regulatory approvals by around mid-October in order to have the bank either be at BofI or stay with you for EA? Or can you push it to kind of close to the actual tax season?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nLet me answer, and then, Greg, if you want to add anything. Let's go back to what Greg's first point is. Job one is to exit the bank and cease being regulated as a savings and loan holding company. We still believe that we will be able to do that in time to have a seamless experience for our clients this tax season. I'm not going to get into specific dates, but obviously, we have talked to everybody about upon approval, assuming we get approval, which we believe we will, it will take about 30 days to close. So you can do the math, but what we continue to remain focused on is working closely with our regulators and with BofI. We have formed a great partnership with BofI. Our relationship with our regulators, they are completely professional. They're thorough. You all should be thankful of the job that they do, and I think we believe that this will still remain on the time line we've talked about previously.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you expect the assisted category to continue to grow modestly and digital category to outpace overall industry growth due to continued migration of pen and paper. But I think that some of us are hoping that there's going to be a shift from do-it-yourself to digital, just given the complexity of ACA. Does that -- do those comments kind of suggest otherwise?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nI wouldn't read too much. I mean, I think what we're talking about overall is we believe that the category, we believe, is normalized now, and the 1% to 2% overall growth is correct. I think we've been pretty consistent on saying that until we get -- we still haven't gotten into a tax season where the Affordable Care Act has had an impact. It's going to take a few years to see how that all shakes out so that's why we're cautious on trying to predict any increase in the number of tax rate. We just have to see how this plays out. I do think what's important for us is to have our tax pros ready, have them trained, to have our office standards up high, and we're ready to certainly serve clients as they phase into, what we believe, to your premise, Thomas, is correct that this is going to be much more complex. I'm sure a number of you have looked at the forms, and we do believe that people are going to need help in filling out these forms. But again, until it plays out, we're not going to get ahead of ourselves on this.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just finally, I saw in the quarter you announced the partnership with BMRG and that you've been expanding your small business footprint. You did that deal with zero too.. How big of an opportunity is this? And if you can elaborate on that at all, that would be really helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes. Again, I want to be transparent but also say this is a pilot for us. We're actually very excited about some of the steps we've taken. We've been in business services in a relatively small way for many years. We have a few thousand offices who offer business services, and this is an attempt for us to have a best-in-class service for small business. We will be piloting it this year, so I would say stay tuned. But it is certainly something that we want to see if we can get a best-in-class offering and see what that does for us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gil Luria (Analysts)】\nYou now that you've had a chance to look at the new forms, sounds like you've done analysis. You showed great analysis with us last Analyst Day about how many people you expect to be in some of these categories. What's your updated view over how many people are going to need -- what proportion of overall customer base and then your customer base is going to need to fill out any number of these new forms?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes. We don't have an update today, Gil. I think what we're planning on is updating as we get the full worksheets, the -- all the rules, et cetera. We're planning on doing that in December at the Investor Day. We -- as I think when we were traveling with you, I said we probably aren't going to do as much disclosure as you'd like. But we will -- I think we'll be similar. We're planning on Mark Ciaramitero presenting again, and I think we'll give you an update at that point. We really want to get the full offering, if you will, from the IRS. We're working through how that matches up. There's not a lot of data at this point. We know 8 million people enrolled, but we still have -- and there are things coming out all the time. So I think we can give you a much better feel for that in December.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gil Luria (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then in terms of the health insurance product, are you going to try to do a few more pilots this year in your physical stores now that we're in year 2 and hopefully, the systems or the government systems are working a little bit better? Or are you going to stick with the online distribution for this next tax season?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nWe're going to stick with the online distribution. We like the relationship we have with GoHealth. We think the user experience is excellent. The Phoenix pilot, we are not going to continue with. Many of the clients who came in were more Medicaid clients and didn't -- weren't able to sign up on the exchanges. So I think we're going to focus on -- we think that, that experience is actually the best for our clients, and so for this tax season, that's what we're going to focus on.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nAnd I just want to make it clear. I know, Gil, that you understand this. But we said the online experience -- I mean, what we're doing is using the in-store experience as a way to have a discussion with our clients about their health care needs. If there is an identified need, then we would then basically forward them on, encourage them to go contact GoHealth either through a phone number or through the online experience. But if you went into a store, you'd see in-store merchandise and you'd see signage of the actual tax software that sits there in front of the client. There is information available to them and, of course, the tax professionals will be able to talk about it in a meaningful way. They're, of course, not licensed or appointed so they can't \"sell insurance,\" but certainly, we're going to use that as an opportunity to encourage the client to move over to GoHealth opportunity.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, ultimately, we have an enrollment service, which is the GoHealth opportunity. We will be engaging with millions of clients, obviously, on the tax implications in doing their 2014 tax returns and what the Affordable Care Act has brought.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gil Luria (Analysts)】\nThen finally, on Tax Plus, Emerald Card, how do you feel about the kind of post-tax season performance in terms of the reloads in the number of cards outstanding? And where is that headed over into next tax season?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nWe continue to think to have a good story. We showed you good progress on the year-round usage for the last 2 years. I mean, we've gone roughly from $35 a card. We're into the mid-40s now. So that's $10 per card over a 2-year period. We haven't given specific numbers over the summer at this point. You'll probably see some more information on that at our December conference. But I would say, in general, that we still feel very good about what the bank team and our broader marketing team is doing in and around that area.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nFollowing up on the partnership with GoHealth, and it sounds like you're going the online route versus the pilot you did in Arizona. Greg, how should we think about that being accretive or dilutive? You gave some guidance on that last year on what that initial pilot was, the whole shebang. So could you just give us a little feel for a little less so now that you're out of locations with humans or maybe a little bit more spend online?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, I think it's important that we're interested in this area. We think there's value for our clients, and we think we got relevancy here. The fundamental issue from a forecasting perspective is last season was so unusual with the delays with the government. It was hard for us to use that information and to extrapolate, but we're prepared to put resources behind the GoHealth this year. GoHealth is a good partner. As Bill mentioned earlier, this was going to unfold just like the broader health care opportunity. But we are interested in it that's why we're talking about it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nThe -- obviously, you mentioned the way July -- the update on the form, and we'll obviously get an update at Investor Day. I think the one question folks are looking to get and you probably don't have the answer, but I'm asking anyway, is how much incremental change do you anticipate coming to the forms? Or do you think you have -- you think this is largely what you're going to look like entering the season barring anything dramatic?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nI think we have a majority of the information would be my guess. But I don't want to speak for the IRS in terms of the complete array, if you will, Scott. And that's why we're being a little cautious in terms of going forward. We're not making any pronouncements about monetization or how that's going to impact our interview. Obviously, the forms are more complex. There are a number of avenues that you can take because given that the law of the land now is to have health insurance. If you have it, that's one path. If you have it through the exchange, that's another path. If you don't have it, that's another path. To pay a penalty or get an exemption. So we're working through all of that. And like I said, we plan to hopefully give you a more -- much more complete picture as we have what we believe will be all the information by the time we meet with you in December.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nThe one specific area I would say that we are still very curious about is the penalty process and how that's going to be actually handled as it relates directly to the tax events, and that's really the main open question that's available to us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nThen curious to get your take on -- we've now gone 2 years where instead of mid-January start, we've had a late-January start. Do you think that's going to be the new norm and reasons why or why not? And then just any thoughts on, whatever your answer is, on how we may think about modeling third and fourth quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes. I think -- I don't think we know at this point. I think the plan is the IRS, some time in the fall, will give us an indication of when e-file will open. Obviously, the last 2 years, there were some mitigating circumstances around the fiscal cliff and then the government shutdown. Whether or not anything comes out of -- this is an election year. There will be a lame-duck session. But I think we may know before that. So I think the IRS is working closely, but we have not gotten any official word on that at this point.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nAnd just a couple of more quick ones. The -- I noticed in the release with regard to the elevated expense in this seasonally soft quarter year-over-year, just curious if, Greg, you could address higher wages, higher occupancy costs and then offset by the legal fees part? Is everything going as planned at this point in the year? Should we think of anything more or less with regard to spend on modernization of stores or anything else to think about?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, there are a lot of moving pieces in the expense line. I think, normally, our 1Q and 2Q, we did spend more time talking to you all about our expense plan. But we're going to do, though, is really, in December, give you better kind of idea what we think margins are going to be. We continue to articulate the 27% to 32% range, 31% last year EBITDA margins and 30% [ph] the year before, just for those of you keeping track. We did see expenses up in the first quarter. Part of that was timing. We referred to the revenue shift in Canada because of the delay there, past the April 30 cutoff for their fiscal -- for their tax year '14. That also had some expenses that moved from the fourth quarter to first quarter. We had some wages increased, which is really some additional headcount that we've added to the system really around some of these growth initiatives, some things we talked to you all about before. Other than that, we saw a lot of timing things. Of course, D&A was up because CapEx had been up the last couple of years. It's more just math. We've seen some of the rent costs go up a little bit, and I think that's mostly a function of just inflation combined with -- we're probably going to have gotten through our shrinkage period with Walmart and Sears, and we're more stable that maybe adding a slightly [ph] number of new stores. So a lot of moving pieces, but that's kind of the highlights for you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nAnd then lastly, the tolling agreements, this is the, I think, second quarter in a row where there's an increase to the loan loss reserve. So clearly, you have a lot of discourse occurring. I know you probably can't share too much. But I guess, Greg, you're the right guy to ask. What -- with 2 quarters in a row, how should we think about that? Is there anything dramatic going on? Is the end near?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nWell, I mean, my kind of point of view on this -- I mean, the people behind us is really Sand Canyon, right? So I'll just give you my point of view. I mean, I have infrequent, regular kind of communications with them. I see the positive the tolling arrangements that Sand Canyon entered into are almost exclusively short term in nature, and that's measured in a couple of months usually. The fact Sand Canyon and its Board of Directors feel there's value and, therefore, renews them is a good sign. In my view, if they thought it was a waste of time, then why would they renew them would be my kind of thinking. And the fact that there is -- and again, my perspective a small amount of change the reserve, in the grand scheme of things, is pretty small. To me, it suggests they're probably getting closer to some resolution, but time will tell. These things take longer than we always want them to. So in my mind, it's always been a positive step forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anjaneya Singh (Analysts)】\nFrom a complexity perspective in the draft forms that are available, it seems that 8962 is a lot more complex than the 8965. If there are minimal changes from this juncture, do you foresee a pricing opportunity on both of these forms? If you could just help us think about that, I'd appreciate it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes. Thanks, Anj. The -- again, I'm going to frustrate everybody by saying we are looking closely at all of this. We want to make sure that we look at this question as opposed to form by form what could we price this at. We're looking at it in a totality of the entire tax return and what might be -- what might the best use cases on life situation be in conjunction with these forms. So it's a little more complex than just saying, yes, 8962, we can get x amount for that. So that work is under way. And as I said, it's a combination of what we know now in trying to model that out and then knowing that there may be additional information. So again, I think that what we'll -- what you'll see in December is more clarity from us. I doubt we're going to give you a pricing schedule but -- and I haven't -- we haven't gotten to that level of specificity because I don't think, for competitive reasons, we should do that. But I do think we're going to give you a better feel for how we see this whole thing unfolding. And again, I -- Greg and I are not trying to just kick everything to December, but it actually is a really good time for us. Our plans are done. Our conventions are done with our company operations and our franchisees. We're very close to tax season. So it really does work well in terms of being able to disclose to our investors where we see the tax season unfolding.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anjaneya Singh (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's helpful and one more for me. On the digital side, what is your thinking on retention of your current mix of customers if, let's say, Intuit was to be aggressive on price again? And if you can share any changes or investments in the product experience for the 2015 tax season.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes. I think Jason laid out last year at Investor Day a 2-year plan in terms of a user experience and an upgrading the product. That is on pace. You will see further enhancements here. I'm very excited about the work that he and his team have done. So you'll certainly see an enhanced product with regard to pricing. Again, like I told Kartik, I'm not going to comment specifically on that. But obviously, we've done a lot of analysis on last tax season, and we're formulating our plans as we speak for next year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nFollowing up on some of the things, in terms of return count for both of you and the IRS, it would seem 1% to 2% is below where employment was this year. And if you take into account something up a percent from ACA, the industry would grow faster than [indiscernible]. And I would think that Block, considering last year, cut some returns for profitability reasons, the number should be better. Would you like to comment on that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes. Maybe Mike, and thank you for the question. So the guidance that we gave a little bit earlier, that outline is really -- think of it as a normal expectation based on employment and some other factors we have in our model. We, from an ACA perspective, didn't really take a position on that forecast.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nOkay. And in terms of pricing, excluding now the ACA pricing, last year, your prices were up at least partly because you reduced low-priced products. Should we think about this year's revenue per return as being greater than that? Liberty [indiscernible] talks about 5%. Can you comment as to anything that might help us think about your revenue return thinking?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, the revenue per return is also a function of mix. It's not just a function of price, but I'll just isolate price for you. We will tell you as an industry that we have pricing power on the assisted side. We know what the elasticity curves look like quite well. We have pricing power in the DIY business. It's not quite as strong, but I'll focus really on the retail side. We, at Block in the last 10 years, have increased our pricing, all things being equal other than price, a little bit greater than the rate of inflation. So that's kind of our expression of pricing power. Last year, we did a lot of cleanup things, more discount controls, eliminated some promotional campaigns like the free EZ. That had a price impact, but it's not in the traditional way of pricing. In terms of the go-forward look around ACA, as Bill has mentioned before, we're not prepared to talk about that at this point.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nOkay. And third, maybe last, can you talk about whether you believe that ACAs can result in any refund delays this year -- this tax season?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nI don't know, Mike. It's a good question in terms of how we anticipate things playing out. I do think the IRS, given that this is the first year, I don't think I'd mess around with the -- I wouldn't underestimate the IRS. I wouldn't mess around with trying to see if you can beat the system because I think they're going to be very keen to make sure that people are answering their -- answering and putting the forms together the right way. I think they'll be very attuned to this area. Will that delay refunds? Again, I think if you take some liberties, you're going to be in special processing, and nobody wants to go there. So I don't know. Again, I want to see -- we got to see how this plays out. This is the first year of that. There'll be some shakeout. But it's an interesting observation, and we'll just have to see how it plays out.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nThank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes today's call.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Call and Webcast for Campbell Soup Company. With me here in New Jersey today are: Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Anthony DiSilvestro, our Chief Financial Officer; and Anna Choi, Senior Manager of Investor Relations. \r\nI'm going to start things off with a few reminders, including items impacting comparability and our quarterly earnings dates for fiscal 2015. Denise will follow with her perspective on the quarter and the year and our plans for fiscal 2015. Anthony will then discuss our financial results for the quarter and full year, finishing with our expectations for fiscal 2015. And after that, we'll take your questions. As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You'll find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com and on our IR app, which is available through Google or Apple. Please keep in mind that our call is open to members of the media, who are participating in listen-only mode. \r\nToday's presentation includes forward-looking statements, which reflect Campbell's current expectations about future plans and performance. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to inherent risks. Please refer to Slide 3 in the presentation or to Campbell's most recent 10-K and SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statement. \r\nNow I'd like to remind you about items impacting comparability. As we said in this morning's news release, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded $21 million of pretax restructuring charges and restructuring-related costs to improve our supply chain efficiency in Australia, to reduce overhead across the organization and for previously announced initiatives. We also recorded an additional $4 million pretax settlement charge associated with the U.S. pension plan. Last year in the fourth quarter, we recorded $30 million of pretax restructuring charges and restructuring-related costs to improve our U.S. supply chain infrastructure, to expand access to manufacturing and distribution capabilities in Mexico, to improve the Pepperidge Farm supply chain and to reduce overhead in North America. Our comparisons in fiscal 2014 with fiscal 2013 will exclude previously announced items as shown on Slide 4. \r\nSo now let me remind you that we will use non-GAAP measures to enhance our explanations. We provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure as an appendix to the slides accompanying our presentation. Because our guidance for fiscal 2015 is on 52 weeks versus 52 weeks, we show the estimated impact of the extra week in fiscal 2014 on sales and earnings as well. These slides, along with our earnings release and selected quarterly and annual financials, also can be found on our website, which is available online or on your mobile device with the Campbell IR app. \r\nLast, please mark your calendars for our planned fiscal 2015 earnings dates, shown on Slide 6. Like this quarter, the dates are a little later than usual due to the 53rd week, which you'll be hearing about a lot on this call. November 25 is when we plan to report first quarter earnings. The next 3 earnings dates are February 25 of 2015, May 22 of 2015 and September 4 of 2015. \r\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Denise.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Jennifer, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. At our Investor Day in July, I told you that I remain confident that our strategy to reshape Campbell by strengthening our core business and expanding into faster-growing spaces is the right course for our company.  But I also know that it will take more time than we originally anticipated to achieve our long-term growth targets. Our industry is now in a period of profound change and challenge, and there has been a meaningful decline in the performance of the packaged foods sector. Forces like the economic environment, the transformation of consumers' food preferences with regard to health and wellness and their demand for greater transparency, the powerful social and demographic changes and the rise of e-commerce are all driving significant changes in consumer behavior with respect to food. \r\nWith this as background, today, I will focus most of my remarks on our performance for full year 2014 and our expectations for fiscal 2015. But first, I will briefly comment on our fourth quarter results. Our fourth quarter results benefited from the extra week in the fiscal year, which was the significant driver in the quarter, as we delivered 7% sales growth and double-digit growth in adjusted EBIT and EPS. Organic sales in the quarter decreased 2% as our core business continued to underperform in a challenging consumer environment. \r\nTurning to our full year results in 2014. Including the 53rd week and the benefit of acquisitions, Campbell delivered growth in both sales and adjusted earnings. We were encouraged by the performance of the businesses we acquired in the last 2 fiscal years as part of our strategy to reshape Campbell's growth trajectory. But we were not satisfied with the performance of our core business. And our organic sales results for the year reflected the extremely difficult market conditions, which are impacting the food business. \r\nConsistent with our most recent guidance, sales from continuing operations increased 3% to nearly $8.3 billion, benefiting from acquisitions and an extra week in the fiscal year. Organic sales declined 1%. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes from continuing operations grew 4% to nearly $1.3 billion, and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 2% to $2.53. \r\nIn U.S. Simple Meals, we delivered growth in sauces with higher sales of Prego pasta sauces and Campbell's dinner sauces. But after growing 5% in fiscal 2013, sales declined in U.S. Soup, as organic growth in Swanson Broth, which increased 8%, was more than offset by declines in ready-to-serve and condensed soups amid softer consumption. In Global Baking and Snacking, the acquisition of Kelsen Group contributed $193 million in sales. We had modest growth in Pepperidge Farm, including continued gains in our Goldfish franchise and fresh bakery. We had solid growth in Indonesia. As we expected, sales declined in our business in Australia. As we outlined at our Investor Day in July, we have initiated turnaround plans to reinvigorate both our Australian business and our U.S. Beverages business, which also declined for the year. \r\nOverall, we are embracing change and continuing to diversify our portfolio. We are building our presence in packaged fresh and other faster-growing spaces, in strategically important geographies outside of our developed markets and in channels that will make our products available everywhere consumers shop. In fiscal 2014, we achieved some key milestones in the execution of these strategies. \r\nWe completed our acquisition of Kelsen Group, which has given us a valuable growth platform, with 40% of its sales of baked snacks in China and Hong Kong. We invested in our first marketing programs to build the Bolthouse Farms brand and expanded the distribution of Bolthouse products, driving solid sales growth and share gains of super premium beverages in measured channels. Internationally, we divested our slow-growing European Simple Meals business to focus on growth opportunities in Asia and Latin America and expanded our sweet biscuit business in Indonesia, a key developing market. In January, we transitioned to a new U.S. network of distributors for our single-serve beverages. Over time, we expect this network to drive immediate consumption growth for both our V8 and Bolthouse Farms brands. We increased our digital and e-commerce capabilities to enhance our connection with consumers, who are engaging with brands in new ways. We continue to drive consumer-focused innovation, with new products equaling 11% of list sales on a rolling 3 basis.  Across our portfolio, we reduced overhead cost, which is critical to funding our growth. Finally, we reflected on our company's purpose, which we've expressed in 7 words: Real food that matters for life's moments. This will be the compass that guides our decisions as we aspire to become a $10 billion company within the next 5 years. It affirms our connections to the core values that have inspired trust in Campbell in the past and it bridges us to the priorities of new generations. \r\nNow that 2014 is behind us, I want to give you a brief overview of our plans for fiscal 2015. We will take further action to drive growth in our important U.S. Soup portfolio and improve category performance. To do this, we will continue to elevate quality, increase our brand-building and drive more innovation, including our first Campbell's organic soups. We intend to expand in the premium soup segment, strengthen ready-to-serve soups and grow our #1 position in condensed soups and broth. We will drive growth in Pepperidge Farm by executing against all the drivers of demand, including increased innovation, particularly in the back half of the year. We will revitalize our shelf-stable U.S. Beverage business by leveraging innovation and the powerful equities of the V8 brand in vegetable nutrition to capitalize on the juicing trend with affordable juicing. We will continue to stabilize our Australian business and rejuvenate sales of Arnott's biscuits in that key market. In faster-growing spaces, our acquisitions of Bolthouse Farms, Plum and Kelsen have diversified our nearly $8.3 billion portfolio as we continue to shift our center of gravity. We expect all 3 of these businesses to grow the top line as we expand distribution. \r\nTo continue to drive our expansion into faster-growing spaces, we will focus on 4 key platforms under our long-term strategy. Number one, accelerating breakthrough innovation, including continued expansion in Campbell's dinner sauces and plans this year to extend the V8 brand into adult on-the-go nutrition with protein bars and shakes. Across our portfolio, we will launch more than 200 new products as we continue to respond to the evolving tastes and needs of consumers. Number two, becoming a leader in packaged fresh foods, a growing $18.6 billion category, in which Bolthouse Farms has given us a solid foundation and is now expanding with the launch of Bolthouse Farms Kids, an innovation portfolio of healthy snacks and beverages for children. Number three, expanding in developing markets in Asia and Latin America, building on our footholds in China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Mexico. And finally, increasing the availability of all of our products in all channels, including immediate consumption channels and e-commerce. We will fund our growth by aggressively managing our costs and margin. Furthermore, we will become a high-performance company as we continue to drive agile decision-making, own our results and attract and retain world-class talent to further diversify our team. \r\nIn fiscal 2015, we expect to deliver growth of 1% to 2% in sales and between 0% to 2% in adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS from continuing operations on a 52-week basis. This guidance reflects the impact of some significant headwinds that will affect year-over-year comparisons. Importantly, while we will continue to invest in our platforms for long-term growth, we are prepared to take additional actions if these headwinds accelerate. It is important to note that our growth in fiscal 2015 won't be evenly distributed across quarters. Our first quarter comparison will be favorable because in fiscal 2014, we experienced retailer inventory movements and later Thanksgiving holiday timing that pushed sales into the second quarter. We expect a larger amount of holiday sales this year to shift back to the first quarter. As a result, looking at our business performance on a first half basis versus a quarterly basis will be more meaningful. \r\nWe continue to believe that our long-term growth targets of 3% to 4% in organic sales, 4% to 6% in EBIT and 5% to 7% in EPS are achievable. However, we recognize, as we said at our Investor Day, that further portfolio reconfiguration, including smart external development, may be required to deliver and sustain growth at this level. We have meaningfully changed the composition of our portfolio and are following through on our commitment to diversify our business into faster-growing spaces. But we know it will take some time to realize the full promise of our new platforms, and we know that we stand at a critical juncture. \r\nIn closing, I believe it is essential to balance optimism with realism. Consumers are changing in profound ways. At Campbell, we're putting the consumer first and adapting quickly to the new normal of our world. While remaining true to our core beliefs, we have opened our minds to new ways of thinking about our business. To win in the long term, food companies will have to embrace change and lead change. And we are doing this at Campbell. I look forward to answering your questions in a few minutes. And I'll now turn the call over to Anthony DiSilvestro.\n\n---\n\nGood morning, and thanks, Denise. I'll walk through our fourth quarter results and segment highlights, followed by a look at our fiscal year results. As Jennifer indicated, both our fourth quarter and fiscal year results include an extra week compared to the prior year. I'll wrap up with a look at our fiscal 2015 guidance, which will be presented on a 52-to-52-week basis. As usual, my discussion of results will exclude items impacting comparability, which are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliations. \r\nFor the fourth quarter, we reported net sales from continuing operations of $1,852,000,000, an increase of 7% versus the year-ago quarter. These sales results include a 7 point benefit from the 53rd week and a 3 point contribution from our Kelsen and Plum acquisitions. Excluding the 53rd week, acquisitions and a negative impact of currency, organic net sales decreased by 2%, driven by declines in our U.S. Simple Meals and Global Baking and Snacking segments, partly offset by gains in Bolthouse and Foodservice. Adjusted EBIT increased 25% to $259 million. The increase was primarily due to lower administrative expenses and the benefit of the 53rd week, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.49, a 14% increase versus the prior year, reflecting EBIT growth, partly offset by a higher effective tax rate. \r\nThe next slide shows the composition of our sales performance. As you can see, there was no impact from volume/mix and pricing. The organic sales decrease of 2 points reflects increased promotional spending, primarily related to higher rates of spending to remain competitive in our Global Baking and Snacking segment. Unfavorable currency had a 1 point impact due to the Australian and Canadian dollars weakening against the U.S. dollar. The acquisition of Kelsen and 7 additional weeks of Plum added 3 points. The benefit of the 53rd week added 7 points to sales growth. \r\nOur adjusted gross margin percentage declined by 240 basis points to 34.3%. Of the decline, 210 basis points came from the base business and 30 basis points was the impact of acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the decline in gross margin was primarily due to increased supply chain costs, cost inflation and higher promotional spending, partly offset by productivity improvements. To give this some context, the fourth quarter is a relatively small quarter for us and the increase in supply chain costs negatively impacted gross margin by about 2 points. This included the impact of fixed cost absorption compared to last year and mark-to-market losses on open commodity contracts. Importantly, going forward, we estimate that our gross margin percentage for the full year of 2015 will be comparable to this year. \r\nMarketing and selling expenses for the quarter decreased by $2 million to $189 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses, lower selling expenses and the impact of currency, partly offset by the impact of acquisitions. A&C for the quarter and the year fell 2%, while total marketing support, including trade spending, rose for both periods. Administrative expenses decreased $46 million to $149 million, primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs and cost savings from recent restructuring initiatives. \r\nNow let's look at below-the-line items. For the quarter, net interest expense of $30 million was comparable to the prior year quarter as a lower debt balance and lower interest rates were offset by the impact of the additional week. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 33.2%, an increase of 8.5 points versus the prior year. The 2013 rate was significantly lower, benefiting from lower taxes on foreign earnings. Reflecting the impact of the higher tax rate, both adjusted earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 14%. \r\nFourth quarter segment sales results and the organic growth rates are shown on the next slide. Global Baking and Snacking segment, our largest segment by sales in the quarter, delivered $628 million in sales, including a $32 million contribution from Kelsen. Organic sales declined 2% versus the prior year, with declines at Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's. The sales decline in Pepperidge Farm was driven by increased promotional spending, partly offset by volume gains. Sales of cookies and crackers were comparable to prior year, with gains in Goldfish snack crackers offset by declines in Pepperidge Farm adult cracker varieties. Sales of frozen and other products declined while sales of fresh bakery products increased, driven by volume gains in bread and rolls. The sales decrease in Arnott's was due to weakness in Australia, primarily in savory and sweet varieties, partly offset by continued strong sales growth in Indonesia. \r\nOur U.S. Simple Meals segment delivered $518 million in sales, including $32 million of sales from Plum. Organic sales decreased 5% versus the prior year. Within the segment, U.S. Soup organic sales decreased 10%, including a 7 point decline due to movement in retailer inventory. As you may recall, we ended the third quarter with inventory levels higher than the prior year due to the later timing of the Easter holiday. As we ended fiscal 2014, retailer inventory levels were comparable to a year ago. Our consumer takeaway of soup in measured channels was down 3% in the quarter. Organic sales of other Simple Meals increased by 2%, driven by gains in Campbell's dinner sauces and Prego pasta sauces. \r\nOur Bolthouse Farms and Foodservice segment posted $334 million in sales. It was our best-performing segment, as organic sales increased 4%. Double-digit growth in Bolthouse Farms' premium refrigerated beverages and salad dressings was partly offset by decreases in North America Foodservice. International Simple Meals and Beverages delivered $188 million in sales. Organic sales were comparable to the prior year, as declines in Latin America and the Asia Pacific region were partly offset by gains in Canada. U.S. Beverages delivered sales of $184 million. Organic sales decreased 1% due to declines in V8 V-Fusion, partly offset by gains in V8 Splash beverages and V8 Vegetable Juice. Excluding the sales declines associated with the continuing transition to our new immediate consumption route-to-market, organic sales would have been up modestly in the quarter. \r\nOperating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals increased 4% to $114 million. The improvement was primarily due to the 53rd week and lower administrative and marketing expenses, partly offset by the decline in U.S. Soup sales and a lower gross margin percentage. Operating earnings for Global Baking and Snacking increased 17% to $98 million, primarily driven by lower administrative expenses and the extra week, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage. The increase reflected earnings growth in Pepperidge Farm and the addition of Kelsen Group's operating results. Earnings for Arnott's were comparable to the prior year quarter. Operating earnings for U.S. Beverages more than doubled to $43 million. The gain was primarily driven by lower administrative, selling and marketing expenses and the benefit of the 53rd week. Operating earnings within Bolthouse and Foodservice gained 16% to $29 million. The increase was primarily due to lower administrative expenses and the benefit of the 53rd week, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage and higher marketing expenses as we continue to support the Bolthouse Farms brand. In International Simple Meals and Beverages, operating earnings totaled $21 million, an increase of 15%, primarily due to a higher gross margin percentage, driven by productivity improvement and the benefit of the 53rd week. \r\nOur full year results, as shown on this chart, were consistent with our most recent guidance for sales, EBIT and EPS. For the year, net sales were up 3% while organic net sales decreased 1%. Declines in U.S. Beverages and International Simple Meals and Beverages were partly offset by gains in the Bolthouse and Foodservice segments. Adjusted EBIT increased 4% on lower administrative expenses, a 3 point benefit from the 53rd week and lower marketing expenses, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage and the organic sales decline. Adjusted earnings per share increased 2% to $2.53, including an $0.08 of benefit from the 53rd week. \r\nFor the fiscal year, sales grew 3%, driven by a 3 point contribution from acquisitions and a 2 point benefit from the 53rd week, minus 1 point each from lower organic sales and unfavorable currency translation. Organic sales decreased 1% as the impact of higher promotional spending was partly offset by higher selling prices. Our adjusted gross margin percentage declined by 190 basis points to 35.4%. The decline in gross margin was primarily attributable to cost inflation, higher promotional expense, increased supply chain cost and the unfavorable impact of acquisitions, partly offset by productivity improvements and higher selling prices. The rate increase in cost of goods sold was approximately 4% for the year, in line with our estimate, partly offset by productivity savings of 3%. \r\nMarketing and selling expenses decreased 1% or $12 million. The change was primarily due to lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses, the impact of currency, lower marketing overhead expenses and lower selling expenses, partly offset by the impact of acquisitions. Administrative expenses decreased 15% or $104 million, primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs, cost savings from restructuring initiatives and lower pension costs, partly offset by the impact of acquisitions. \r\nFor the fiscal year, net interest expense decreased 5% or $6 million, primarily due to lower average interest rates on our debt portfolio. The adjusted tax rate for the fiscal year was 31.7%, a 1.9 point increase versus the prior year, which benefited from lower taxes on foreign earnings and the favorable settlement of certain U.S. state tax matters. Adjusted earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 2%. \r\nI'll briefly comment on full year segment results. In the U.S. Simple Meals segment, organic sales were comparable to a strong prior year, which saw sales grow 5%. Within the segment, U.S. Soup organic sales decreased 2% while sales of other Simple Meals increased by 4%, primarily due to growth in Prego pasta sauces and Campbell's dinner sauces. Our Global Baking and Snacking segment includes a $193 million contribution from Kelsen. Organic sales were comparable to the prior year, as sales growth in Indonesia and Pepperidge Farm, driven by Goldfish, were offset by declines in Arnott's in Australia. Our Bolthouse and Foodservice segment had organic sales growth of 2% with double-digit gains in Bolthouse Farms premium refrigerated beverages and salad dressings, partly offset by declines in North America Foodservice. Organic sales for International Simple Meals and Beverages decreased by 3% with declines in Latin America, Canada and the Asia Pacific region. U.S. Beverages organic sales decreased 4% due to sales declines in our V8 V-Fusion multiserve beverages, as well as weakness in our single-serve products as we continue to transition to our new distribution network for the immediate consumption channel. \r\nCommenting on full year segment earnings. U.S. Simple Meals operating earnings decreased 2% to $714 million, as a lower gross margin percentage and expenses related to the November 2013 Plum recall were partly offset by lower administrative expenses, lower marketing expenses and a benefit of the extra week. Global Baking and Snacking earnings gained 5% to $332 million. The increase was primarily driven by lower administrative expenses, the acquisition of Kelsen, lower marketing expenses and the benefit of the 53rd week, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage and the unfavorable impact of currency. The increase reflected growth in Pepperidge Farm and Kelsen Group's operating results, partly offset by lower earnings in Arnott's. U.S. Beverages operating earnings increased 6% to $127 million, primarily driven by lower administrative and marketing expenses, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage and lower volumes. Bolthouse and Foodservice operating earnings increased 1%, primarily due to lower administrative expenses, increase in sales and the benefit of the 53rd week, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage and increased marketing for Bolthouse Farms. International Simple Meals and Beverages operating earnings decreased 2% to $106 million in the fiscal year. The decrease was primarily driven by volume declines and the unfavorable impact of currency, partly offset by lower administrative expenses, a higher gross margin percentage and lower selling expense. \r\nOn the next slide, you can see the sales performance of U.S. Soup, excluding the estimated impact of the 53rd week. Sales declined 2% compared to the prior year, in which soup sales rose 5%. Consumer takeaway in measured channels also declined by 2%, as soup inventory levels at retailers at year end were comparable with 2013. For the year, sales of condensed soups decreased 3%, driven primarily by declines in eating varieties. Ready-to-serve soup sales declined 6% with lower sales across the RTS portfolio. Broth had a very strong year, with sales increasing by 8%, driven by stronger marketing programs, innovation and distribution gains. \r\nHere's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance in the past year and our share performance as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending August 3, 2014, the category as a whole declined 1.1%. Our sales in measured channels declined 2%, with low single-digit declines in condensed and ready-to-serve soups, partly offset by high single-digit growth in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share, a decrease of 50 basis points in the period. All other branded players collectively had a share of 28%, with private label at 13%. \r\nCash flow from operations was $899 million, compared with $1,019,000,000 in the prior year. The decline was primarily due to lower cash earnings and taxes paid on the divestiture of the European Simple Meals business, partly offset by lower working capital requirements. Capital expenditures of $347 million increased from $336 million a year ago. Net debt decreased by $337 million to $3,783,000,000. \r\nNow I'll talk about our fiscal 2015 guidance. As we've stated, fiscal 2014 comprised 53 weeks, which includes 1 additional week. As shown on the chart, we estimate that the extra week benefited sales by 2 points, EBIT by 3 points and EPS by $0.08 per share. On a 52-week adjusted basis in 2014, we delivered $8,139,000,000 in sales, $1,244,000,000 in EBIT and EPS of $2.45. These 52-week numbers are the base for our fiscal 2015 guidance. As we stated at our recent Investor Day, while we expect to achieve growth in 2015, we do not expect to achieve our long-term target growth rate. For fiscal 2015, we expect continuing operations to grow sales by 1% to 2%, adjusted EBIT to grow between 0% and 2% and EPS to grow 0% to 2%, or $2.45 to $2.50 per share. \r\nTurning to some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance. We expect inflation in cost of products sold of approximately 3% to 4%, driven by double-digit increases in dairy, meats and tomatoes. Cost inflation will be mostly offset by estimated productivity gains of 3% as a percentage of cost of products sold. We expect our gross margin percentage to be comparable to last year as we realize some gains in net pricing and wrap some one-time costs, most notably the Plum recall. The anticipated return of incentive compensation to targeted levels represents a 4 point headwind at EBIT, or approximately $0.09 per share, the majority of which will flow through our administrative expense line. We expect that the benefits from our restructuring initiatives, including the program initiated in the fourth quarter, will partly offset the incentive compensation impact. The effective tax rate is projected to be in the 31% to 32% range, comparable to fiscal 2014. This guidance assumes a modest EPS contribution from share repurchases, as we anticipate resuming our strategic share repurchase program in 2014. We forecast capital expenditures to increase by $50 million to approximately $400 million, as we increase funding for capacity expansion projects for Goldfish, Bolthouse Farms, aseptic broth and our business in Indonesia. \r\nAs Denise has already mentioned, given our performance in the first half last year, we expect stronger performance in the first quarter and softer performance in the second quarter, which should add up to a first half that's more consistent with our annual guidance. Thank you, and I will turn it back to Jennifer.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Anthony. At this time, we'll conduct a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Jennifer Driscoll (Executives)】\nThanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Call and Webcast for Campbell Soup Company. With me here in New Jersey today are: Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Anthony DiSilvestro, our Chief Financial Officer; and Anna Choi, Senior Manager of Investor Relations. \r\nI'm going to start things off with a few reminders, including items impacting comparability and our quarterly earnings dates for fiscal 2015. Denise will follow with her perspective on the quarter and the year and our plans for fiscal 2015. Anthony will then discuss our financial results for the quarter and full year, finishing with our expectations for fiscal 2015. And after that, we'll take your questions. As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You'll find the slides posted on our website this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com and on our IR app, which is available through Google or Apple. Please keep in mind that our call is open to members of the media, who are participating in listen-only mode. \r\nToday's presentation includes forward-looking statements, which reflect Campbell's current expectations about future plans and performance. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to inherent risks. Please refer to Slide 3 in the presentation or to Campbell's most recent 10-K and SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statement. \r\nNow I'd like to remind you about items impacting comparability. As we said in this morning's news release, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded $21 million of pretax restructuring charges and restructuring-related costs to improve our supply chain efficiency in Australia, to reduce overhead across the organization and for previously announced initiatives. We also recorded an additional $4 million pretax settlement charge associated with the U.S. pension plan. Last year in the fourth quarter, we recorded $30 million of pretax restructuring charges and restructuring-related costs to improve our U.S. supply chain infrastructure, to expand access to manufacturing and distribution capabilities in Mexico, to improve the Pepperidge Farm supply chain and to reduce overhead in North America. Our comparisons in fiscal 2014 with fiscal 2013 will exclude previously announced items as shown on Slide 4. \r\nSo now let me remind you that we will use non-GAAP measures to enhance our explanations. We provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure as an appendix to the slides accompanying our presentation. Because our guidance for fiscal 2015 is on 52 weeks versus 52 weeks, we show the estimated impact of the extra week in fiscal 2014 on sales and earnings as well. These slides, along with our earnings release and selected quarterly and annual financials, also can be found on our website, which is available online or on your mobile device with the Campbell IR app. \r\nLast, please mark your calendars for our planned fiscal 2015 earnings dates, shown on Slide 6. Like this quarter, the dates are a little later than usual due to the 53rd week, which you'll be hearing about a lot on this call. November 25 is when we plan to report first quarter earnings. The next 3 earnings dates are February 25 of 2015, May 22 of 2015 and September 4 of 2015. \r\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Denise.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nThank you, Jennifer, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. At our Investor Day in July, I told you that I remain confident that our strategy to reshape Campbell by strengthening our core business and expanding into faster-growing spaces is the right course for our company.  But I also know that it will take more time than we originally anticipated to achieve our long-term growth targets. Our industry is now in a period of profound change and challenge, and there has been a meaningful decline in the performance of the packaged foods sector. Forces like the economic environment, the transformation of consumers' food preferences with regard to health and wellness and their demand for greater transparency, the powerful social and demographic changes and the rise of e-commerce are all driving significant changes in consumer behavior with respect to food. \r\nWith this as background, today, I will focus most of my remarks on our performance for full year 2014 and our expectations for fiscal 2015. But first, I will briefly comment on our fourth quarter results. Our fourth quarter results benefited from the extra week in the fiscal year, which was the significant driver in the quarter, as we delivered 7% sales growth and double-digit growth in adjusted EBIT and EPS. Organic sales in the quarter decreased 2% as our core business continued to underperform in a challenging consumer environment. \r\nTurning to our full year results in 2014. Including the 53rd week and the benefit of acquisitions, Campbell delivered growth in both sales and adjusted earnings. We were encouraged by the performance of the businesses we acquired in the last 2 fiscal years as part of our strategy to reshape Campbell's growth trajectory. But we were not satisfied with the performance of our core business. And our organic sales results for the year reflected the extremely difficult market conditions, which are impacting the food business. \r\nConsistent with our most recent guidance, sales from continuing operations increased 3% to nearly $8.3 billion, benefiting from acquisitions and an extra week in the fiscal year. Organic sales declined 1%. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes from continuing operations grew 4% to nearly $1.3 billion, and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 2% to $2.53. \r\nIn U.S. Simple Meals, we delivered growth in sauces with higher sales of Prego pasta sauces and Campbell's dinner sauces. But after growing 5% in fiscal 2013, sales declined in U.S. Soup, as organic growth in Swanson Broth, which increased 8%, was more than offset by declines in ready-to-serve and condensed soups amid softer consumption. In Global Baking and Snacking, the acquisition of Kelsen Group contributed $193 million in sales. We had modest growth in Pepperidge Farm, including continued gains in our Goldfish franchise and fresh bakery. We had solid growth in Indonesia. As we expected, sales declined in our business in Australia. As we outlined at our Investor Day in July, we have initiated turnaround plans to reinvigorate both our Australian business and our U.S. Beverages business, which also declined for the year. \r\nOverall, we are embracing change and continuing to diversify our portfolio. We are building our presence in packaged fresh and other faster-growing spaces, in strategically important geographies outside of our developed markets and in channels that will make our products available everywhere consumers shop. In fiscal 2014, we achieved some key milestones in the execution of these strategies. \r\nWe completed our acquisition of Kelsen Group, which has given us a valuable growth platform, with 40% of its sales of baked snacks in China and Hong Kong. We invested in our first marketing programs to build the Bolthouse Farms brand and expanded the distribution of Bolthouse products, driving solid sales growth and share gains of super premium beverages in measured channels. Internationally, we divested our slow-growing European Simple Meals business to focus on growth opportunities in Asia and Latin America and expanded our sweet biscuit business in Indonesia, a key developing market. In January, we transitioned to a new U.S. network of distributors for our single-serve beverages. Over time, we expect this network to drive immediate consumption growth for both our V8 and Bolthouse Farms brands. We increased our digital and e-commerce capabilities to enhance our connection with consumers, who are engaging with brands in new ways. We continue to drive consumer-focused innovation, with new products equaling 11% of list sales on a rolling 3 basis.  Across our portfolio, we reduced overhead cost, which is critical to funding our growth. Finally, we reflected on our company's purpose, which we've expressed in 7 words: Real food that matters for life's moments. This will be the compass that guides our decisions as we aspire to become a $10 billion company within the next 5 years. It affirms our connections to the core values that have inspired trust in Campbell in the past and it bridges us to the priorities of new generations. \r\nNow that 2014 is behind us, I want to give you a brief overview of our plans for fiscal 2015. We will take further action to drive growth in our important U.S. Soup portfolio and improve category performance. To do this, we will continue to elevate quality, increase our brand-building and drive more innovation, including our first Campbell's organic soups. We intend to expand in the premium soup segment, strengthen ready-to-serve soups and grow our #1 position in condensed soups and broth. We will drive growth in Pepperidge Farm by executing against all the drivers of demand, including increased innovation, particularly in the back half of the year. We will revitalize our shelf-stable U.S. Beverage business by leveraging innovation and the powerful equities of the V8 brand in vegetable nutrition to capitalize on the juicing trend with affordable juicing. We will continue to stabilize our Australian business and rejuvenate sales of Arnott's biscuits in that key market. In faster-growing spaces, our acquisitions of Bolthouse Farms, Plum and Kelsen have diversified our nearly $8.3 billion portfolio as we continue to shift our center of gravity. We expect all 3 of these businesses to grow the top line as we expand distribution. \r\nTo continue to drive our expansion into faster-growing spaces, we will focus on 4 key platforms under our long-term strategy. Number one, accelerating breakthrough innovation, including continued expansion in Campbell's dinner sauces and plans this year to extend the V8 brand into adult on-the-go nutrition with protein bars and shakes. Across our portfolio, we will launch more than 200 new products as we continue to respond to the evolving tastes and needs of consumers. Number two, becoming a leader in packaged fresh foods, a growing $18.6 billion category, in which Bolthouse Farms has given us a solid foundation and is now expanding with the launch of Bolthouse Farms Kids, an innovation portfolio of healthy snacks and beverages for children. Number three, expanding in developing markets in Asia and Latin America, building on our footholds in China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Mexico. And finally, increasing the availability of all of our products in all channels, including immediate consumption channels and e-commerce. We will fund our growth by aggressively managing our costs and margin. Furthermore, we will become a high-performance company as we continue to drive agile decision-making, own our results and attract and retain world-class talent to further diversify our team. \r\nIn fiscal 2015, we expect to deliver growth of 1% to 2% in sales and between 0% to 2% in adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS from continuing operations on a 52-week basis. This guidance reflects the impact of some significant headwinds that will affect year-over-year comparisons. Importantly, while we will continue to invest in our platforms for long-term growth, we are prepared to take additional actions if these headwinds accelerate. It is important to note that our growth in fiscal 2015 won't be evenly distributed across quarters. Our first quarter comparison will be favorable because in fiscal 2014, we experienced retailer inventory movements and later Thanksgiving holiday timing that pushed sales into the second quarter. We expect a larger amount of holiday sales this year to shift back to the first quarter. As a result, looking at our business performance on a first half basis versus a quarterly basis will be more meaningful. \r\nWe continue to believe that our long-term growth targets of 3% to 4% in organic sales, 4% to 6% in EBIT and 5% to 7% in EPS are achievable. However, we recognize, as we said at our Investor Day, that further portfolio reconfiguration, including smart external development, may be required to deliver and sustain growth at this level. We have meaningfully changed the composition of our portfolio and are following through on our commitment to diversify our business into faster-growing spaces. But we know it will take some time to realize the full promise of our new platforms, and we know that we stand at a critical juncture. \r\nIn closing, I believe it is essential to balance optimism with realism. Consumers are changing in profound ways. At Campbell, we're putting the consumer first and adapting quickly to the new normal of our world. While remaining true to our core beliefs, we have opened our minds to new ways of thinking about our business. To win in the long term, food companies will have to embrace change and lead change. And we are doing this at Campbell. I look forward to answering your questions in a few minutes. And I'll now turn the call over to Anthony DiSilvestro.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Anthony DiSilvestro (Executives)】\nGood morning, and thanks, Denise. I'll walk through our fourth quarter results and segment highlights, followed by a look at our fiscal year results. As Jennifer indicated, both our fourth quarter and fiscal year results include an extra week compared to the prior year. I'll wrap up with a look at our fiscal 2015 guidance, which will be presented on a 52-to-52-week basis. As usual, my discussion of results will exclude items impacting comparability, which are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliations. \r\nFor the fourth quarter, we reported net sales from continuing operations of $1,852,000,000, an increase of 7% versus the year-ago quarter. These sales results include a 7 point benefit from the 53rd week and a 3 point contribution from our Kelsen and Plum acquisitions. Excluding the 53rd week, acquisitions and a negative impact of currency, organic net sales decreased by 2%, driven by declines in our U.S. Simple Meals and Global Baking and Snacking segments, partly offset by gains in Bolthouse and Foodservice. Adjusted EBIT increased 25% to $259 million. The increase was primarily due to lower administrative expenses and the benefit of the 53rd week, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.49, a 14% increase versus the prior year, reflecting EBIT growth, partly offset by a higher effective tax rate. \r\nThe next slide shows the composition of our sales performance. As you can see, there was no impact from volume/mix and pricing. The organic sales decrease of 2 points reflects increased promotional spending, primarily related to higher rates of spending to remain competitive in our Global Baking and Snacking segment. Unfavorable currency had a 1 point impact due to the Australian and Canadian dollars weakening against the U.S. dollar. The acquisition of Kelsen and 7 additional weeks of Plum added 3 points. The benefit of the 53rd week added 7 points to sales growth. \r\nOur adjusted gross margin percentage declined by 240 basis points to 34.3%. Of the decline, 210 basis points came from the base business and 30 basis points was the impact of acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the decline in gross margin was primarily due to increased supply chain costs, cost inflation and higher promotional spending, partly offset by productivity improvements. To give this some context, the fourth quarter is a relatively small quarter for us and the increase in supply chain costs negatively impacted gross margin by about 2 points. This included the impact of fixed cost absorption compared to last year and mark-to-market losses on open commodity contracts. Importantly, going forward, we estimate that our gross margin percentage for the full year of 2015 will be comparable to this year. \r\nMarketing and selling expenses for the quarter decreased by $2 million to $189 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses, lower selling expenses and the impact of currency, partly offset by the impact of acquisitions. A&C for the quarter and the year fell 2%, while total marketing support, including trade spending, rose for both periods. Administrative expenses decreased $46 million to $149 million, primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs and cost savings from recent restructuring initiatives. \r\nNow let's look at below-the-line items. For the quarter, net interest expense of $30 million was comparable to the prior year quarter as a lower debt balance and lower interest rates were offset by the impact of the additional week. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 33.2%, an increase of 8.5 points versus the prior year. The 2013 rate was significantly lower, benefiting from lower taxes on foreign earnings. Reflecting the impact of the higher tax rate, both adjusted earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 14%. \r\nFourth quarter segment sales results and the organic growth rates are shown on the next slide. Global Baking and Snacking segment, our largest segment by sales in the quarter, delivered $628 million in sales, including a $32 million contribution from Kelsen. Organic sales declined 2% versus the prior year, with declines at Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's. The sales decline in Pepperidge Farm was driven by increased promotional spending, partly offset by volume gains. Sales of cookies and crackers were comparable to prior year, with gains in Goldfish snack crackers offset by declines in Pepperidge Farm adult cracker varieties. Sales of frozen and other products declined while sales of fresh bakery products increased, driven by volume gains in bread and rolls. The sales decrease in Arnott's was due to weakness in Australia, primarily in savory and sweet varieties, partly offset by continued strong sales growth in Indonesia. \r\nOur U.S. Simple Meals segment delivered $518 million in sales, including $32 million of sales from Plum. Organic sales decreased 5% versus the prior year. Within the segment, U.S. Soup organic sales decreased 10%, including a 7 point decline due to movement in retailer inventory. As you may recall, we ended the third quarter with inventory levels higher than the prior year due to the later timing of the Easter holiday. As we ended fiscal 2014, retailer inventory levels were comparable to a year ago. Our consumer takeaway of soup in measured channels was down 3% in the quarter. Organic sales of other Simple Meals increased by 2%, driven by gains in Campbell's dinner sauces and Prego pasta sauces. \r\nOur Bolthouse Farms and Foodservice segment posted $334 million in sales. It was our best-performing segment, as organic sales increased 4%. Double-digit growth in Bolthouse Farms' premium refrigerated beverages and salad dressings was partly offset by decreases in North America Foodservice. International Simple Meals and Beverages delivered $188 million in sales. Organic sales were comparable to the prior year, as declines in Latin America and the Asia Pacific region were partly offset by gains in Canada. U.S. Beverages delivered sales of $184 million. Organic sales decreased 1% due to declines in V8 V-Fusion, partly offset by gains in V8 Splash beverages and V8 Vegetable Juice. Excluding the sales declines associated with the continuing transition to our new immediate consumption route-to-market, organic sales would have been up modestly in the quarter. \r\nOperating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals increased 4% to $114 million. The improvement was primarily due to the 53rd week and lower administrative and marketing expenses, partly offset by the decline in U.S. Soup sales and a lower gross margin percentage. Operating earnings for Global Baking and Snacking increased 17% to $98 million, primarily driven by lower administrative expenses and the extra week, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage. The increase reflected earnings growth in Pepperidge Farm and the addition of Kelsen Group's operating results. Earnings for Arnott's were comparable to the prior year quarter. Operating earnings for U.S. Beverages more than doubled to $43 million. The gain was primarily driven by lower administrative, selling and marketing expenses and the benefit of the 53rd week. Operating earnings within Bolthouse and Foodservice gained 16% to $29 million. The increase was primarily due to lower administrative expenses and the benefit of the 53rd week, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage and higher marketing expenses as we continue to support the Bolthouse Farms brand. In International Simple Meals and Beverages, operating earnings totaled $21 million, an increase of 15%, primarily due to a higher gross margin percentage, driven by productivity improvement and the benefit of the 53rd week. \r\nOur full year results, as shown on this chart, were consistent with our most recent guidance for sales, EBIT and EPS. For the year, net sales were up 3% while organic net sales decreased 1%. Declines in U.S. Beverages and International Simple Meals and Beverages were partly offset by gains in the Bolthouse and Foodservice segments. Adjusted EBIT increased 4% on lower administrative expenses, a 3 point benefit from the 53rd week and lower marketing expenses, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage and the organic sales decline. Adjusted earnings per share increased 2% to $2.53, including an $0.08 of benefit from the 53rd week. \r\nFor the fiscal year, sales grew 3%, driven by a 3 point contribution from acquisitions and a 2 point benefit from the 53rd week, minus 1 point each from lower organic sales and unfavorable currency translation. Organic sales decreased 1% as the impact of higher promotional spending was partly offset by higher selling prices. Our adjusted gross margin percentage declined by 190 basis points to 35.4%. The decline in gross margin was primarily attributable to cost inflation, higher promotional expense, increased supply chain cost and the unfavorable impact of acquisitions, partly offset by productivity improvements and higher selling prices. The rate increase in cost of goods sold was approximately 4% for the year, in line with our estimate, partly offset by productivity savings of 3%. \r\nMarketing and selling expenses decreased 1% or $12 million. The change was primarily due to lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses, the impact of currency, lower marketing overhead expenses and lower selling expenses, partly offset by the impact of acquisitions. Administrative expenses decreased 15% or $104 million, primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs, cost savings from restructuring initiatives and lower pension costs, partly offset by the impact of acquisitions. \r\nFor the fiscal year, net interest expense decreased 5% or $6 million, primarily due to lower average interest rates on our debt portfolio. The adjusted tax rate for the fiscal year was 31.7%, a 1.9 point increase versus the prior year, which benefited from lower taxes on foreign earnings and the favorable settlement of certain U.S. state tax matters. Adjusted earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 2%. \r\nI'll briefly comment on full year segment results. In the U.S. Simple Meals segment, organic sales were comparable to a strong prior year, which saw sales grow 5%. Within the segment, U.S. Soup organic sales decreased 2% while sales of other Simple Meals increased by 4%, primarily due to growth in Prego pasta sauces and Campbell's dinner sauces. Our Global Baking and Snacking segment includes a $193 million contribution from Kelsen. Organic sales were comparable to the prior year, as sales growth in Indonesia and Pepperidge Farm, driven by Goldfish, were offset by declines in Arnott's in Australia. Our Bolthouse and Foodservice segment had organic sales growth of 2% with double-digit gains in Bolthouse Farms premium refrigerated beverages and salad dressings, partly offset by declines in North America Foodservice. Organic sales for International Simple Meals and Beverages decreased by 3% with declines in Latin America, Canada and the Asia Pacific region. U.S. Beverages organic sales decreased 4% due to sales declines in our V8 V-Fusion multiserve beverages, as well as weakness in our single-serve products as we continue to transition to our new distribution network for the immediate consumption channel. \r\nCommenting on full year segment earnings. U.S. Simple Meals operating earnings decreased 2% to $714 million, as a lower gross margin percentage and expenses related to the November 2013 Plum recall were partly offset by lower administrative expenses, lower marketing expenses and a benefit of the extra week. Global Baking and Snacking earnings gained 5% to $332 million. The increase was primarily driven by lower administrative expenses, the acquisition of Kelsen, lower marketing expenses and the benefit of the 53rd week, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage and the unfavorable impact of currency. The increase reflected growth in Pepperidge Farm and Kelsen Group's operating results, partly offset by lower earnings in Arnott's. U.S. Beverages operating earnings increased 6% to $127 million, primarily driven by lower administrative and marketing expenses, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage and lower volumes. Bolthouse and Foodservice operating earnings increased 1%, primarily due to lower administrative expenses, increase in sales and the benefit of the 53rd week, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage and increased marketing for Bolthouse Farms. International Simple Meals and Beverages operating earnings decreased 2% to $106 million in the fiscal year. The decrease was primarily driven by volume declines and the unfavorable impact of currency, partly offset by lower administrative expenses, a higher gross margin percentage and lower selling expense. \r\nOn the next slide, you can see the sales performance of U.S. Soup, excluding the estimated impact of the 53rd week. Sales declined 2% compared to the prior year, in which soup sales rose 5%. Consumer takeaway in measured channels also declined by 2%, as soup inventory levels at retailers at year end were comparable with 2013. For the year, sales of condensed soups decreased 3%, driven primarily by declines in eating varieties. Ready-to-serve soup sales declined 6% with lower sales across the RTS portfolio. Broth had a very strong year, with sales increasing by 8%, driven by stronger marketing programs, innovation and distribution gains. \r\nHere's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance in the past year and our share performance as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending August 3, 2014, the category as a whole declined 1.1%. Our sales in measured channels declined 2%, with low single-digit declines in condensed and ready-to-serve soups, partly offset by high single-digit growth in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share, a decrease of 50 basis points in the period. All other branded players collectively had a share of 28%, with private label at 13%. \r\nCash flow from operations was $899 million, compared with $1,019,000,000 in the prior year. The decline was primarily due to lower cash earnings and taxes paid on the divestiture of the European Simple Meals business, partly offset by lower working capital requirements. Capital expenditures of $347 million increased from $336 million a year ago. Net debt decreased by $337 million to $3,783,000,000. \r\nNow I'll talk about our fiscal 2015 guidance. As we've stated, fiscal 2014 comprised 53 weeks, which includes 1 additional week. As shown on the chart, we estimate that the extra week benefited sales by 2 points, EBIT by 3 points and EPS by $0.08 per share. On a 52-week adjusted basis in 2014, we delivered $8,139,000,000 in sales, $1,244,000,000 in EBIT and EPS of $2.45. These 52-week numbers are the base for our fiscal 2015 guidance. As we stated at our recent Investor Day, while we expect to achieve growth in 2015, we do not expect to achieve our long-term target growth rate. For fiscal 2015, we expect continuing operations to grow sales by 1% to 2%, adjusted EBIT to grow between 0% and 2% and EPS to grow 0% to 2%, or $2.45 to $2.50 per share. \r\nTurning to some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance. We expect inflation in cost of products sold of approximately 3% to 4%, driven by double-digit increases in dairy, meats and tomatoes. Cost inflation will be mostly offset by estimated productivity gains of 3% as a percentage of cost of products sold. We expect our gross margin percentage to be comparable to last year as we realize some gains in net pricing and wrap some one-time costs, most notably the Plum recall. The anticipated return of incentive compensation to targeted levels represents a 4 point headwind at EBIT, or approximately $0.09 per share, the majority of which will flow through our administrative expense line. We expect that the benefits from our restructuring initiatives, including the program initiated in the fourth quarter, will partly offset the incentive compensation impact. The effective tax rate is projected to be in the 31% to 32% range, comparable to fiscal 2014. This guidance assumes a modest EPS contribution from share repurchases, as we anticipate resuming our strategic share repurchase program in 2014. We forecast capital expenditures to increase by $50 million to approximately $400 million, as we increase funding for capacity expansion projects for Goldfish, Bolthouse Farms, aseptic broth and our business in Indonesia. \r\nAs Denise has already mentioned, given our performance in the first half last year, we expect stronger performance in the first quarter and softer performance in the second quarter, which should add up to a first half that's more consistent with our annual guidance. Thank you, and I will turn it back to Jennifer.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Jennifer Driscoll (Executives)】\nThanks, Anthony. At this time, we'll conduct a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]",
      "transcript_text3": "Just wondering if you could provide an update on the sauces strategy and maybe the progress you're seeing in terms of retailers adopting these dedicated aisle merchandisers and your expectations for the contribution of sauces to growth in fiscal '15.\n\n---\n\nOur sauces strategy is to continue to build the Pace brand. We have, on the docket for F '15, some innovation and brand-building programs. But most of the contribution from sauces will come from the growth in Prego, where we're continuing to expand our white sauces, and also the innovation in our Campbell's dinner sauces, where we've introduced Skillet and Slow Cooker Sauces. And this year, we're introducing Oven Sauces. And that platform continues to build. We now have the majority of retailers giving us an extra 4-foot section in the store as a destination for those particular sauces. So it's a very strong and profitable business for us.\n\n---\n\nDenise, in the prepared remarks, I think you made a comment about remaining committed to investing in the platforms for the long term, but also having a willingness to take additional actions if industry headwinds accelerate. I'm just trying to get a sense of what you meant by those additional actions. Is that a potential for just to be more thoughtful around marketing in the year potentially or incremental restructuring or both or things beyond that, that I didn't mention?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think it's really important that the company, given the fact that we are still having challenges on our organic sales, to continue to invest in these brands and to make sure that we are innovating. And that is going to take the investment that we have in our plans. However, given the volatility in the marketplace, some of the commodity issues that we're facing, et cetera, we are constantly looking for additional opportunities for cost reduction and management of those margins. So that's what I was indicating there. We believe that we've got it balanced. But quite frankly, if there are surprises, we will take extra action to make sure that we deliver what we said we were going to do.\n\n---\n\nGot it. So a little less on the marketing side, where I think you've mentioned even at your Analyst Day, that does need to be -- continue to be bolstered behind some of the new innovation, and maybe more on the cost side potential.\n\n---\n\nCorrect, absolutely.\n\n---\n\nI guess, maybe a little bit of a follow-up to Andrew's question for the long term and then I have kind of a detailed numbers question. But on the long term, why wouldn't you -- and maybe this is a little somewhat semantic, but why wouldn't you change your long-term targets either a little lower, given the environment and the inability to achieve them over the last 3 years, or just say, \"Okay, our long-term targets now include the assumption of M&A\"?\n\n---\n\nYes, the way we're looking at it, Eric, is we need about 1 point more of sales and 2 points of EBIT growth to get to the bottom of the range. And when you think about the puts and takes that we're cycling in F '14, that gave us about 4 points of EBIT pressure in F '15, with a net impact of about $45 million from supply chain cost and incentive compensation. Without this headwind, EBIT would have been consistent with our long-term targets. So we have a line of sight of how to get there. However, we are saying that there may be a call for more M&A to continue to diversify into faster-growing spaces for sustainable achievement of those long-term targets.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then Anthony, if I could just follow up, I don't understand one thing you said about the fiscal '15 assumptions. You've already started out by saying that your targets are going to be -- that fiscal '15 is likely to be less than planned. So is the incentive comp of $45 million, is that a portion of what you would have assumed if you had achieved the targets? I mean, I'm just surprised that -- wouldn't the incentive comp headwinds be lower because you're already at the start of the year assuming a less-than-average year?\n\n---\n\nSo let me clarify, Eric. What I said is that our fiscal 2015 growth rates will be lower than our long-term target growth rates. Those growth rates in F '15 are more consistent with our internal plans. And the 0% to 2% EBIT and EPS growth include the negative headwind from returning incentive compensation to target levels, part of which is offset by restructuring benefits from the programs that we've recently initiated.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Yes. But I guess I don't understand if it's -- if you're starting out the year knowing that you're going to be below your long-term plan, and I realize compensation is a function of several plans or several different time periods, why would you restate or accrue the comp at what I guess is essentially a normal year's level? Do you understand what I'm saying?\n\n---\n\nYes, you might be referring to the multiyear programs. The annual plan resets every year, so that, it certainly goes back to targeted levels. The way the accruals work on the longer-term ones is that you basically adjust to your current expectation so that going forward, right, the increment is more consistent or closer to target.\n\n---\n\nI just wonder if I can get a little more color on the increased supply chain costs. I know that through the year, you had those. I think weather in part was a factor. But it seems like those continued in the fourth quarter as well. Can you give a little color on that? And is that, perhaps in your response to Andrew's question, in part which you would be targeting if there were some more cost-reduction activities?\n\n---\n\nYes, let me -- on the fourth quarter, we had a couple situations in the supply chain that were relatively unique and different than the full year impacts that we saw around, for example, the Plum recall or the impact of the extreme weather on warehousing and distribution costs. What we saw in the fourth quarter is really 2 things and they both add up to being about a 2 point impact on gross margin quarter-over-quarter. The first is the timing of our fixed cost absorption. Last year, we had some favorability. This year, we had some unfavorability. It's a relatively small quarter. We're trueing up some of our fixed cost reserves. And what we saw was a year-on-year negative impact on gross margin. And the second is on our open commodity hedges. So we take forward cover on a majority of our hedgeable items. And what happened in the fourth quarter, the underlying prices of those commodities declined. And so we had to record a loss on some of those open commodity hedges. So those 2 things happen in the fourth quarter. And again, they're not really kind of a recurring thing, which is why I added the comment that looking ahead, we do expect 2015's gross margin percentage to be comparable to this year.\n\n---\n\nAnd Chris, just to build on that, in the fourth quarter last year, we were gearing up and launching Campbell's Homestyle Soups. So that is something that we're cycling this year to the absorption.\n\n---\n\nJust sticking with the Soup category, you've launched a wide range of new soups over the past few years that goes through Slow Kettle, Bisques and so on. And yet the category continues to decline, it seems. What have you learned from those new product launches over the years? And what makes the lineup for fiscal '15 more likely to succeed this time?\n\n---\n\nAlexia, what we're doing in the next year is 2 things: we're improving against our drivers of demand, but we're also investing more in broader platforms to improve total category performance. So each one of the things you listed in and of itself is a single initiative. But when you bundle that into a premium soup platform, we then will be building the expansion of Slow Kettle and the introduction of Campbell organic soup. We're putting premium soup sections in stores so that we know that the consumer for these particular products is younger and more affluent. So that gives us the range in value all the way from condensed soup, all the way up to a premium soup and shelf-stable, and then also in chilled. And so focusing on premium soup platform, we believe, is a faster-growing space for us within the Soup category. The second thing we're doing is Swanson Broth is giving us an expansion to a flavor-infused platform, which is offering consumers creative homemade soup and meal solutions based on the insight of Why I Cook. And then within some of the brands, we have platforms, like pub-inspired Chunky or building out our Campbell Homestyle and Healthy Request soups. So what we've really learned is by bundling these into platforms, what we have to do is improve the total category performance, which has been declining. And if we can do that by bringing new users into the category, we believe that's the best opportunity for growth.\n\n---\n\nJust a follow-up on Soup for this upcoming year. What sort of year-over-year performance would you expect from Simple Meals and Soups specifically. Similar to your overall top line guidance? And where I'm going with this is your innovation, marketing and renovation plans for this year, how would you characterize them versus '14? And what do you think of weather comparisons? Are they a neutral or perhaps negative event for '15 as you're thinking ahead?\n\n---\n\nYes, I would say -- I don't want to give a specific forecast for Simple Meals. But as Denise said, we do expect Soup to grow in 2014. We do expect growth from some of our other areas within Simple Meals. The challenge is that some of these core center store categories have been sluggish of late. And that's kind of what's holding us back. We will flex the marketing to focus against some of the innovation that's going on. So the launch of Oven Sauces and the launch of organic soups, so we'll flex the marketing within there to do that. We expect pretty significant renovation. I mean, Denise talked about 200 new SKUs, a lot of those fit inside the Simple Meals category. Regards to weather, I would say kind of neutral year-on-year. We don't really focus too much on that.\n\n---\n\nYes, the only thing I would add is that we typically plan our innovation at the average in the food business. And so if something performs better than average, we get a benefit from that. But if something performs below that, we believe that by planning to the average, we can balance out.\n\n---\n\nJust a, I guess, maybe a broader question, just trying to conceptualize a little bit where we stand or where we'll go going forward in terms of the core business. I guess over the last few years, right, the challenges -- the challenging environment or the challenges have been really North America, and I guess, Australia. And it's been a combination of the economy or a weak consumer wallet and all the things that would drive that. And then we've also got changing consumer taste. I guess from my perspective, it seems like early on, it was more weak wallet and less sort of consumer taste. And maybe that's changed now. So can you just give us a sense for, kind of, of those items, which ones are really causing the most pressure today? And as you're going forward, which of those 2 do you think are the most important in addressing in terms of sort of getting the base to be where it needs in order to get ourselves back into the algorithm?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, there are several factors, but I'll talk about 2 that are on our watch. And the first one is the impact of SNAP, particularly on the recipients. They're about 12% of our shopper base. And that's correlated to about a 1% decline in sales. They're about 19% of households, in general, based on government data. IRI captures about 12% of them as they do their analysis. And our analysis shows that about 30% of our retail customer base is experiencing greater dollar declines among these households versus their total retail shoppers. So we're continuing to watch that. The second is the shopping patterns of the next generation. We're watching the fact that 18- to 24-year-olds are not necessarily frequenting stores like their parents. Now a lot of them live with their parents, so that might explain some of it. But as we dig deeper in it, some of them haven't even made any trips to either a club store or a mass merchandiser in the last year. So making sure that we're engaging this next generation, where they shop and how they are going to be engaging with brands, is going to be very, very important. So those are 2 things that we think are having a macro impact. There are more.\n\n---\n\nBut is it fair to say, in the near term -- the longer-term thing is getting the Millennials, I guess, or the people in their 20s to engage in the category more. But the more specific thing to turn in the near term would just simply be that financial pressure, the wallet?\n\n---\n\nYes, I would say, being the finance guy, that, that weak wallet has a very significant impact. We're talking about our core category performance and probably something that we can affect the least. And it's certainly impacting some of our center store categories. And unlike the innovation thing, we're doing a lot about innovation, that those things are more in our control. We understand where the consumer is going. We can bring new products. Denise talked about dinner sauces. We have a new line of V8 juices that is more healthy. We have new varieties of Swanson and Chunky and Homestyle and Prego, all those things addressing kind of where the consumer taste is evolving. The hardest one for us to get at obviously is that weak wallet and the impact on our core categories.\n\n---\n\nSo you've talked more recently about pulling back on some of the less productive promotional spending that you've seen through the course of the year and shifting these dollars back to advertising. But with promotion about a 2% headwind to org sales this quarter, I guess it wasn't really evident in Q4. Were you able to make, or have you been able to make these kinds of tactical adjustments you'd hoped to make 2 to 3 months ago? Or is the competitive environment making it difficult to follow through on this?\n\n---\n\nYes, actually for F '15, we have made course corrections based on our F '14 results. And we work with both depth and frequency, depending upon the category and the competition we're facing. And obviously, for competitive reasons, we don't disclose the specifics of our promotions. But we have, like I said, taken that learning and applied it. In general, we aim to keep our total marketing spend, which is the combination of advertising, consumer and trade, at about 25% of list sales. But the marketing mix is going to vary depending upon the brand and the category and the competitive set in that category.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just to clarify, I guess with respect to the marketing and selling costs overall for the full year, my sense is that this should definitely be up year-on-year in absolute terms because of this course correction. But can you just confirm that, that's the right way to think about it on a full year basis, not necessarily quarter-to-quarter?\n\n---\n\nYes, Denise was referring to our total marketing, so advertising, consumer and trade spending, not the selling and marketing line on the P&L, and trying to keep it around 24% to 25% of list sales. I wouldn't expect any significant changes in those percentages year-on-year, '15 versus '14. Maybe some slight changes within them, but nothing significant.\n\n---\n\nI want to drill down a little bit more on gross margin. I think at least for me, that was the biggest surprise in the quarter. Can you help us quantify the Plum recall expenses, as well as the other supply chain expenses, I guess the mark-to-market charges that ate you this year? And then bigger question, thinking forward into next year, you're guiding for inflation to modestly outstrip productivity, as I think Matt was getting at, pricing, net pricing out of promotions has been eroding into the new fiscal year. And you've had this mix issue within your P&L, presumably, as Soup sales lag in some of your lower margin but faster growth piece of the portfolio becoming a bigger piece. So in context of all that, how do we get comfortable with gross margins being flat in fiscal '15?\n\n---\n\nOkay, I can address that because with any planning cycle, there are certainly puts and takes. So I mean, this year, we had the Plum recall that was worth $16 million. As we've discussed in the fourth quarter, we had this issue around losses on open commodity contracts. Both of those are going to turn and go the other way in 2015. But there's been some one-offs or takes in 2015 as well. Most of that Plum recall wrap is going to be offset by unfavorable currency movements at the transaction level. So imports into both Canada and Australia are adversely impacted by the weakening of those currencies. So there's a number of pluses and minuses that kind of net out, with the exception of the incentive compensation headwind. And we've talked about that, it's $45 million. A good portion of that $45 million is going to be offset by the benefit of our restructuring program. We had 3 quarters this year, we've announced restructuring initiatives. Combined, when we fully implement those, it's worth $65 million. We won't get all that in F '15, but we'll get a good portion of that. So we're trying to mitigate that impact. And again, we have a number of puts and takes, and they kind of all balance out, with the exception of that one big one.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's helpful. Switching gears, Denise, to you, on M&A. You've kind of hinted that maybe M&A is in the cards. But you've put out this $10 billion sales bogey in 5 years and even giving you credit for pretty healthy acceleration of your underlying portfolio, you're going to come easily $1 billion-plus short of that without M&A. So a, is that the right way to think about it? And then b, as we contemplate up to $1 billion or more of acquired sales over the next 5 years, how do we think about your prioritization in terms of buying businesses that accelerate the long-term growth of your portfolio versus buying businesses that can have a meaningful impact on both the top and bottom line right out of the gates?\n\n---\n\nYes, well, we continue to evaluate M&A targets that are a good strategic fit, but we have a very disciplined approach. So what I don't want the takeaway to be is that we're going to be reckless about this. We definitely have been looking at specific targets, but we've walked away from more than we made. So the prioritization will be about the places that we've picked, being the Global Baking and Snacking area, the packaged fresh area, health and wellness in North America. Those are 3 areas that we believe that they are our faster-growing spaces for us, based on the strategy that we've laid out. And we do have the financial flexibility to make a meaningful acquisition. But like I said, we're being very disciplined about it.\n\n---\n\nYes, if I could just add to that, I mean, certainly, M&A can play a role as you've seen us do with Bolthouse and Plum and Kelsen in terms of improving our growth profile. And we'll continue to look for opportunities to do that. But we also recognize that in terms of value creation, the best thing we can do is improve the performance of our base business. And Denise has talked about the dual mandates, where we're focused on expanding into higher growth spaces with innovation in packaged fresh and availability in the international businesses that we do own. So it's that combination of improving the base and expanding through M&A that will get us to that $10 billion target.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to ask about Denise's comments about the 4 pillars to accelerate growth, in particular the move into some nontraditional channels. And I'm particularly interested in promo spending has been pretty inefficient, most of your peers have said the same, so, and you even commented about the Millennials not shopping the way their parents do. So I guess my question is really, as promo hasn't really produced the volume lift, can you, first of all, quantify what percentage of your sales is coming from these alternative channels? And then can you talk a little bit about how you will go about getting into, say, C-stores or club? Or maybe you could just give us a few more details on kind of what's behind that comment. And then obviously, those channels are pretty competitive, so just if you could frame that up a little bit, I'd be very interested in hearing that.\n\n---\n\nYes, well, we have the majority of our business still concentrated largely in grocery and mass merchandiser, which gives us lots of opportunity for expansion in other channels. And we believe that we need to make a concerted effort to do so. We've expanded our sales presence and our programming across multiple channels. We're also paying attention to the e-commerce space with many of our large customers. And so we're doing a better job in terms of tailoring programs. In some of these new spaces though, we're not highly efficient right out of the gate, but we're learning and getting better at it. I think most of the promotional situations that we had though this year were more in our traditional channels. And we were working more with frequency and less depth. And in some categories, like baked snacks and soup, that didn't work as well as we expected it to. So we are course correcting.\n\n---\n\nWe have a very significant initiative, again, to the immediate consumption channel, which we've talked about, as we develop our own route-to-market network. At this point, we have over 100 new distributors signed up. That transition is largely complete. We've got over 100,000 doors in terms of coverage. And we expect to see some growth coming from this initiative, probably by the second quarter of fiscal '15.\n\n---\n\nYes, and the original focus on that is Beverages for both V8 and Bolthouse Farms. Yes, and I think our estimate for alternate channels, Diane, is about 10%, somewhere in there.\n\n---\n\nI wanted just to talk a little bit about the gross margins. I mean, when I look really big picture at Campbell Soup, in more than 10 years of data, Denise, we haven't seen a gross margin like this. I mean, 35.4%, I mean, it's remarkable in respect to what Campbell's has produced for so many years. I also believe that at the beginning of the year, you guys thought that the gross margin would actually be kind of flattish on the year, and it was down 190 basis points. So there's a lot of things that have really happened that I think were not easily predictable by the team. The point, and the question is, can you just discuss why gross margins wouldn't have significant risk to the downside ongoing for the very same factors that kind of drove the F '14 numbers? And is it simply all about this $65 million in savings? Is that the lifeline that we're hoping that really stabilizes gross margins?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think the first is we certainly acknowledge what has happened to our gross margin over the last couple of years. And the principal driver of that has been an increasing trade rate. And it has to do with the environment. It has to do with a couple of our businesses, namely U.S. Soup and Australia and more recently, in Pepperidge Farm. And I think the difference -- and certainly, it is a challenging goal. We acknowledge that. But we also acknowledge in order for us to hit our financial targets, we need to do a better job of managing this trade rate closer to flat. We have plans to do that in 2015 with a combination of changes to promote at price points. That's something we didn't have coming into this year, so that obviously has a direct and immediate impact on the amount of trade. We have adjustments to the frequency and around specific promotional events, continuing to learn in terms of what programs are more productive versus less productive, and let's reallocate within the portfolio. I think most of the challenge in Australia is hopefully behind us. We have specific plans to address the issue of late within Pepperidge Farm. So as we look across the portfolio -- and again, it's going to vary by category, but we're looking to hold the trade rate relatively flat. And it is a challenge. But that's our plan and what we're trying to do in 2015, because we know how critical it is to the gross margin to get this trade rate back to flattish.\n\n---\n\nI mean, to state the obvious, it's unsettling to see these gross margins do what they're doing, and then to have confidence in the model. Certainly, '15 will be critical. Can you describe or quantify the size of the commodity impact for the open hedge position that you took in the fourth quarter? If I'm correct, that's a reversible item. So what will happen is that as you actually recognize those, the actual transactions through F '15, what was a headwind in the fourth quarter will become a tailwind within the operating segments as the course of '15 plays through and the hedges are used up?\n\n---\n\nYes, somebody studied hedge accounting. It's about $10 million.\n\n---\n\n$10 million. And then I would go back to Eric's question. Just to state it -- I think I want to state it simply, the $45 million of incentive comp that you've built back into the plan, I think what Eric was getting at is kind of why does all $45 million get back into the budget for the year, when the expectation is that the company will not achieve its long-term targets? And so in simple form, and maybe, and it doesn't mean to come across that harsh. I mean, Denise, maybe the right answer is you just have to pay the team in order to keep the team. I think we all just kind of want to understand the philosophy on the $45 million and what it takes to maintain the excitement of the people running the business.\n\n---\n\nYes, Dave, let me jump in first here, and then Denise can comment if she'd like. Thanks for the second attempt here at an answer. Think about it as 2 parts. There's, again, there's an annual incentive plan which kind of resets each year. And then there's long-term targets that will increase year-on-year, but do not get back to 100% payout. So the annual incentive goes back to target, the long-term one will go up next year, but they don't go anywhere near 100% if they're set against our sales -- our longer-term sales and EPS targets.\n\n---\n\nYes, we definitely have a pay-for-performance compensation system, with sales goals that are higher than our guidance.\n\n---\n\nVery simply on the balance sheet, you had $700 million of debt that matured in August. And I think you had capacity to refinance that with commercial paper. And I guess my question is really twofold. First of all, would you look to refinance a portion of that in the debt capital markets to term out a portion of your floating rate debt? And in terms of capital allocation priorities, do you continue to be focused somewhat on debt reduction for FY '15?\n\n---\n\nSo I can take that. In F '14, we had $700 million of long-term debt maturing. We also had cash flow that enabled us to reduce our total debt level by $300 million to $400 million. So one of them has just been paid off with cash from operations, the other, as you point out, refinanced with commercial paper. As you know, we have pretty good access to capital markets, so we're continuing to evaluate opportunities to come to market. We don't have a specific plan to share with you today on that. But again, we're looking at that pretty closely. In terms of capital allocation priorities, not much has changed there. Obviously, our first priority is to fund our ongoing business; the second would be dividends; third, M&A; and the last would be share repurchase. What's changing in F '15 is that we're going to resume in a modest fashion a return to share repurchases, get a little bit of EPS benefit in F '15. But that would be the only change for us going forward.\n\n---\n\nThanks. And thanks, everybody, for hanging on a little extra time there.

      "transcript_text4": "【質問: John Baumgartner (Analysts)】\nJust wondering if you could provide an update on the sauces strategy and maybe the progress you're seeing in terms of retailers adopting these dedicated aisle merchandisers and your expectations for the contribution of sauces to growth in fiscal '15.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nOur sauces strategy is to continue to build the Pace brand. We have, on the docket for F '15, some innovation and brand-building programs. But most of the contribution from sauces will come from the growth in Prego, where we're continuing to expand our white sauces, and also the innovation in our Campbell's dinner sauces, where we've introduced Skillet and Slow Cooker Sauces. And this year, we're introducing Oven Sauces. And that platform continues to build. We now have the majority of retailers giving us an extra 4-foot section in the store as a destination for those particular sauces. So it's a very strong and profitable business for us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Lazar (Analysts)】\nDenise, in the prepared remarks, I think you made a comment about remaining committed to investing in the platforms for the long term, but also having a willingness to take additional actions if industry headwinds accelerate. I'm just trying to get a sense of what you meant by those additional actions. Is that a potential for just to be more thoughtful around marketing in the year potentially or incremental restructuring or both or things beyond that, that I didn't mention?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nYes, I think it's really important that the company, given the fact that we are still having challenges on our organic sales, to continue to invest in these brands and to make sure that we are innovating. And that is going to take the investment that we have in our plans. However, given the volatility in the marketplace, some of the commodity issues that we're facing, et cetera, we are constantly looking for additional opportunities for cost reduction and management of those margins. So that's what I was indicating there. We believe that we've got it balanced. But quite frankly, if there are surprises, we will take extra action to make sure that we deliver what we said we were going to do.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andrew Lazar (Analysts)】\nGot it. So a little less on the marketing side, where I think you've mentioned even at your Analyst Day, that does need to be -- continue to be bolstered behind some of the new innovation, and maybe more on the cost side potential.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nCorrect, absolutely.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Katzman (Analysts)】\nI guess, maybe a little bit of a follow-up to Andrew's question for the long term and then I have kind of a detailed numbers question. But on the long term, why wouldn't you -- and maybe this is a little somewhat semantic, but why wouldn't you change your long-term targets either a little lower, given the environment and the inability to achieve them over the last 3 years, or just say, \"Okay, our long-term targets now include the assumption of M&A\"?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nYes, the way we're looking at it, Eric, is we need about 1 point more of sales and 2 points of EBIT growth to get to the bottom of the range. And when you think about the puts and takes that we're cycling in F '14, that gave us about 4 points of EBIT pressure in F '15, with a net impact of about $45 million from supply chain cost and incentive compensation. Without this headwind, EBIT would have been consistent with our long-term targets. So we have a line of sight of how to get there. However, we are saying that there may be a call for more M&A to continue to diversify into faster-growing spaces for sustainable achievement of those long-term targets.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Katzman (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then Anthony, if I could just follow up, I don't understand one thing you said about the fiscal '15 assumptions. You've already started out by saying that your targets are going to be -- that fiscal '15 is likely to be less than planned. So is the incentive comp of $45 million, is that a portion of what you would have assumed if you had achieved the targets? I mean, I'm just surprised that -- wouldn't the incentive comp headwinds be lower because you're already at the start of the year assuming a less-than-average year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony DiSilvestro (Executives)】\nSo let me clarify, Eric. What I said is that our fiscal 2015 growth rates will be lower than our long-term target growth rates. Those growth rates in F '15 are more consistent with our internal plans. And the 0% to 2% EBIT and EPS growth include the negative headwind from returning incentive compensation to target levels, part of which is offset by restructuring benefits from the programs that we've recently initiated.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Katzman (Analysts)】\nOkay. Yes. But I guess I don't understand if it's -- if you're starting out the year knowing that you're going to be below your long-term plan, and I realize compensation is a function of several plans or several different time periods, why would you restate or accrue the comp at what I guess is essentially a normal year's level? Do you understand what I'm saying?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony DiSilvestro (Executives)】\nYes, you might be referring to the multiyear programs. The annual plan resets every year, so that, it certainly goes back to targeted levels. The way the accruals work on the longer-term ones is that you basically adjust to your current expectation so that going forward, right, the increment is more consistent or closer to target.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Growe (Analysts)】\nI just wonder if I can get a little more color on the increased supply chain costs. I know that through the year, you had those. I think weather in part was a factor. But it seems like those continued in the fourth quarter as well. Can you give a little color on that? And is that, perhaps in your response to Andrew's question, in part which you would be targeting if there were some more cost-reduction activities?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony DiSilvestro (Executives)】\nYes, let me -- on the fourth quarter, we had a couple situations in the supply chain that were relatively unique and different than the full year impacts that we saw around, for example, the Plum recall or the impact of the extreme weather on warehousing and distribution costs. What we saw in the fourth quarter is really 2 things and they both add up to being about a 2 point impact on gross margin quarter-over-quarter. The first is the timing of our fixed cost absorption. Last year, we had some favorability. This year, we had some unfavorability. It's a relatively small quarter. We're trueing up some of our fixed cost reserves. And what we saw was a year-on-year negative impact on gross margin. And the second is on our open commodity hedges. So we take forward cover on a majority of our hedgeable items. And what happened in the fourth quarter, the underlying prices of those commodities declined. And so we had to record a loss on some of those open commodity hedges. So those 2 things happen in the fourth quarter. And again, they're not really kind of a recurring thing, which is why I added the comment that looking ahead, we do expect 2015's gross margin percentage to be comparable to this year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nAnd Chris, just to build on that, in the fourth quarter last year, we were gearing up and launching Campbell's Homestyle Soups. So that is something that we're cycling this year to the absorption.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alexia Howard (Analysts)】\nJust sticking with the Soup category, you've launched a wide range of new soups over the past few years that goes through Slow Kettle, Bisques and so on. And yet the category continues to decline, it seems. What have you learned from those new product launches over the years? And what makes the lineup for fiscal '15 more likely to succeed this time?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nAlexia, what we're doing in the next year is 2 things: we're improving against our drivers of demand, but we're also investing more in broader platforms to improve total category performance. So each one of the things you listed in and of itself is a single initiative. But when you bundle that into a premium soup platform, we then will be building the expansion of Slow Kettle and the introduction of Campbell organic soup. We're putting premium soup sections in stores so that we know that the consumer for these particular products is younger and more affluent. So that gives us the range in value all the way from condensed soup, all the way up to a premium soup and shelf-stable, and then also in chilled. And so focusing on premium soup platform, we believe, is a faster-growing space for us within the Soup category. The second thing we're doing is Swanson Broth is giving us an expansion to a flavor-infused platform, which is offering consumers creative homemade soup and meal solutions based on the insight of Why I Cook. And then within some of the brands, we have platforms, like pub-inspired Chunky or building out our Campbell Homestyle and Healthy Request soups. So what we've really learned is by bundling these into platforms, what we have to do is improve the total category performance, which has been declining. And if we can do that by bringing new users into the category, we believe that's the best opportunity for growth.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Palmer (Analysts)】\nJust a follow-up on Soup for this upcoming year. What sort of year-over-year performance would you expect from Simple Meals and Soups specifically. Similar to your overall top line guidance? And where I'm going with this is your innovation, marketing and renovation plans for this year, how would you characterize them versus '14? And what do you think of weather comparisons? Are they a neutral or perhaps negative event for '15 as you're thinking ahead?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony DiSilvestro (Executives)】\nYes, I would say -- I don't want to give a specific forecast for Simple Meals. But as Denise said, we do expect Soup to grow in 2014. We do expect growth from some of our other areas within Simple Meals. The challenge is that some of these core center store categories have been sluggish of late. And that's kind of what's holding us back. We will flex the marketing to focus against some of the innovation that's going on. So the launch of Oven Sauces and the launch of organic soups, so we'll flex the marketing within there to do that. We expect pretty significant renovation. I mean, Denise talked about 200 new SKUs, a lot of those fit inside the Simple Meals category. Regards to weather, I would say kind of neutral year-on-year. We don't really focus too much on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nYes, the only thing I would add is that we typically plan our innovation at the average in the food business. And so if something performs better than average, we get a benefit from that. But if something performs below that, we believe that by planning to the average, we can balance out.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Spillane (Analysts)】\nJust a, I guess, maybe a broader question, just trying to conceptualize a little bit where we stand or where we'll go going forward in terms of the core business. I guess over the last few years, right, the challenges -- the challenging environment or the challenges have been really North America, and I guess, Australia. And it's been a combination of the economy or a weak consumer wallet and all the things that would drive that. And then we've also got changing consumer taste. I guess from my perspective, it seems like early on, it was more weak wallet and less sort of consumer taste. And maybe that's changed now. So can you just give us a sense for, kind of, of those items, which ones are really causing the most pressure today? And as you're going forward, which of those 2 do you think are the most important in addressing in terms of sort of getting the base to be where it needs in order to get ourselves back into the algorithm?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, there are several factors, but I'll talk about 2 that are on our watch. And the first one is the impact of SNAP, particularly on the recipients. They're about 12% of our shopper base. And that's correlated to about a 1% decline in sales. They're about 19% of households, in general, based on government data. IRI captures about 12% of them as they do their analysis. And our analysis shows that about 30% of our retail customer base is experiencing greater dollar declines among these households versus their total retail shoppers. So we're continuing to watch that. The second is the shopping patterns of the next generation. We're watching the fact that 18- to 24-year-olds are not necessarily frequenting stores like their parents. Now a lot of them live with their parents, so that might explain some of it. But as we dig deeper in it, some of them haven't even made any trips to either a club store or a mass merchandiser in the last year. So making sure that we're engaging this next generation, where they shop and how they are going to be engaging with brands, is going to be very, very important. So those are 2 things that we think are having a macro impact. There are more.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Spillane (Analysts)】\nBut is it fair to say, in the near term -- the longer-term thing is getting the Millennials, I guess, or the people in their 20s to engage in the category more. But the more specific thing to turn in the near term would just simply be that financial pressure, the wallet?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony DiSilvestro (Executives)】\nYes, I would say, being the finance guy, that, that weak wallet has a very significant impact. We're talking about our core category performance and probably something that we can affect the least. And it's certainly impacting some of our center store categories. And unlike the innovation thing, we're doing a lot about innovation, that those things are more in our control. We understand where the consumer is going. We can bring new products. Denise talked about dinner sauces. We have a new line of V8 juices that is more healthy. We have new varieties of Swanson and Chunky and Homestyle and Prego, all those things addressing kind of where the consumer taste is evolving. The hardest one for us to get at obviously is that weak wallet and the impact on our core categories.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Grainger (Analysts)】\nSo you've talked more recently about pulling back on some of the less productive promotional spending that you've seen through the course of the year and shifting these dollars back to advertising. But with promotion about a 2% headwind to org sales this quarter, I guess it wasn't really evident in Q4. Were you able to make, or have you been able to make these kinds of tactical adjustments you'd hoped to make 2 to 3 months ago? Or is the competitive environment making it difficult to follow through on this?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nYes, actually for F '15, we have made course corrections based on our F '14 results. And we work with both depth and frequency, depending upon the category and the competition we're facing. And obviously, for competitive reasons, we don't disclose the specifics of our promotions. But we have, like I said, taken that learning and applied it. In general, we aim to keep our total marketing spend, which is the combination of advertising, consumer and trade, at about 25% of list sales. But the marketing mix is going to vary depending upon the brand and the category and the competitive set in that category.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Grainger (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just to clarify, I guess with respect to the marketing and selling costs overall for the full year, my sense is that this should definitely be up year-on-year in absolute terms because of this course correction. But can you just confirm that, that's the right way to think about it on a full year basis, not necessarily quarter-to-quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony DiSilvestro (Executives)】\nYes, Denise was referring to our total marketing, so advertising, consumer and trade spending, not the selling and marketing line on the P&L, and trying to keep it around 24% to 25% of list sales. I wouldn't expect any significant changes in those percentages year-on-year, '15 versus '14. Maybe some slight changes within them, but nothing significant.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason English (Analysts)】\nI want to drill down a little bit more on gross margin. I think at least for me, that was the biggest surprise in the quarter. Can you help us quantify the Plum recall expenses, as well as the other supply chain expenses, I guess the mark-to-market charges that ate you this year? And then bigger question, thinking forward into next year, you're guiding for inflation to modestly outstrip productivity, as I think Matt was getting at, pricing, net pricing out of promotions has been eroding into the new fiscal year. And you've had this mix issue within your P&L, presumably, as Soup sales lag in some of your lower margin but faster growth piece of the portfolio becoming a bigger piece. So in context of all that, how do we get comfortable with gross margins being flat in fiscal '15?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony DiSilvestro (Executives)】\nOkay, I can address that because with any planning cycle, there are certainly puts and takes. So I mean, this year, we had the Plum recall that was worth $16 million. As we've discussed in the fourth quarter, we had this issue around losses on open commodity contracts. Both of those are going to turn and go the other way in 2015. But there's been some one-offs or takes in 2015 as well. Most of that Plum recall wrap is going to be offset by unfavorable currency movements at the transaction level. So imports into both Canada and Australia are adversely impacted by the weakening of those currencies. So there's a number of pluses and minuses that kind of net out, with the exception of the incentive compensation headwind. And we've talked about that, it's $45 million. A good portion of that $45 million is going to be offset by the benefit of our restructuring program. We had 3 quarters this year, we've announced restructuring initiatives. Combined, when we fully implement those, it's worth $65 million. We won't get all that in F '15, but we'll get a good portion of that. So we're trying to mitigate that impact. And again, we have a number of puts and takes, and they kind of all balance out, with the exception of that one big one.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason English (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's helpful. Switching gears, Denise, to you, on M&A. You've kind of hinted that maybe M&A is in the cards. But you've put out this $10 billion sales bogey in 5 years and even giving you credit for pretty healthy acceleration of your underlying portfolio, you're going to come easily $1 billion-plus short of that without M&A. So a, is that the right way to think about it? And then b, as we contemplate up to $1 billion or more of acquired sales over the next 5 years, how do we think about your prioritization in terms of buying businesses that accelerate the long-term growth of your portfolio versus buying businesses that can have a meaningful impact on both the top and bottom line right out of the gates?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nYes, well, we continue to evaluate M&A targets that are a good strategic fit, but we have a very disciplined approach. So what I don't want the takeaway to be is that we're going to be reckless about this. We definitely have been looking at specific targets, but we've walked away from more than we made. So the prioritization will be about the places that we've picked, being the Global Baking and Snacking area, the packaged fresh area, health and wellness in North America. Those are 3 areas that we believe that they are our faster-growing spaces for us, based on the strategy that we've laid out. And we do have the financial flexibility to make a meaningful acquisition. But like I said, we're being very disciplined about it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony DiSilvestro (Executives)】\nYes, if I could just add to that, I mean, certainly, M&A can play a role as you've seen us do with Bolthouse and Plum and Kelsen in terms of improving our growth profile. And we'll continue to look for opportunities to do that. But we also recognize that in terms of value creation, the best thing we can do is improve the performance of our base business. And Denise has talked about the dual mandates, where we're focused on expanding into higher growth spaces with innovation in packaged fresh and availability in the international businesses that we do own. So it's that combination of improving the base and expanding through M&A that will get us to that $10 billion target.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Diane Geissler (Analysts)】\nI wanted to ask about Denise's comments about the 4 pillars to accelerate growth, in particular the move into some nontraditional channels. And I'm particularly interested in promo spending has been pretty inefficient, most of your peers have said the same, so, and you even commented about the Millennials not shopping the way their parents do. So I guess my question is really, as promo hasn't really produced the volume lift, can you, first of all, quantify what percentage of your sales is coming from these alternative channels? And then can you talk a little bit about how you will go about getting into, say, C-stores or club? Or maybe you could just give us a few more details on kind of what's behind that comment. And then obviously, those channels are pretty competitive, so just if you could frame that up a little bit, I'd be very interested in hearing that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nYes, well, we have the majority of our business still concentrated largely in grocery and mass merchandiser, which gives us lots of opportunity for expansion in other channels. And we believe that we need to make a concerted effort to do so. We've expanded our sales presence and our programming across multiple channels. We're also paying attention to the e-commerce space with many of our large customers. And so we're doing a better job in terms of tailoring programs. In some of these new spaces though, we're not highly efficient right out of the gate, but we're learning and getting better at it. I think most of the promotional situations that we had though this year were more in our traditional channels. And we were working more with frequency and less depth. And in some categories, like baked snacks and soup, that didn't work as well as we expected it to. So we are course correcting.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony DiSilvestro (Executives)】\nWe have a very significant initiative, again, to the immediate consumption channel, which we've talked about, as we develop our own route-to-market network. At this point, we have over 100 new distributors signed up. That transition is largely complete. We've got over 100,000 doors in terms of coverage. And we expect to see some growth coming from this initiative, probably by the second quarter of fiscal '15.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nYes, and the original focus on that is Beverages for both V8 and Bolthouse Farms. Yes, and I think our estimate for alternate channels, Diane, is about 10%, somewhere in there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Driscoll (Analysts)】\nI wanted just to talk a little bit about the gross margins. I mean, when I look really big picture at Campbell Soup, in more than 10 years of data, Denise, we haven't seen a gross margin like this. I mean, 35.4%, I mean, it's remarkable in respect to what Campbell's has produced for so many years. I also believe that at the beginning of the year, you guys thought that the gross margin would actually be kind of flattish on the year, and it was down 190 basis points. So there's a lot of things that have really happened that I think were not easily predictable by the team. The point, and the question is, can you just discuss why gross margins wouldn't have significant risk to the downside ongoing for the very same factors that kind of drove the F '14 numbers? And is it simply all about this $65 million in savings? Is that the lifeline that we're hoping that really stabilizes gross margins?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony DiSilvestro (Executives)】\nYes, I think the first is we certainly acknowledge what has happened to our gross margin over the last couple of years. And the principal driver of that has been an increasing trade rate. And it has to do with the environment. It has to do with a couple of our businesses, namely U.S. Soup and Australia and more recently, in Pepperidge Farm. And I think the difference -- and certainly, it is a challenging goal. We acknowledge that. But we also acknowledge in order for us to hit our financial targets, we need to do a better job of managing this trade rate closer to flat. We have plans to do that in 2015 with a combination of changes to promote at price points. That's something we didn't have coming into this year, so that obviously has a direct and immediate impact on the amount of trade. We have adjustments to the frequency and around specific promotional events, continuing to learn in terms of what programs are more productive versus less productive, and let's reallocate within the portfolio. I think most of the challenge in Australia is hopefully behind us. We have specific plans to address the issue of late within Pepperidge Farm. So as we look across the portfolio -- and again, it's going to vary by category, but we're looking to hold the trade rate relatively flat. And it is a challenge. But that's our plan and what we're trying to do in 2015, because we know how critical it is to the gross margin to get this trade rate back to flattish.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Driscoll (Analysts)】\nI mean, to state the obvious, it's unsettling to see these gross margins do what they're doing, and then to have confidence in the model. Certainly, '15 will be critical. Can you describe or quantify the size of the commodity impact for the open hedge position that you took in the fourth quarter? If I'm correct, that's a reversible item. So what will happen is that as you actually recognize those, the actual transactions through F '15, what was a headwind in the fourth quarter will become a tailwind within the operating segments as the course of '15 plays through and the hedges are used up?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony DiSilvestro (Executives)】\nYes, somebody studied hedge accounting. It's about $10 million.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Driscoll (Analysts)】\n$10 million. And then I would go back to Eric's question. Just to state it -- I think I want to state it simply, the $45 million of incentive comp that you've built back into the plan, I think what Eric was getting at is kind of why does all $45 million get back into the budget for the year, when the expectation is that the company will not achieve its long-term targets? And so in simple form, and maybe, and it doesn't mean to come across that harsh. I mean, Denise, maybe the right answer is you just have to pay the team in order to keep the team. I think we all just kind of want to understand the philosophy on the $45 million and what it takes to maintain the excitement of the people running the business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony DiSilvestro (Executives)】\nYes, Dave, let me jump in first here, and then Denise can comment if she'd like. Thanks for the second attempt here at an answer. Think about it as 2 parts. There's, again, there's an annual incentive plan which kind of resets each year. And then there's long-term targets that will increase year-on-year, but do not get back to 100% payout. So the annual incentive goes back to target, the long-term one will go up next year, but they don't go anywhere near 100% if they're set against our sales -- our longer-term sales and EPS targets.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Denise Morrison (Executives)】\nYes, we definitely have a pay-for-performance compensation system, with sales goals that are higher than our guidance.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Todd Duvick (Analysts)】\nVery simply on the balance sheet, you had $700 million of debt that matured in August. And I think you had capacity to refinance that with commercial paper. And I guess my question is really twofold. First of all, would you look to refinance a portion of that in the debt capital markets to term out a portion of your floating rate debt? And in terms of capital allocation priorities, do you continue to be focused somewhat on debt reduction for FY '15?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Anthony DiSilvestro (Executives)】\nSo I can take that. In F '14, we had $700 million of long-term debt maturing. We also had cash flow that enabled us to reduce our total debt level by $300 million to $400 million. So one of them has just been paid off with cash from operations, the other, as you point out, refinanced with commercial paper. As you know, we have pretty good access to capital markets, so we're continuing to evaluate opportunities to come to market. We don't have a specific plan to share with you today on that. But again, we're looking at that pretty closely. In terms of capital allocation priorities, not much has changed there. Obviously, our first priority is to fund our ongoing business; the second would be dividends; third, M&A; and the last would be share repurchase. What's changing in F '15 is that we're going to resume in a modest fashion a return to share repurchases, get a little bit of EPS benefit in F '15. But that would be the only change for us going forward.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jennifer Driscoll (Executives)】\nThanks. And thanks, everybody, for hanging on a little extra time there.

Speakers for today's call will be Jim Whitehurst, President and CEO; and Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and CFO.\r\nOur earnings press release was issued after the market closed today and may be downloaded from redhat.com on the Investor Relations page. Also on this page, you will be able to find a historic reconciliation schedule of GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics as well as the schedule on currency rates.\r\nVarious marks that we -- remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans and prospects, including statements containing the words believe, anticipate, plan, project, estimate, expect, intend or will, constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC as well as the Safe Harbor statement in today's press release.\r\nIn addition, any forward-looking statements represent our estimates or views only as of today, September 18, 2014, and these estimates or views may change. While the company may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates or views do change. And therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our estimates or views as of any date subsequent to today.\r\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Tom, and let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call.\r\nWe delivered a strong second quarter as we continue to benefit from our position as a leading software provider enabling the new era of computing. We continue to drive our vision of the open hybrid cloud, and when combined with strong execution in sales, enabled us to exceed our guidance for the second quarter.\r\nSome of the highlights of the second quarter include our fastest subscription revenue growth in 7 quarters, the 10th straight quarter of mid to high teens growth in total revenue and outperformance of the revenue line driven by strong sales execution and focused investment led to non-GAAP operating margins that were 140 basis points higher than our guidance.\r\nWe've had a busy summer as we continue to collaborate with our customers and partners to deliver innovative technologies to the enterprise. One of our top goals with customers is to enable their journey to the open hybrid cloud. We accomplished this through a broad portfolio of technologies, professional services and award-winning customer service. The journey to running applications anywhere any time starts with the core foundation of RHEL and JBoss middleware. As Charlie will discuss in a moment, we saw solid growth in these core technologies.\r\nIn addition, we continue to see traction in our emerging technologies. For example, customers in our early adopter program, which covers all our major verticals, are already using new functionality of Linux Containers, Active Directory and built-in performance profiles in RHEL 7.\r\nLet me now discuss some of our recent technology releases that added new capabilities and functionality to our open hybrid cloud vision. Let me start with RHEL OpenStack Platform 5.0. This is our third enterprise version of OpenStack technology. RHEL OSP 5.0 technology is based on the OpenStack Icehouse release and is tightly integrated with RHEL to provide enhanced performance, reliability and a large certified ecosystem for applications deployed on OpenStack cloud. \r\nThis version also includes several new features aimed at easing enterprise adoption of OpenStack in the existing data center and enhancing capabilities to make it the most reliable and dependable cloud platform. These features include, first, a new 3-year support life cycle provided by Red Hat's global support services team and the world's largest certified OpenStack partner ecosystem; second, support for integrations with VMware infrastructure, encompassing virtualization, management, networking and storage; third, enhanced security for virtual machines, which will now support new cryptographic security requirements for the United States and the United Kingdom; and fourth, improved interoperability of networking stacks. The new architecture provides a path for customers with heterogeneous networking environment who want to use a mix of networking solutions in their OpenStack environment.\r\nAlong with RHEL OSP 5.0, we launched an open virtual appliance for RHEL OSP, which eases the installation process and provides organizations considering OpenStack the ability to experience its power firsthand.  \r\nIn addition, we released the first Red Hat-branded version of our block and object storage solution, Red Hat's Inktank Ceph Enterprise 1.2. This version includes new features to help customers store and manage an entire spectrum of data from hot mission-critical data to cold archival data. The new functionality, coupled with enhancements to the solutions management and monitoring platform, make the Red Hat's Inktank Ceph Enterprise storage solution a flexible and cost-effective storage platform for enterprises managing data-intensive applications, including OpenStack deployments.\r\nWe also continue to invest in the future innovation with the announcement earlier today of the signing of an acquisition agreement for FeedHenry, a Mobile Backend-as-a-Service vendor. Mobile computing is changing the way enterprises conduct business and engage with their employees, partners and customers. It's a rapidly growing segment of IT, and enterprises are looking for solutions that enable them to extend existing applications to mobile devices and to build new applications that embrace mobile users from the beginning.\r\nFeedHenry is an early adopter in cloud-based enterprise mobile applications platforms, has expertise in delivering on mobile applications needs for enterprises. With the completion of the acquisition, Red Hat will be better able to support customers in the end mobile application development, integration and management needs at enterprise scale.\r\nFeedHenry is a natural fit with Red Hat's strengths in Enterprise Middleware and OpenShift Platform-as-a-Service technology. In fact, our OpenShift Online recently achieved the milestone of 2 million applications created on the platform. That's double year-over-year. This combination of application integration technologies will allow our customers to meet their growing mobile requirements.\r\nOn the partner front, we recently announced an expanded strategic partnership with Cisco involving Red Hat's broad portfolio of cloud technologies. Red Hat and Cisco jointly served many large customers with complementary solutions for running new workloads. Accordingly, Cisco is interested in promoting Red Hat's open source-based solutions, Linux, OpenStack, OpenShift, our Middleware storage, Red Hat Cloud Infrastructure and management.\r\nCisco is also the market leader in integrated infrastructure, the fast-growing market segment that combines server, networking, storage and management software. Cisco is rolling out its largest update to their UCS platform, which will include a new UCS bundled solution based on the RHEL OpenStack platform. Part of the thinking for this new family of Cisco UCS solutions was strongly affirmed by Cisco's largest customers. 19 of 20 -- 19 of Cisco's top 20 customers told them that they plan to use OpenStack. Customer demand, our successful history of partnering around RHEL and Red Hat's leading position in OpenStack made Red Hat the logical choice for Cisco to bring these solutions to market.\r\nIn addition to the Cisco announcement, Red Hat and Nokia jointly announced that we will be expanding our work together to enable mobile operators to create a more efficient, flexible, telco cloud infrastructure. The agreement bundles Nokia Networks' carrier-grade virtualized core applications and cloud application management products with Red Hat's Enterprise Linux OpenStack platform.\r\nWith Alcatel-Lucent, Dell and now Nokia, we are building a commercial ecosystem to deliver network function virtualization or NFV technology to the carriers.\r\nIn summary, our global team of Red Hat associates executed well and delivered a strong first half of fiscal 2015. We've enhanced our position with customers, partners and the open source community. We're excited about the second half of the year as we will look to further strengthen and benefit from our leadership position over the long term while we continue to drive enterprise innovation. That innovation also caused Forbes to recently recognize Red Hat as one of the most innovative companies.\r\nBefore turning the call over to Charlie, I want to thank Red Hat associates around the globe for their continued contributions that will enable us to remain at the forefront of driving innovation in our industry.\r\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Charlie.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Jim. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter at Red Hat. Our great team of Red Hat associates generated strong growth in all major geographies, routes to market and across our portfolio of technologies. Our Q2 financial metrics reflect their effort. \r\nLet me share with you some of the highlights from the quarter. First, as background, foreign exchange rates have once again become volatile, especially towards the end of the quarter. The result was fairly minimal impact on our P&L when compared against Q2 last year, last quarter or against guidance since we use an average rate for the quarter. But in contrast, the balance sheet, which is translated using spot rates, at the end of the quarter reflects the near quarter-end weakening of many currencies against the U.S. dollar, including the yen, the euro and the pound. As a result, I will focus on U.S. dollar results and add constant currency equivalents where there was significant change.\r\nWith that, some of the Q2 highlights include: Year-over-year Q2 total revenue grew 19%, which exceeded the high end of our revenue guidance due to a combination of strong demand for subscriptions and services and rapid revenue growth from Red Hat certified public cloud providers, which I'll describe in more detail in a moment; Non-GAAP operating margin was 24.4%, higher than expectations due to the top line outperformance and leverage in our business model; And non-GAAP EPS at $0.41 was up 17% year-over-year and also above guidance.\r\nHere are some additional details that led to these results, starting with a look at the largest deals that closed in the quarter. The large deals are big, and they're continuing to get bigger. First, all of the top 30 deals in Q2 were greater than $1 million, as was the case in Q2 last year. We also had 6 deals that were $5 million or greater, a record for Q2, and one of these deals was greater than $10 million. Cross-selling was good with 70% of these deals, including one or more components from our application development and emerging technologies offerings such as Middleware, OpenStack, OpenShift, CloudForms and Storage. 4 of the top 30 deals were standalone deals comprised solely from offerings from our application development and emerging technologies. The top deals came from a broad range of industries, but the top verticals were government and technology and media. \r\nOn the renewal front, I'm pleased to share that once again, we renewed all of the top 25 deals that were up for renewal. Largely due to a high concentration of federal deals, most of which renewed at 100%, the total value of the top 25 deals expected to renew was approximately 110% of last year's total. I would add that the top 25 commercial customer deals were renewed at greater than 120%, as usual. \r\nIn considering the adoption of our solutions, it's worth also noting that 3 of the top 6 largest deals this quarter, each $5 million or over, were not included in the top renewal metric because they were not large deals prior to this quarter. That's a first.\r\nNow let's turn to our financial performance. On a geographic basis, this quarter produced solid double-digit growth across all of our major geographies. 59% of bookings came from the Americas, 24% from EMEA and 17% from Asia Pacific versus a 60-23-17 percent split in Q2 last year.\r\nQ2 sales route mix was relatively consistent with 69% from the channel and 31% from our direct sales force versus a 70-30 percent split in Q2 last year. As we said before, our long-term annual goal is a 70-30 percent split, but we would expect seasonal quarterly fluctuations over the course of the full fiscal year.\r\nAs I said last quarter, it is my belief that the rolling 4-quarter average billings metric is the appropriate billings metric. A rolling 4-quarter average billings proxy, which we calculate by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the previous 4 quarters, was $465 million, up 20% year-over-year.\r\nNow let's shift to the income statement. Second quarter revenue was $446 million, an increase of 19% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Both subscriptions and services drove this outperformance in revenue, meaningfully exceeding our second quarter revenue guidance. Subscription revenue of $389 million was up 19% year-over-year, and rapid revenue growth coming from the relatively new channel of distribution was one of the contributors to this strong performance. I'm referring to the roughly 80-plus Red Hat-certified public cloud providers that deliver our technologies on demand in their clouds and report usage and revenue to us monthly in arrears. Since our services have already been provided, we recognize revenue from this channel immediately, and there is also no deferred revenue.\r\nA couple of important takeaways from this cloud -- this public cloud revenue. First, we estimate that more than half of this cloud revenue is from small- to medium-sized businesses, many of which are new to Red Hat. Second, this public cloud revenue has grown sequentially every month since we began tracking it and is growing at a faster rate than any other part of the business. While the growth in this channel contributed to our revenue upside in the quarter, it's important to also appreciate that it serves as a headwind to 2 other metrics that we track in the more traditional subscription model. Billings and deferred revenue do not fully reflect the acceleration we have seen in this channel because we are billing 1 month in arrears rather than 1- or 3-year subscriptions billed in advance.\r\nHere is a breakdown of revenue by technology. Subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $332 million, up 16% year-over-year, whilst subscription revenue for application development and emerging technologies offerings was $57 million, up 44% and now approximately 13% of total revenue. As a reminder, our infrastructure-related offerings include mainly RHEL and RHEL-related offerings, while our application development and emerging technology offerings include Middleware, OpenStack, OpenShift, Storage and our new cloud management offerings.\r\nThe training and services component of revenue was $56 million, up 18% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially. This acceleration is due to increased training revenues related to the introduction of RHEL 7 and for OpenStack and increased consulting revenue principally for OpenStack and Middleware.\r\nNow I'll discuss the rest of our results on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation, amortization expense and business acquisition-related costs, starting with gross margin. Subscription gross margin was 93.9%, 20 basis points better than Q1. Training and services gross margin was 33.4%, up 120 basis points from Q1. And overall gross margin was 86.3%, 20 basis points better than Q1 and modestly lower than Q2 last year due to services.\r\nNow moving on to non-GAAP operating expenses. Q2 non-GAAP operating expense came in at $276 million, up 20% year-over-year. R&D grew 22% as we continued hiring engineers for our emerging technologies and added a full quarter of expenses from our acquisitions of Inktank and the OpenStack engineering team from eNovance. We continue to show leverage on the G&A line, which is now 7.6% of revenue, 30 basis points lower than Q2 last year.\r\nQ2 non-GAAP operating income was $109 million, producing an operating margin of 24.4% and well above our guidance. This higher result was due to the outperformance on the revenue line. Net interest and other income was modestly lower than Q2 last year at approximately $2 million.\r\nOur estimated annual effective tax rate was 29% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.41, which is $0.03 above the high end of our guidance range and up 17% year-over-year.\r\nNow let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $1.3 billion after spending $66 million on the cash component of the eNovance acquisition and $80 million to repurchase approximately 1.5 million shares of Red Hat common stock. We have repurchased $160 million in Red Hat shares year-to-date and now have $80 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.\r\nQuarterly operating cash flow was $108 million, while CapEx remained low at $14 million, producing free cash flow of $94 million. Year-to-date, free cash flow is now $250 million, up 18% year-over-year. FX-adjusted days sales outstanding at 60 days continue to be within our target range and up 3 days from Q2 last year. As a reminder, since day sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables compared to billings, our DSO is calculated using our billings proxy.\r\nTotal deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.25 billion, an increase of $192 million or 18% over the same quarter a year ago. Current deferred revenue grew 16%, and long-term deferred revenue grew 26% from 1 year ago. Sequentially, deferred revenue decreased approximately $21 million from last quarter due mainly to the volatility of foreign exchange spot rates, which I discussed earlier. The FX impact on deferred revenue was $15 million of this decrease.\r\nTo isolate the FX impact, let me break down the components of deferred revenue for you. Short-term deferred revenue, which ended Q1 at $947 million, had a real decrease in Q2 of $16 million and decreased $10 million more as a result of changes in currency spot rates, ending Q2 at $921 million. Long-term deferred revenue, which ended Q1 at $325 million, had a real increase in Q2 of approximately $10 million but decreased $5 million as a result of changes in FX spot rates, ending Q2 at $331 million. The total decrease in deferred revenue, without the impact of currency changes, was $6 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows.\r\nNow I'd like to turn to guidance. For purposes of this guidance, I have assumed that average FX rates for Q3 and the balance of the year are as they were recently. For example, the euro was at $1.29 and JPY 107 equals $1. These rates are significantly weaker versus the dollar than the FX rates I used in providing guidance in June, and these rates create a headwind of approximately $15 million to our updated full year revenue guidance being provided today.\r\nI am also incorporating estimates related to the announcement this morning of the acquisition of FeedHenry, which is expected to close within a few weeks. FeedHenry is an early stage, venture-backed company with innovative technology to address the rapidly growing mobile platform market. Although it has immaterial revenue now, in time, we expect this early-stage business to add to our fast-growing emerging technologies efforts. For the remainder of this fiscal year, FeedHenry may add $1 million to revenue, but it will have a dilutive impact on operating margins of 30 basis points and $0.02 to non-GAAP EPS. However, organic growth is strong, and we expect improved performance of our base business to offset the dilution from this acquisition.\r\nWith these assumptions in mind, the new full year revenue guidance is $1.770 billion to $1.785 billion or 16% growth at the top of the range at these assumed currency rates. By raising the bottom of our previous U.S. dollar revenue guidance and maintaining the top end of that range, we have increased the midpoint of our fiscal year revenue guidance by $5 million despite the $15 million incremental foreign exchange headwind that I just noted a moment ago.\r\nIn addition, by maintaining the high end of our revenue guidance, we are effectively raising the constant currency revenue guidance by $15 million at the top of the range. It is our intention to continue to invest in sales and engineering, and therefore, we are maintaining our operating margin guidance at around 23%. Please note, this includes absorbing the dilution from all 3 acquisitions this year.\r\nThe estimated annual effective tax rate remains at 29%, and earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.53 to $1.55, pushing the EPS range higher by $0.01 per share. Our operating cash flow guidance is unchanged at $580 million to $600 million. Free cash flow is expected to show nice improvement this year in percentage terms since CapEx is expected to be in the $50 million range for the full year, down from almost $80 million last year.\r\nFor Q3 specifically, I offer the following outlook. Q3 is estimated to be approximately -- Q3 revenue is estimated to be approximately $449 million to $452 million. This reflects approximately $7 million of foreign exchange headwind from my previous guidance and from all the sell-side models I've seen. Operating margin is estimated to be in the 23% area, and interest and other income should be around $2 million. And non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.40, assuming the same 29% tax rate. Consistent with my past practice, I do not forecast quarterly cash flow.\r\nIn summary, we continue to believe that we are only at the beginning of the open hybrid cloud opportunity, and Red Hat is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this major market opportunity. With focused investment and adept execution, we will increase our position.\r\nOperator, I'd like to turn now back over to you for the first question.",

We continue to drive our vision of the open hybrid cloud, and when combined with strong execution in sales, enabled us to exceed our guidance for the second quarter.\r\nSome of the highlights of the second quarter include our fastest subscription revenue growth in 7 quarters, the 10th straight quarter of mid to high teens growth in total revenue and outperformance of the revenue line driven by strong sales execution and focused investment led to non-GAAP operating margins that were 140 basis points higher than our guidance.\r\nWe've had a busy summer as we continue to collaborate with our customers and partners to deliver innovative technologies to the enterprise. One of our top goals with customers is to enable their journey to the open hybrid cloud. We accomplished this through a broad portfolio of technologies, professional services and award-winning customer service. The journey to running applications anywhere any time starts with the core foundation of RHEL and JBoss middleware. As Charlie will discuss in a moment, we saw solid growth in these core technologies.\r\nIn addition, we continue to see traction in our emerging technologies. For example, customers in our early adopter program, which covers all our major verticals, are already using new functionality of Linux Containers, Active Directory and built-in performance profiles in RHEL 7.\r\nLet me now discuss some of our recent technology releases that added new capabilities and functionality to our open hybrid cloud vision. Let me start with RHEL OpenStack Platform 5.0. This is our third enterprise version of OpenStack technology. RHEL OSP 5.0 technology is based on the OpenStack Icehouse release and is tightly integrated with RHEL to provide enhanced performance, reliability and a large certified ecosystem for applications deployed on OpenStack cloud. \r\nThis version also includes several new features aimed at easing enterprise adoption of OpenStack in the existing data center and enhancing capabilities to make it the most reliable and dependable cloud platform. These features include, first, a new 3-year support life cycle provided by Red Hat's global support services team and the world's largest certified OpenStack partner ecosystem; second, support for integrations with VMware infrastructure, encompassing virtualization, management, networking and storage; third, enhanced security for virtual machines, which will now support new cryptographic security requirements for the United States and the United Kingdom; and fourth, improved interoperability of networking stacks. The new architecture provides a path for customers with heterogeneous networking environment who want to use a mix of networking solutions in their OpenStack environment.\r\nAlong with RHEL OSP 5.0, we launched an open virtual appliance for RHEL OSP, which eases the installation process and provides organizations considering OpenStack the ability to experience its power firsthand.  \r\nIn addition, we released the first Red Hat-branded version of our block and object storage solution, Red Hat's Inktank Ceph Enterprise 1.2. This version includes new features to help customers store and manage an entire spectrum of data from hot mission-critical data to cold archival data. The new functionality, coupled with enhancements to the solutions management and monitoring platform, make the Red Hat's Inktank Ceph Enterprise storage solution a flexible and cost-effective storage platform for enterprises managing data-intensive applications, including OpenStack deployments.\r\nWe also continue to invest in the future innovation with the announcement earlier today of the signing of an acquisition agreement for FeedHenry, a Mobile Backend-as-a-Service vendor. Mobile computing is changing the way enterprises conduct business and engage with their employees, partners and customers. It's a rapidly growing segment of IT, and enterprises are looking for solutions that enable them to extend existing applications to mobile devices and to build new applications that embrace mobile users from the beginning.\r\nFeedHenry is an early adopter in cloud-based enterprise mobile applications platforms, has expertise in delivering on mobile applications needs for enterprises. With the completion of the acquisition, Red Hat will be better able to support customers in the end mobile application development, integration and management needs at enterprise scale.\r\nFeedHenry is a natural fit with Red Hat's strengths in Enterprise Middleware and OpenShift Platform-as-a-Service technology. In fact, our OpenShift Online recently achieved the milestone of 2 million applications created on the platform. That's double year-over-year. This combination of application integration technologies will allow our customers to meet their growing mobile requirements.\r\nOn the partner front, we recently announced an expanded strategic partnership with Cisco involving Red Hat's broad portfolio of cloud technologies. Red Hat and Cisco jointly served many large customers with complementary solutions for running new workloads. Accordingly, Cisco is interested in promoting Red Hat's open source-based solutions, Linux, OpenStack, OpenShift, our Middleware storage, Red Hat Cloud Infrastructure and management.\r\nCisco is also the market leader in integrated infrastructure, the fast-growing market segment that combines server, networking, storage and management software. Cisco is rolling out its largest update to their UCS platform, which will include a new UCS bundled solution based on the RHEL OpenStack platform. Part of the thinking for this new family of Cisco UCS solutions was strongly affirmed by Cisco's largest customers. 19 of 20 -- 19 of Cisco's top 20 customers told them that they plan to use OpenStack. Customer demand, our successful history of partnering around RHEL and Red Hat's leading position in OpenStack made Red Hat the logical choice for Cisco to bring these solutions to market.\r\nIn addition to the Cisco announcement, Red Hat and Nokia jointly announced that we will be expanding our work together to enable mobile operators to create a more efficient, flexible, telco cloud infrastructure. The agreement bundles Nokia Networks' carrier-grade virtualized core applications and cloud application management products with Red Hat's Enterprise Linux OpenStack platform.\r\nWith Alcatel-Lucent, Dell and now Nokia, we are building a commercial ecosystem to deliver network function virtualization or NFV technology to the carriers.\r\nIn summary, our global team of Red Hat associates executed well and delivered a strong first half of fiscal 2015. We've enhanced our position with customers, partners and the open source community. We're excited about the second half of the year as we will look to further strengthen and benefit from our leadership position over the long term while we continue to drive enterprise innovation. That innovation also caused Forbes to recently recognize Red Hat as one of the most innovative companies.\r\nBefore turning the call over to Charlie, I want to thank Red Hat associates around the globe for their continued contributions that will enable us to remain at the forefront of driving innovation in our industry.\r\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Charlie.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nThanks, Jim. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter at Red Hat. Our great team of Red Hat associates generated strong growth in all major geographies, routes to market and across our portfolio of technologies. Our Q2 financial metrics reflect their effort. \r\nLet me share with you some of the highlights from the quarter. First, as background, foreign exchange rates have once again become volatile, especially towards the end of the quarter. The result was fairly minimal impact on our P&L when compared against Q2 last year, last quarter or against guidance since we use an average rate for the quarter. But in contrast, the balance sheet, which is translated using spot rates, at the end of the quarter reflects the near quarter-end weakening of many currencies against the U.S. dollar, including the yen, the euro and the pound. As a result, I will focus on U.S. dollar results and add constant currency equivalents where there was significant change.\r\nWith that, some of the Q2 highlights include: Year-over-year Q2 total revenue grew 19%, which exceeded the high end of our revenue guidance due to a combination of strong demand for subscriptions and services and rapid revenue growth from Red Hat certified public cloud providers, which I'll describe in more detail in a moment; Non-GAAP operating margin was 24.4%, higher than expectations due to the top line outperformance and leverage in our business model; And non-GAAP EPS at $0.41 was up 17% year-over-year and also above guidance.\r\nHere are some additional details that led to these results, starting with a look at the largest deals that closed in the quarter. The large deals are big, and they're continuing to get bigger. First, all of the top 30 deals in Q2 were greater than $1 million, as was the case in Q2 last year. We also had 6 deals that were $5 million or greater, a record for Q2, and one of these deals was greater than $10 million. Cross-selling was good with 70% of these deals, including one or more components from our application development and emerging technologies offerings such as Middleware, OpenStack, OpenShift, CloudForms and Storage. 4 of the top 30 deals were standalone deals comprised solely from offerings from our application development and emerging technologies. The top deals came from a broad range of industries, but the top verticals were government and technology and media. \r\nOn the renewal front, I'm pleased to share that once again, we renewed all of the top 25 deals that were up for renewal. Largely due to a high concentration of federal deals, most of which renewed at 100%, the total value of the top 25 deals expected to renew was approximately 110% of last year's total. I would add that the top 25 commercial customer deals were renewed at greater than 120%, as usual. \r\nIn considering the adoption of our solutions, it's worth also noting that 3 of the top 6 largest deals this quarter, each $5 million or over, were not included in the top renewal metric because they were not large deals prior to this quarter. That's a first.\r\nNow let's turn to our financial performance. On a geographic basis, this quarter produced solid double-digit growth across all of our major geographies. 59% of bookings came from the Americas, 24% from EMEA and 17% from Asia Pacific versus a 60-23-17 percent split in Q2 last year.\r\nQ2 sales route mix was relatively consistent with 69% from the channel and 31% from our direct sales force versus a 70-30 percent split in Q2 last year. As we said before, our long-term annual goal is a 70-30 percent split, but we would expect seasonal quarterly fluctuations over the course of the full fiscal year.\r\nAs I said last quarter, it is my belief that the rolling 4-quarter average billings metric is the appropriate billings metric. A rolling 4-quarter average billings proxy, which we calculate by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the previous 4 quarters, was $465 million, up 20% year-over-year.\r\nNow let's shift to the income statement. Second quarter revenue was $446 million, an increase of 19% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Both subscriptions and services drove this outperformance in revenue, meaningfully exceeding our second quarter revenue guidance. Subscription revenue of $389 million was up 19% year-over-year, and rapid revenue growth coming from the relatively new channel of distribution was one of the contributors to this strong performance. I'm referring to the roughly 80-plus Red Hat-certified public cloud providers that deliver our technologies on demand in their clouds and report usage and revenue to us monthly in arrears. Since our services have already been provided, we recognize revenue from this channel immediately, and there is also no deferred revenue.\r\nA couple of important takeaways from this cloud -- this public cloud revenue. First, we estimate that more than half of this cloud revenue is from small- to medium-sized businesses, many of which are new to Red Hat. Second, this public cloud revenue has grown sequentially every month since we began tracking it and is growing at a faster rate than any other part of the business. While the growth in this channel contributed to our revenue upside in the quarter, it's important to also appreciate that it serves as a headwind to 2 other metrics that we track in the more traditional subscription model. Billings and deferred revenue do not fully reflect the acceleration we have seen in this channel because we are billing 1 month in arrears rather than 1- or 3-year subscriptions billed in advance.\r\nHere is a breakdown of revenue by technology. Subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $332 million, up 16% year-over-year, whilst subscription revenue for application development and emerging technologies offerings was $57 million, up 44% and now approximately 13% of total revenue. As a reminder, our infrastructure-related offerings include mainly RHEL and RHEL-related offerings, while our application development and emerging technology offerings include Middleware, OpenStack, OpenShift, Storage and our new cloud management offerings.\r\nThe training and services component of revenue was $56 million, up 18% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially. This acceleration is due to increased training revenues related to the introduction of RHEL 7 and for OpenStack and increased consulting revenue principally for OpenStack and Middleware.\r\nNow I'll discuss the rest of our results on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation, amortization expense and business acquisition-related costs, starting with gross margin. Subscription gross margin was 93.9%, 20 basis points better than Q1. Training and services gross margin was 33.4%, up 120 basis points from Q1. And overall gross margin was 86.3%, 20 basis points better than Q1 and modestly lower than Q2 last year due to services.\r\nNow moving on to non-GAAP operating expenses. Q2 non-GAAP operating expense came in at $276 million, up 20% year-over-year. R&D grew 22% as we continued hiring engineers for our emerging technologies and added a full quarter of expenses from our acquisitions of Inktank and the OpenStack engineering team from eNovance. We continue to show leverage on the G&A line, which is now 7.6% of revenue, 30 basis points lower than Q2 last year.\r\nQ2 non-GAAP operating income was $109 million, producing an operating margin of 24.4% and well above our guidance. This higher result was due to the outperformance on the revenue line. Net interest and other income was modestly lower than Q2 last year at approximately $2 million.\r\nOur estimated annual effective tax rate was 29% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.41, which is $0.03 above the high end of our guidance range and up 17% year-over-year.\r\nNow let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $1.3 billion after spending $66 million on the cash component of the eNovance acquisition and $80 million to repurchase approximately 1.5 million shares of Red Hat common stock. We have repurchased $160 million in Red Hat shares year-to-date and now have $80 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.\r\nQuarterly operating cash flow was $108 million, while CapEx remained low at $14 million, producing free cash flow of $94 million. Year-to-date, free cash flow is now $250 million, up 18% year-over-year. FX-adjusted days sales outstanding at 60 days continue to be within our target range and up 3 days from Q2 last year. As a reminder, since day sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables compared to billings, our DSO is calculated using our billings proxy.\r\nTotal deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.25 billion, an increase of $192 million or 18% over the same quarter a year ago. Current deferred revenue grew 16%, and long-term deferred revenue grew 26% from 1 year ago. Sequentially, deferred revenue decreased approximately $21 million from last quarter due mainly to the volatility of foreign exchange spot rates, which I discussed earlier. The FX impact on deferred revenue was $15 million of this decrease.\r\nTo isolate the FX impact, let me break down the components of deferred revenue for you. Short-term deferred revenue, which ended Q1 at $947 million, had a real decrease in Q2 of $16 million and decreased $10 million more as a result of changes in currency spot rates, ending Q2 at $921 million. Long-term deferred revenue, which ended Q1 at $325 million, had a real increase in Q2 of approximately $10 million but decreased $5 million as a result of changes in FX spot rates, ending Q2 at $331 million. The total decrease in deferred revenue, without the impact of currency changes, was $6 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows.\r\nNow I'd like to turn to guidance. For purposes of this guidance, I have assumed that average FX rates for Q3 and the balance of the year are as they were recently. For example, the euro was at $1.29 and JPY 107 equals $1. These rates are significantly weaker versus the dollar than the FX rates I used in providing guidance in June, and these rates create a headwind of approximately $15 million to our updated full year revenue guidance being provided today.\r\nI am also incorporating estimates related to the announcement this morning of the acquisition of FeedHenry, which is expected to close within a few weeks. FeedHenry is an early stage, venture-backed company with innovative technology to address the rapidly growing mobile platform market. Although it has immaterial revenue now, in time, we expect this early-stage business to add to our fast-growing emerging technologies efforts. For the remainder of this fiscal year, FeedHenry may add $1 million to revenue, but it will have a dilutive impact on operating margins of 30 basis points and $0.02 to non-GAAP EPS. However, organic growth is strong, and we expect improved performance of our base business to offset the dilution from this acquisition.\r\nWith these assumptions in mind, the new full year revenue guidance is $1.770 billion to $1.785 billion or 16% growth at the top of the range at these assumed currency rates. By raising the bottom of our previous U.S. dollar revenue guidance and maintaining the top end of that range, we have increased the midpoint of our fiscal year revenue guidance by $5 million despite the $15 million incremental foreign exchange headwind that I just noted a moment ago.\r\nIn addition, by maintaining the high end of our revenue guidance, we are effectively raising the constant currency revenue guidance by $15 million at the top of the range. It is our intention to continue to invest in sales and engineering, and therefore, we are maintaining our operating margin guidance at around 23%. Please note, this includes absorbing the dilution from all 3 acquisitions this year.\r\nThe estimated annual effective tax rate remains at 29%, and earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.53 to $1.55, pushing the EPS range higher by $0.01 per share. Our operating cash flow guidance is unchanged at $580 million to $600 million. Free cash flow is expected to show nice improvement this year in percentage terms since CapEx is expected to be in the $50 million range for the full year, down from almost $80 million last year.\r\nFor Q3 specifically, I offer the following outlook. Q3 is estimated to be approximately -- Q3 revenue is estimated to be approximately $449 million to $452 million. This reflects approximately $7 million of foreign exchange headwind from my previous guidance and from all the sell-side models I've seen. Operating margin is estimated to be in the 23% area, and interest and other income should be around $2 million. And non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be approximately $0.40, assuming the same 29% tax rate. Consistent with my past practice, I do not forecast quarterly cash flow.\r\nIn summary, we continue to believe that we are only at the beginning of the open hybrid cloud opportunity, and Red Hat is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this major market opportunity. With focused investment and adept execution, we will increase our position.\r\nOperator, I'd like to turn now back over to you for the first question.",
      "transcript_text3": "I just wanted to ask about the growth opportunity in your core Linux market. You talked about in the past that there's still opportunity left in the UNIX to Linux migration and then share gain from Windows. I just wanted to find out more on the new workload side given that now RHEL 7 have features to drive some of these newer-type workload. I was wondering, how is this RHEL 7 going to help drive that opportunity? And also, with this upcoming release of Grantley from Intel, which will probably drive more server refresh, how much of that will be tailwind for your RHEL business?\n\n---\n\nWell, we feel really good about RHEL 7. It's one of our largest releases in terms of new features and ease of use that we've ever had. Our RHEL business continues to grow solidly in the mid-double digits. I was just out talking to customers this week. There's still substantial opportunity in UNIX to Linux. We have a lot of interest in Windows to Linux. But as you rightly say, new workload, particularly ones that are targeted to cloud, run on Linux. And so I think we win a disproportionate share of net new workload. So we still see continued growth there far off into the future.\n\n---\n\nAnd any thoughts on Grantley?\n\n---\n\nGrantley, again, whenever we get improvements in price performance, that is another reason for people to look to drive workloads. And so we certainly think it will help. We haven't quantified the degree of help, but each time there's a new chip generation out, it does help provide a bit of a tailwind for us.\n\n---\n\nClearly you guys are seeing the benefit of the cross-sell of emerging products, 70% this quarter in top deals. I'm curious, how much of that can be attributed to the RHEL 7 cycle here? And could we see that accelerate here as you guys start layering on these new products like Storage into the existing base?\n\n---\n\nWell, I doubt you'd see much out of RHEL 7 at this point. While we have people early interest in using, until you get the dot-1 [ph] release, you don't really see people putting it in production. So most of the large deals, it's still RHEL 6 related. I do think that there's more than usual interest in RHEL 7 because of its support of containers with cgroups and other performance improvements to optimize it for cloud. So I do think we'll see that, but I think the strength you're seeing now is frankly a payoff of our last 18 months of investments in our new products, which are starting to show, obviously, a lot better traction.\n\n---\n\nAnd Matt, I'd add one other thing. Probably what's quite interesting, of the top 30 deals, once we had a very good cross-line, what was more impressive is that 9 of those top deals actually took between 5 and 10 different technologies. So it wasn't just them buying RHEL and one other thing. It was a broad portfolio in 9 of the top 30 deals.\n\n---\n\nIt's actually Taz on behalf of Karl. I have a question on your sales and marketing line this quarter. It actually went down sequentially. Can you give more color on that, please?\n\n---\n\nYes. Just to clarify, in the first quarter, we had the Red Hat Summit, which is a large event that we run. And we also had the OpenStack Summit, and we had a number of sales kickoffs. So I -- we had actually expected it to be flat to down for the quarter. So it performed as expected, but it was really the timing of major events that happened in the first quarter that weren't repeated in the second quarter.\n\n---\n\nI had a question about RHEL 7. And just knowing that customers who are obviously paying maintenance will get that version, how do you think about it from the new capabilities that it might offer that might drive people to add on more products, like Charlie was just mentioning, or the ability maybe to move to higher-end SKUs? I'm just trying to get a sense of how fast you think the new capabilities you're delivering will kind of be absorbed into the market and then potentially help accelerate things on the billing side as we look to next year.\n\n---\n\nWell, I think that the single feature that I hear about the most are -- is around containers, right? There's tremendous interest around containers. It's just a new way to build, deploy, manage applications. And I'm hearing that from the most staid European banks, right? It's not just on the West Coast of the U.S. Across the board, people are really looking at containers. And where that starts to drive things, as soon as you start saying containers, you start saying, \"Well, What kind of infrastructure do I need? How do I manage those?\" And that immediately starts bringing in the rest of our portfolio and we're having discussions around OpenShift, OpenStack. So -- and we have a lot of credibility around containers because all the work we've done in cgroups and other areas within Linux to build the foundation for containers opens up just a large strategic conversation with our customers. And that really just help the drive the whole portfolio. So again, we'll see how this develops. I will say I think we've all been surprised at how fast containers have really, I want to say, kind of hit the mainstream in terms of discussion, and therefore, it really does help drive the portfolio. How that actually drives an acceleration next year, that's a little early to say. But I will say, at least in my conversations at the CIO level, RHEL 7 has done more than any prior release to drive more strategic conversation.\n\n---\n\nThis is Matt Lemenager on for Steve. Question around OpenStack. And you acquired eNovance and you did this to get engineers. Are you taking any other steps to develop or acquire OpenStack engineering talent?\n\n---\n\nWell, let me start off. Yes, we got some OpenStack engineers. We got 3 things. So they were one of the 10 largest contributors to OpenStack, and so we got those. But they also have really good capabilities in deploying and managing OpenStack environment. So we thought that was a key skill set to bring in house as well as some technology around that. And finally, it really helps fill out our consulting capability, particularly in Europe. We're more than sold out in terms of our capability to deliver professional services to help our customers implement OpenStack. And this is a way to bring a number of people to bear. So there are really 3 reasons that all worked together in why eNovance makes sense. We'd certainly look for other ways to continue to augment -- just to try to catch up with demand that we're seeing to augment our skill set. So that's really the 3 reasons for eNovance.\n\n---\n\nAnd I would add to that in terms of your second part of the question was, looking for other engineering skills for OpenStack. We're looking for great OpenStack engineers all over the world. We've got our own training programs internally. We've got OpenStack training programs that we're offering through our own external training and certification program. And we're actively recruiting where we can find good talent.\n\n---\n\nIf you know somebody [ph], let us know.\n\n---\n\nQuestions on billings, and I know you're focusing on the trailing. But if I try to look at the short-term billings, as you break that out for us in terms of the constant currency deferred, it looks like it grew slower than long term and then billings overall. So I'm wondering what drove that and whether or not that's related to this shift towards cloud Linux sales and if that means we'll be seeing billings growth rates trail revenue growth rates on a full year basis.\n\n---\n\nI think -- so Michael, I told you -- the last time I saw you I told you I wasn't ever going to talk about the current year billings because I do think trailing 4 quarters is the right metric. But your question is relevant given my comments about the cloud business. And I do think the cloud business is growing very rapidly. It changes the dynamics somewhat as I said. It has a very positive impact on revenues, bringing a lot of new customers to Red Hat. But it's not the same 1-year-in-advance or 3-year-in-advance subscription that we've seen through other channels. So it does have, as I said, a headwind effect or a dampening effect on billings, deferred revenue and probably ultimately operating cash flow until such time as the cloud growth is at the same pace as the rest of the business. So part of the impact that you're talking about certainly came from the public cloud. We view it as a net positive, but I think it does -- it's going to cause a rethink of some of the metrics. And it could well be that the most appropriate metric to gauge our growth is simply revenue, and we'll give more thought to that, and I'm sure we'll talk about it as the quarter progresses.\n\n---\n\nAnd anything in the short-term versus long-term mix. It seemed to be not as good on short term, better on long term this quarter.\n\n---\n\nWell, so some -- obviously, on the cloud, there is -- there's no deferred revenue at all. But on some of the large deals, some of the very large deals we did, those are multiyear deals. And some of those still do pay 3 years upfront, which is why you see the growth in the long-term deferred revenue.\n\n---\n\nJim, wondering if you could just talk about your expectations from Atomic Host, the container-based optimized lightweight OS, as well as when that might be generally available. And then just a quick one for Charlie, I think you mentioned that federal renewals came in at about 100%. I'm just kind of wondering if that's typical historically speaking?\n\n---\n\nYes. So well, I'll start on the Atomic Host. A lot of interest not only from developers but from some cloud providers. So we have a number of discussions going on around the technology. I mean, when you start looking at the best way to run containers, we think it's the best way out there not only because it's a tailored operating system for running containers. It has all the benefits and certifications and the other benefits associated with RHEL. So a lot of interest there. Obviously, we don't talk about GA dates in advance, but we do think it can be a driver for us going forward not just as a product but as part of a portfolio of solutions to best run containers in a true production environment. So a key part of the strategy going forward.\n\n---\n\nOn the second part of the question about the renewal, in the period of time we've been tracking this metric, it probably goes back 6 or 7 years now, I think, the lowest we've seen is 103%. We've had a couple of quarters around 105%. We've had a couple of quarters as high as 130%. And generally, the course have been around 120% uplift. The difference this quarter was the preponderance of government deals in there. And what's different with government is many times we're measuring deals, many times the deal has to do with the program. And when the government buys for a program, they typically buy the whole thing. They run the program, and there's no need for -- to go bigger than that. So I don't believe that this is a trend. I think it's a onetime thing. And as I said, there was a couple of other things which were pretty interesting. The top 25 commercial deals still were over 120%. The second thing, I think, that's even more important is 3 of the top 6 deals were not even on the radar because they weren't large deals at the last time we did something with those customers. But to get something to go to 5 -- over $5 million is, in our model, is fairly unique. It's new for us, but it's a good thing.\n\n---\n\nI was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about sort of the OpenStack ecosystem and the competitive environment. Is it like -- we've seen a lot of action in VMware, now seeing support for OpenStack, Cisco buying Metacloud, HP buying Eucalyptus. Any of these particularly impactful to you in sort of the Red Hat strategy on a going-forward basis? And how are you looking at that ecosystem evolving?\n\n---\n\nSure. Well, first off, I think it's great, right? It just raises demand for OpenStack. More established players talking about it more and supporting it just makes it a more incredible solution. So I think it's great to have people like VMware announcing support. So all of that's great. In terms of the ecosystem, if you mean by kind of competitive landscape, we are still the only kind of player that's running our model, i.e., the enterprise model where we certify -- we have a vision -- the version that's hardened and then we build downstream ecosystem, right? So certainly, people like HP have a strategy where it's tied to their other products and services and their consulting firms out there who do it as well. But in terms of a hardened version with a built ecosystem, we've obviously been very successful doing that in other categories. And we're still the only player doing it this way. It's a little bit ironic, the first management tool vendor to certify the Red Hat OpenStack was HP. So we do believe that we go to customers, they like the fact that they can work with all of their existing vendors and all of their existing customers work with Red Hat's OpenStack. So I love the validation of others involved, and I also am very happy that no one else is trying to compete with Red Hat in our business model, which is proven and has worked well in other categories.\n\n---\n\nYou might want to mention Cisco.\n\n---\n\nCisco's been a great relationship. We continue to do more work with them jointly at customers. They've obviously announced partnerships in a lot of areas. We think them continuing to get more involved, whether it's the acquisition of Metacloud or some of the other things that we announced in the OpenStack appliances, are all, again, good validation of OpenStack as well as a great opportunity to go to market together.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And if I can sneak in one for Charlie. You mentioned the acceleration of the cloud part in the revenues, the ones that you bill -- I'm sorry, you book all upfront having negative impacts on both billings and operating cash flow. Yet you left full year operating cash flow targets in place. Should I take that as an indication that you feel better about sort of -- even -- it's almost like an underlying slight raise, if you will, because of that built in cloud? Or was that already built into your thinking at the beginning of the year?\n\n---\n\nNo. I mean, just to make it clear to everyone, in my view, what I did today was to raise our guidance in constant currency terms. We took the revenue guidance up at the top end of the range by $15 million. We raised the earnings per share guidance by $.0.01. And by keeping the cash flow guidance where it is, basically what it says is, in my belief, the organic growth of the -- for the base business x the cloud part of it is going to offset any headwind that comes from the cloud. So I think that a way to read it is we've raised guidance.\n\n---\n\nCharlie, just on the cloud business again, can you talk a little bit about the products that are being taken up as part of that? Is that mainly having a benefit -- beneficial impact on the infrastructure products? Or are you seeing some of the emerging products go through some of your cloud partners as well? And then just one follow-up that's related. Obviously, you don't have as much visibility in that revenue as you do with the rest of your revenues. So I'm wondering how that's actually impacted your sort of thought process around guidance because we've obviously seen subscription in the last 2 quarters really outperform, and yet you kept the total of your guidance even with FX headwinds. So I'm just trying to get a sense on how you're thinking about that from a guidance perspective as well?\n\n---\n\nYes. I'll start with the beginning. It's virtually all RHEL, and it's not that we don't think our other products can sell well. But we are still working with the major cloud providers to offer our other products. So the primary product that's available generally across is RHEL, right? We continue to work out the appropriate business models for the Middleware portfolio. We obviously have them on OpenShift, so our online product. But we continue to work through the appropriate pricing, update schemes, everything else on the other products. So the only product that's generally available across cloud providers is RHEL. So virtually all of that revenue we're discussing right now is RHEL. I do believe there's a real opportunity with the other products as well.\n\n---\n\nJust in terms of guidance, I'll just say again, we have effectively raised the constant currency guidance by $15 million. That $15 million headwind is something that I think all of you will have to adjust in your models because obviously, it's new news. The currency rates really started moving pretty dramatically in the last part of August, and they're still moving. But at the assumed rates that I'm using, it's a $15 million headwind. And I've kept the top of my range unchanged, which means I've raised the constant currency guidance by $15 million. Now the other part of your question in terms of how we forecast the cloud and how that might affect the guidance I give, we have 80-plus cloud providers. So there's a reasonable diversification among the providers. The other piece of information I shared is that every month since we've been tracking this, this number has been sequentially higher month-to-month. And so it does not have the same visibility as a 1-year subscription where you know exactly what it is and you can watch it day to day and come out of deferred revenue. But it is consistent [ph]. So I think in terms of my comfort with my guidance, I feel comfortable with what we've provided.\n\n---\n\nThis is Fatima Boolani on half of Brent Thill. I was wondering if you could touch on the technical interplay of the Gluster and Inktank and what that sales notion in the conversation with the customers is like on these storage solutions.\n\n---\n\nSure. Well, first off, let me be clear. It's early days in that we only had a quarter of Inktank under our belt. Right now, they're very complimentary. In terms of GA products, Ceph offers block and object store. Gluster offers file store. So they really solve different use cases. And so today, the go-to-market motion is whatever you need, we got it to some extent because we now cover all 3 storage use cases. And so the go-to-market motion is pretty simple that way. Again, we're 1 quarter in on the Inktank side with the Ceph technologies in. So far, they're performing quite well, I think above our expectations, but obviously, in a short amount of time. As we go forward, we'll continue to hone those use cases as we see kind of what works best.\n\n---\n\nJust another follow-up on the cloud business that you've been talking about here for several quarters. Charlie, I'm wondering -- just kind of a 2-part question on your end. Was there any sort of change or shifting of the type of that business that's caused it to have the revenue impact that you're seeing this quarter? And then just kind of quick one for Jim on the same subject. Is this the -- I don't know, you're probably not going to name, names. But are these sort of the larger Amazon-like cloud providers? Are these specialized industry vertical types? I'd love to hear some color on where you're seeing the strengths, particularly in that business, from what types of providers?\n\n---\n\nYes. So the first part of the question just on the numbers, I mean, the growth rate has accelerated. That's really the only change. And the number of cloud providers that are now Red Hat certified has grown as well. I think when we talked at Analyst Day, I think we were talking about in the number of 50 or thereabouts, and it's now over 80. So all of the big names that you could think of are included in that number, and there's a lot of smaller names as well. But it's a very broad group of public cloud providers not just in the U.S. now. This is global.\n\n---\n\nThe only other comment I would say is it's generally the large cloud providers, the specialists, so say what IBM is doing with soft layer or those type of things, we have a lot of use on those. But those are generally part of existing enterprise agreements where they can bring their own subscription to other clouds. So a specialized cloud provider is more likely to be working with a large enterprise. They'll bring their own subscription, and that shows up in our regular subscription. So this is the big names that you would normally think about as general public cloud providers.\n\n---\n\nJust continuing on the cloud thing. How many of these 80-plus providers are fully ramped up? Or is there still room for them to improve their output? Also, what's your road map to expand the channel? And lastly, what are the things that give you comfort that this revenue is not cannibalistic to your core business or won't be cannibalistic down the road?\n\n---\n\nSo the first part of the question about is there growth, in my view, there's definitely room for growth through the public clouds. I just look at some of the names there. Some of the really big clouds are just getting started. And so there's -- in my view, there's clearly room for growth. The second part of the question about whether it is cannibalistic or not, is there a trade-off? We have had some data, which we've seen from one of our large cloud providers, that basically provided the confidence for me to say that we think more than 50% of this business thus far, at least, has been from small- and medium-sized businesses, many of whom have never before been Red Hat customers. So there's a large percentage of new business here. We also have the Cloud Access program, which Jim was referring to. That's the existing Red Hat customers that have a fully paid subscription in the Cloud Access program. They are allowed to move that subscription from their own data center onto a public cloud. Now that, as Jim said, that would not be accounted for in the number I'm using because they've already paid us for the subscription. But there's another form of usage in the public cloud. And I think there's still plenty of room for growth with these cloud providers.\n\n---\n\nAnd really quickly, did you disclose the average deal length? As deal sizes are getting bigger, is there any change in duration or is that mainly more products?\n\n---\n\nI did not disclose it, but it's 21 months. So it's been pretty consistent now at 21 months for quite a long time, average deal length.\n\n---\n\nI thought I'd ask a question on the Middleware side. You guys clearly have -- you have a big JBoss installed base. I'm curious if there's still a large percentage on older versions and what you may be doing to kind of push more upgrade to drive more upselling with the broader portfolio you have today.\n\n---\n\nWell, first off, just a reminder on our business model, we sell a subscription to a product, not to specific versions. So if someone has a subscription, they can use whichever version they choose. But I do think you bring up a good point where JBoss, there is still a substantial amount of free JBoss out there. And one of our core go-to-markets on JBoss is going out and explaining why I paid subscription with updates and support and all the things that go along with that is a good business. So there are really 3 main go-to-markets on JBoss. One is the Free to Pay. We have a substantial business of WebSphere and WebLogic to JBoss replacements. And then thirdly and probably most importantly, a lot of companies are standardizing. So all their new application development happens on JBoss. And that's probably the single largest of the 3. But they're all reasonable drivers of growth in Middleware.\n\n---\n\nAnother cloud question. I think I heard from comments a moment ago that about 50% of the business is from customers you did not have a relationship with previously. How would you say that skews as far as the value of those deals? I mean, I would anticipate that most large companies already have relationships. So this is -- those 50% of people that are new are probably on the lower end of the scale for dollar volume and subscription size, correct?\n\n---\n\nWell, in the value of the deals that are in the cloud, they're probably representative of a large portion of what's actually in the cloud. Comparing their volume in the cloud, however, to some of our larger deals like the $5 million and $10 million deals that we've done -- talked about this quarter, they're not -- definitely not in the same ballpark. I like to think about it as you planting seeds over time, we -- almost every one of our customers started in a very small way with a few subscriptions. And over time, they've grown now to $5 million and $10 million types of transactions. The 3 I talked about before that moved to something over $5 million this quarter from not a large deal last time is interesting, and it's unusual, and we simply hope that keeps going. But most deals -- most customers will just progress over time, and we think these small deals will do the same.\n\n---\n\nJust to clarify, that 50% is 50% of dollars, not 50% of customers that Charlie was referring to that are new to Red Hat.\n\n---\n\nMaybe I should -- thank you for that color. Maybe I should ask the question differently. When you look at the landscape of customers that you have going through your certified public cloud business, does it skew towards Fortune 2000? Or is there a pretty even distribution between large enterprises and smaller enterprises? Maybe some color on that.\n\n---\n\nFrankly, it's hard to know exactly because we don't necessarily get the end-user customer data for all of it. From what we can tell, it certainly skews substantially smaller, right? This is -- the certified cloud provider recognizes the Cloud Access. Larger customers in that subscriptions can also run those on cloud. That's a different component of revenue that shows up in traditional RHEL, right? These are people who are giving their credit card or doing a different payment, which is why I think it heavily skews to new users.\n\n---\n\nJust 2 quick ones. On the cloud service providers, are most of those deals in U.S. dollar? As that continues to grow, could we see a little bit of a dampening effect from the currency swings we see on the deferred revenues -- or in revenues overall, I should say?\n\n---\n\nFrom a dollar perspective, I think it's safe to say that the majority of the business is done in U.S. dollars, that's true, yes. And I think your second comment is actually what I was trying to say, is the business model is a little bit different. We've got the revenue is recognized in arrears. So there is no billing for 1 year in advance or 3 year in advance, the longer subscriptions that we would normally do. So it does have an effect on deferred revenue.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And my second question is going either from Free to Pay or going to a more premium subscription. With all the security breaches that we've had over the last few months, are you seeing your customers beginning to want greater comfort in security from having more up-to-date software, better support that comes with the needing to pay for premium subscription?\n\n---\n\nWe offer the same bit stream regardless of which subscription. You get higher level of support on the higher level. And so don't think you necessarily see people buying up the higher SKUs. You certainly get customers looking to say I want to make sure that everything I'm running is running RHEL or JBoss and not free alternatives because of some of the scares. So I do think it's helpful for the business, but it's more in the Free to Pay versus a step-up in the specific product.\n\n---\n\nThank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. We look forward to catching up with you over the quarter. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Sitikantha Panigrahi (Analysts)】\nI just wanted to ask about the growth opportunity in your core Linux market. You talked about in the past that there's still opportunity left in the UNIX to Linux migration and then share gain from Windows. I just wanted to find out more on the new workload side given that now RHEL 7 have features to drive some of these newer-type workload. I was wondering, how is this RHEL 7 going to help drive that opportunity? And also, with this upcoming release of Grantley from Intel, which will probably drive more server refresh, how much of that will be tailwind for your RHEL business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, we feel really good about RHEL 7. It's one of our largest releases in terms of new features and ease of use that we've ever had. Our RHEL business continues to grow solidly in the mid-double digits. I was just out talking to customers this week. There's still substantial opportunity in UNIX to Linux. We have a lot of interest in Windows to Linux. But as you rightly say, new workload, particularly ones that are targeted to cloud, run on Linux. And so I think we win a disproportionate share of net new workload. So we still see continued growth there far off into the future.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sitikantha Panigrahi (Analysts)】\nAnd any thoughts on Grantley?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nGrantley, again, whenever we get improvements in price performance, that is another reason for people to look to drive workloads. And so we certainly think it will help. We haven't quantified the degree of help, but each time there's a new chip generation out, it does help provide a bit of a tailwind for us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Hedberg (Analysts)】\nClearly you guys are seeing the benefit of the cross-sell of emerging products, 70% this quarter in top deals. I'm curious, how much of that can be attributed to the RHEL 7 cycle here? And could we see that accelerate here as you guys start layering on these new products like Storage into the existing base?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, I doubt you'd see much out of RHEL 7 at this point. While we have people early interest in using, until you get the dot-1 [ph] release, you don't really see people putting it in production. So most of the large deals, it's still RHEL 6 related. I do think that there's more than usual interest in RHEL 7 because of its support of containers with cgroups and other performance improvements to optimize it for cloud. So I do think we'll see that, but I think the strength you're seeing now is frankly a payoff of our last 18 months of investments in our new products, which are starting to show, obviously, a lot better traction.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nAnd Matt, I'd add one other thing. Probably what's quite interesting, of the top 30 deals, once we had a very good cross-line, what was more impressive is that 9 of those top deals actually took between 5 and 10 different technologies. So it wasn't just them buying RHEL and one other thing. It was a broad portfolio in 9 of the top 30 deals.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Imtiaz Koujalgi (Analysts)】\nIt's actually Taz on behalf of Karl. I have a question on your sales and marketing line this quarter. It actually went down sequentially. Can you give more color on that, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes. Just to clarify, in the first quarter, we had the Red Hat Summit, which is a large event that we run. And we also had the OpenStack Summit, and we had a number of sales kickoffs. So I -- we had actually expected it to be flat to down for the quarter. So it performed as expected, but it was really the timing of major events that happened in the first quarter that weren't repeated in the second quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Heather Bellini (Analysts)】\nI had a question about RHEL 7. And just knowing that customers who are obviously paying maintenance will get that version, how do you think about it from the new capabilities that it might offer that might drive people to add on more products, like Charlie was just mentioning, or the ability maybe to move to higher-end SKUs? I'm just trying to get a sense of how fast you think the new capabilities you're delivering will kind of be absorbed into the market and then potentially help accelerate things on the billing side as we look to next year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, I think that the single feature that I hear about the most are -- is around containers, right? There's tremendous interest around containers. It's just a new way to build, deploy, manage applications. And I'm hearing that from the most staid European banks, right? It's not just on the West Coast of the U.S. Across the board, people are really looking at containers. And where that starts to drive things, as soon as you start saying containers, you start saying, \"Well, What kind of infrastructure do I need? How do I manage those?\" And that immediately starts bringing in the rest of our portfolio and we're having discussions around OpenShift, OpenStack. So -- and we have a lot of credibility around containers because all the work we've done in cgroups and other areas within Linux to build the foundation for containers opens up just a large strategic conversation with our customers. And that really just help the drive the whole portfolio. So again, we'll see how this develops. I will say I think we've all been surprised at how fast containers have really, I want to say, kind of hit the mainstream in terms of discussion, and therefore, it really does help drive the portfolio. How that actually drives an acceleration next year, that's a little early to say. But I will say, at least in my conversations at the CIO level, RHEL 7 has done more than any prior release to drive more strategic conversation.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matt Lemenager (Analysts)】\nThis is Matt Lemenager on for Steve. Question around OpenStack. And you acquired eNovance and you did this to get engineers. Are you taking any other steps to develop or acquire OpenStack engineering talent?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, let me start off. Yes, we got some OpenStack engineers. We got 3 things. So they were one of the 10 largest contributors to OpenStack, and so we got those. But they also have really good capabilities in deploying and managing OpenStack environment. So we thought that was a key skill set to bring in house as well as some technology around that. And finally, it really helps fill out our consulting capability, particularly in Europe. We're more than sold out in terms of our capability to deliver professional services to help our customers implement OpenStack. And this is a way to bring a number of people to bear. So there are really 3 reasons that all worked together in why eNovance makes sense. We'd certainly look for other ways to continue to augment -- just to try to catch up with demand that we're seeing to augment our skill set. So that's really the 3 reasons for eNovance.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nAnd I would add to that in terms of your second part of the question was, looking for other engineering skills for OpenStack. We're looking for great OpenStack engineers all over the world. We've got our own training programs internally. We've got OpenStack training programs that we're offering through our own external training and certification program. And we're actively recruiting where we can find good talent.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nIf you know somebody [ph], let us know.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Turits (Analysts)】\nQuestions on billings, and I know you're focusing on the trailing. But if I try to look at the short-term billings, as you break that out for us in terms of the constant currency deferred, it looks like it grew slower than long term and then billings overall. So I'm wondering what drove that and whether or not that's related to this shift towards cloud Linux sales and if that means we'll be seeing billings growth rates trail revenue growth rates on a full year basis.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nI think -- so Michael, I told you -- the last time I saw you I told you I wasn't ever going to talk about the current year billings because I do think trailing 4 quarters is the right metric. But your question is relevant given my comments about the cloud business. And I do think the cloud business is growing very rapidly. It changes the dynamics somewhat as I said. It has a very positive impact on revenues, bringing a lot of new customers to Red Hat. But it's not the same 1-year-in-advance or 3-year-in-advance subscription that we've seen through other channels. So it does have, as I said, a headwind effect or a dampening effect on billings, deferred revenue and probably ultimately operating cash flow until such time as the cloud growth is at the same pace as the rest of the business. So part of the impact that you're talking about certainly came from the public cloud. We view it as a net positive, but I think it does -- it's going to cause a rethink of some of the metrics. And it could well be that the most appropriate metric to gauge our growth is simply revenue, and we'll give more thought to that, and I'm sure we'll talk about it as the quarter progresses.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Turits (Analysts)】\nAnd anything in the short-term versus long-term mix. It seemed to be not as good on short term, better on long term this quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWell, so some -- obviously, on the cloud, there is -- there's no deferred revenue at all. But on some of the large deals, some of the very large deals we did, those are multiyear deals. And some of those still do pay 3 years upfront, which is why you see the growth in the long-term deferred revenue.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregg Moskowitz (Analysts)】\nJim, wondering if you could just talk about your expectations from Atomic Host, the container-based optimized lightweight OS, as well as when that might be generally available. And then just a quick one for Charlie, I think you mentioned that federal renewals came in at about 100%. I'm just kind of wondering if that's typical historically speaking?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes. So well, I'll start on the Atomic Host. A lot of interest not only from developers but from some cloud providers. So we have a number of discussions going on around the technology. I mean, when you start looking at the best way to run containers, we think it's the best way out there not only because it's a tailored operating system for running containers. It has all the benefits and certifications and the other benefits associated with RHEL. So a lot of interest there. Obviously, we don't talk about GA dates in advance, but we do think it can be a driver for us going forward not just as a product but as part of a portfolio of solutions to best run containers in a true production environment. So a key part of the strategy going forward.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nOn the second part of the question about the renewal, in the period of time we've been tracking this metric, it probably goes back 6 or 7 years now, I think, the lowest we've seen is 103%. We've had a couple of quarters around 105%. We've had a couple of quarters as high as 130%. And generally, the course have been around 120% uplift. The difference this quarter was the preponderance of government deals in there. And what's different with government is many times we're measuring deals, many times the deal has to do with the program. And when the government buys for a program, they typically buy the whole thing. They run the program, and there's no need for -- to go bigger than that. So I don't believe that this is a trend. I think it's a onetime thing. And as I said, there was a couple of other things which were pretty interesting. The top 25 commercial deals still were over 120%. The second thing, I think, that's even more important is 3 of the top 6 deals were not even on the radar because they weren't large deals at the last time we did something with those customers. But to get something to go to 5 -- over $5 million is, in our model, is fairly unique. It's new for us, but it's a good thing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Weiss (Analysts)】\nI was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about sort of the OpenStack ecosystem and the competitive environment. Is it like -- we've seen a lot of action in VMware, now seeing support for OpenStack, Cisco buying Metacloud, HP buying Eucalyptus. Any of these particularly impactful to you in sort of the Red Hat strategy on a going-forward basis? And how are you looking at that ecosystem evolving?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nSure. Well, first off, I think it's great, right? It just raises demand for OpenStack. More established players talking about it more and supporting it just makes it a more incredible solution. So I think it's great to have people like VMware announcing support. So all of that's great. In terms of the ecosystem, if you mean by kind of competitive landscape, we are still the only kind of player that's running our model, i.e., the enterprise model where we certify -- we have a vision -- the version that's hardened and then we build downstream ecosystem, right? So certainly, people like HP have a strategy where it's tied to their other products and services and their consulting firms out there who do it as well. But in terms of a hardened version with a built ecosystem, we've obviously been very successful doing that in other categories. And we're still the only player doing it this way. It's a little bit ironic, the first management tool vendor to certify the Red Hat OpenStack was HP. So we do believe that we go to customers, they like the fact that they can work with all of their existing vendors and all of their existing customers work with Red Hat's OpenStack. So I love the validation of others involved, and I also am very happy that no one else is trying to compete with Red Hat in our business model, which is proven and has worked well in other categories.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nYou might want to mention Cisco.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nCisco's been a great relationship. We continue to do more work with them jointly at customers. They've obviously announced partnerships in a lot of areas. We think them continuing to get more involved, whether it's the acquisition of Metacloud or some of the other things that we announced in the OpenStack appliances, are all, again, good validation of OpenStack as well as a great opportunity to go to market together.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Weiss (Analysts)】\nGot it. And if I can sneak in one for Charlie. You mentioned the acceleration of the cloud part in the revenues, the ones that you bill -- I'm sorry, you book all upfront having negative impacts on both billings and operating cash flow. Yet you left full year operating cash flow targets in place. Should I take that as an indication that you feel better about sort of -- even -- it's almost like an underlying slight raise, if you will, because of that built in cloud? Or was that already built into your thinking at the beginning of the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nNo. I mean, just to make it clear to everyone, in my view, what I did today was to raise our guidance in constant currency terms. We took the revenue guidance up at the top end of the range by $15 million. We raised the earnings per share guidance by $.0.01. And by keeping the cash flow guidance where it is, basically what it says is, in my belief, the organic growth of the -- for the base business x the cloud part of it is going to offset any headwind that comes from the cloud. So I think that a way to read it is we've raised guidance.\n\n---\n\n【質問: S. Kirk Materne (Analysts)】\nCharlie, just on the cloud business again, can you talk a little bit about the products that are being taken up as part of that? Is that mainly having a benefit -- beneficial impact on the infrastructure products? Or are you seeing some of the emerging products go through some of your cloud partners as well? And then just one follow-up that's related. Obviously, you don't have as much visibility in that revenue as you do with the rest of your revenues. So I'm wondering how that's actually impacted your sort of thought process around guidance because we've obviously seen subscription in the last 2 quarters really outperform, and yet you kept the total of your guidance even with FX headwinds. So I'm just trying to get a sense on how you're thinking about that from a guidance perspective as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes. I'll start with the beginning. It's virtually all RHEL, and it's not that we don't think our other products can sell well. But we are still working with the major cloud providers to offer our other products. So the primary product that's available generally across is RHEL, right? We continue to work out the appropriate business models for the Middleware portfolio. We obviously have them on OpenShift, so our online product. But we continue to work through the appropriate pricing, update schemes, everything else on the other products. So the only product that's generally available across cloud providers is RHEL. So virtually all of that revenue we're discussing right now is RHEL. I do believe there's a real opportunity with the other products as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nJust in terms of guidance, I'll just say again, we have effectively raised the constant currency guidance by $15 million. That $15 million headwind is something that I think all of you will have to adjust in your models because obviously, it's new news. The currency rates really started moving pretty dramatically in the last part of August, and they're still moving. But at the assumed rates that I'm using, it's a $15 million headwind. And I've kept the top of my range unchanged, which means I've raised the constant currency guidance by $15 million. Now the other part of your question in terms of how we forecast the cloud and how that might affect the guidance I give, we have 80-plus cloud providers. So there's a reasonable diversification among the providers. The other piece of information I shared is that every month since we've been tracking this, this number has been sequentially higher month-to-month. And so it does not have the same visibility as a 1-year subscription where you know exactly what it is and you can watch it day to day and come out of deferred revenue. But it is consistent [ph]. So I think in terms of my comfort with my guidance, I feel comfortable with what we've provided.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fatima Boolani (Analysts)】\nThis is Fatima Boolani on half of Brent Thill. I was wondering if you could touch on the technical interplay of the Gluster and Inktank and what that sales notion in the conversation with the customers is like on these storage solutions.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nSure. Well, first off, let me be clear. It's early days in that we only had a quarter of Inktank under our belt. Right now, they're very complimentary. In terms of GA products, Ceph offers block and object store. Gluster offers file store. So they really solve different use cases. And so today, the go-to-market motion is whatever you need, we got it to some extent because we now cover all 3 storage use cases. And so the go-to-market motion is pretty simple that way. Again, we're 1 quarter in on the Inktank side with the Ceph technologies in. So far, they're performing quite well, I think above our expectations, but obviously, in a short amount of time. As we go forward, we'll continue to hone those use cases as we see kind of what works best.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Walter Pritchard (Analysts)】\nJust another follow-up on the cloud business that you've been talking about here for several quarters. Charlie, I'm wondering -- just kind of a 2-part question on your end. Was there any sort of change or shifting of the type of that business that's caused it to have the revenue impact that you're seeing this quarter? And then just kind of quick one for Jim on the same subject. Is this the -- I don't know, you're probably not going to name, names. But are these sort of the larger Amazon-like cloud providers? Are these specialized industry vertical types? I'd love to hear some color on where you're seeing the strengths, particularly in that business, from what types of providers?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nYes. So the first part of the question just on the numbers, I mean, the growth rate has accelerated. That's really the only change. And the number of cloud providers that are now Red Hat certified has grown as well. I think when we talked at Analyst Day, I think we were talking about in the number of 50 or thereabouts, and it's now over 80. So all of the big names that you could think of are included in that number, and there's a lot of smaller names as well. But it's a very broad group of public cloud providers not just in the U.S. now. This is global.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nThe only other comment I would say is it's generally the large cloud providers, the specialists, so say what IBM is doing with soft layer or those type of things, we have a lot of use on those. But those are generally part of existing enterprise agreements where they can bring their own subscription to other clouds. So a specialized cloud provider is more likely to be working with a large enterprise. They'll bring their own subscription, and that shows up in our regular subscription. So this is the big names that you would normally think about as general public cloud providers.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Abhey Lamba (Analysts)】\nJust continuing on the cloud thing. How many of these 80-plus providers are fully ramped up? Or is there still room for them to improve their output? Also, what's your road map to expand the channel? And lastly, what are the things that give you comfort that this revenue is not cannibalistic to your core business or won't be cannibalistic down the road?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nSo the first part of the question about is there growth, in my view, there's definitely room for growth through the public clouds. I just look at some of the names there. Some of the really big clouds are just getting started. And so there's -- in my view, there's clearly room for growth. The second part of the question about whether it is cannibalistic or not, is there a trade-off? We have had some data, which we've seen from one of our large cloud providers, that basically provided the confidence for me to say that we think more than 50% of this business thus far, at least, has been from small- and medium-sized businesses, many of whom have never before been Red Hat customers. So there's a large percentage of new business here. We also have the Cloud Access program, which Jim was referring to. That's the existing Red Hat customers that have a fully paid subscription in the Cloud Access program. They are allowed to move that subscription from their own data center onto a public cloud. Now that, as Jim said, that would not be accounted for in the number I'm using because they've already paid us for the subscription. But there's another form of usage in the public cloud. And I think there's still plenty of room for growth with these cloud providers.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Abhey Lamba (Analysts)】\nAnd really quickly, did you disclose the average deal length? As deal sizes are getting bigger, is there any change in duration or is that mainly more products?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nI did not disclose it, but it's 21 months. So it's been pretty consistent now at 21 months for quite a long time, average deal length.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Wood (Analysts)】\nI thought I'd ask a question on the Middleware side. You guys clearly have -- you have a big JBoss installed base. I'm curious if there's still a large percentage on older versions and what you may be doing to kind of push more upgrade to drive more upselling with the broader portfolio you have today.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nWell, first off, just a reminder on our business model, we sell a subscription to a product, not to specific versions. So if someone has a subscription, they can use whichever version they choose. But I do think you bring up a good point where JBoss, there is still a substantial amount of free JBoss out there. And one of our core go-to-markets on JBoss is going out and explaining why I paid subscription with updates and support and all the things that go along with that is a good business. So there are really 3 main go-to-markets on JBoss. One is the Free to Pay. We have a substantial business of WebSphere and WebLogic to JBoss replacements. And then thirdly and probably most importantly, a lot of companies are standardizing. So all their new application development happens on JBoss. And that's probably the single largest of the 3. But they're all reasonable drivers of growth in Middleware.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Zeller (Analysts)】\nAnother cloud question. I think I heard from comments a moment ago that about 50% of the business is from customers you did not have a relationship with previously. How would you say that skews as far as the value of those deals? I mean, I would anticipate that most large companies already have relationships. So this is -- those 50% of people that are new are probably on the lower end of the scale for dollar volume and subscription size, correct?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nWell, in the value of the deals that are in the cloud, they're probably representative of a large portion of what's actually in the cloud. Comparing their volume in the cloud, however, to some of our larger deals like the $5 million and $10 million deals that we've done -- talked about this quarter, they're not -- definitely not in the same ballpark. I like to think about it as you planting seeds over time, we -- almost every one of our customers started in a very small way with a few subscriptions. And over time, they've grown now to $5 million and $10 million types of transactions. The 3 I talked about before that moved to something over $5 million this quarter from not a large deal last time is interesting, and it's unusual, and we simply hope that keeps going. But most deals -- most customers will just progress over time, and we think these small deals will do the same.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nJust to clarify, that 50% is 50% of dollars, not 50% of customers that Charlie was referring to that are new to Red Hat.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Zeller (Analysts)】\nMaybe I should -- thank you for that color. Maybe I should ask the question differently. When you look at the landscape of customers that you have going through your certified public cloud business, does it skew towards Fortune 2000? Or is there a pretty even distribution between large enterprises and smaller enterprises? Maybe some color on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nFrankly, it's hard to know exactly because we don't necessarily get the end-user customer data for all of it. From what we can tell, it certainly skews substantially smaller, right? This is -- the certified cloud provider recognizes the Cloud Access. Larger customers in that subscriptions can also run those on cloud. That's a different component of revenue that shows up in traditional RHEL, right? These are people who are giving their credit card or doing a different payment, which is why I think it heavily skews to new users.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tim Klasell (Analysts)】\nJust 2 quick ones. On the cloud service providers, are most of those deals in U.S. dollar? As that continues to grow, could we see a little bit of a dampening effect from the currency swings we see on the deferred revenues -- or in revenues overall, I should say?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nFrom a dollar perspective, I think it's safe to say that the majority of the business is done in U.S. dollars, that's true, yes. And I think your second comment is actually what I was trying to say, is the business model is a little bit different. We've got the revenue is recognized in arrears. So there is no billing for 1 year in advance or 3 year in advance, the longer subscriptions that we would normally do. So it does have an effect on deferred revenue.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tim Klasell (Analysts)】\nOkay. And my second question is going either from Free to Pay or going to a more premium subscription. With all the security breaches that we've had over the last few months, are you seeing your customers beginning to want greater comfort in security from having more up-to-date software, better support that comes with the needing to pay for premium subscription?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nWe offer the same bit stream regardless of which subscription. You get higher level of support on the higher level. And so don't think you necessarily see people buying up the higher SKUs. You certainly get customers looking to say I want to make sure that everything I'm running is running RHEL or JBoss and not free alternatives because of some of the scares. So I do think it's helpful for the business, but it's more in the Free to Pay versus a step-up in the specific product.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nThank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call.

Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today.\r\nBefore we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings and Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com.\r\nAfter our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] We are hopeful that you can join us for our 2014 Investor Conference in Cincinnati, beginning on the evening of October 28 and ending early afternoon on October 29. Details will be coming soon and we are looking forward to seeing many of you then. \r\nI will now turn the call over to Rodney McMullen, Chief Executive Officer of Kroger.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's second quarter 2014 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\r\nKroger achieved a strong and balanced second quarter. As we improved our connection with customers, we are also executing our growth plan and delivering on our key performance indicators, all of which is fueling strong financial results for our shareholders. Our second quarter performance highlights Kroger's continued growth momentum. \r\nWe continue to deliver on the performance targets we outlined at our October 2012 Investor Conference, including: positive identical store sales growth; slightly expanding rolling 4 quarters FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel; and improving return on invested capital.\r\nFor the period, we achieved our 43rd consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin, without fuel, on a rolling 4-quarter basis; and we increased our return on invested capital, while also increasing capital investment. Based on our strong quarter results, we are raising our net earnings per diluted share guidance and our identical supermarket sales growth guidance for the year. We expect to deliver a net earnings per diluted share growth of 13% to 15% for fiscal 2014. As you know, this is partially due to the benefit of Harris Teeter. We expect to return to our long-term growth rate of 8% to 11%, plus the dividend, in fiscal 2012 -- 2015, sorry. Thanks, Cindy. \r\nAnd we are not done growing and differentiating to better serve our customers. We are proud to welcome the incredible Vitacost.com team to The Kroger family. We are excited about the opportunity the merger creates to transform the customer experience and move Kroger directly into the e-commerce space much faster than we could have done on our own. The merger closed last month and our teams are hard at work developing our combined business plan. Mike Ellis will have more to say about Vitacost in a few minutes. \r\nOur merger with Harris Teeter is going very well and we are learning a lot from each other and we can't say enough great things about our Harris Teeter associates.\r\nWe continue to see positive indicators in customer shopping behavior, both what our customers tell us and what their actual shopping behavior says. Kroger's data suggests some greater confidence in the economy and less caution in spending, consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. Even so, confidence in the economy and the economic recovery is not pervasive across the board. Many of our customers are still struggling and we continue to pursue our strategy of connecting meaningfully with all customers, wherever they are in the economic spectrum. \r\nIt is worth noting that our definition of a loyal customer is based on a combination of how often a customer shops with us and the amount of products they purchase from Kroger. We have loyal customers in every segment of the customer spectrum, from value customers to upscale shoppers and everywhere in between. \r\nWe continue to see our loyal households grow at a faster rate than total households. As you know, we developed the 4 Keys of our Customer 1st Strategy more than 10 years ago because we recognized that customers wanted a grocery retailer that would deliver not just 1 or 2 key advantages, but a total combination, including a great overall shopping experience, excellent customer service, a full assortment of both national and corporate brand products and everyday low prices and promotional offerings. \r\nToday, our customer research tells us that this is even more important. Our customers don't want to compromise by choosing retailers who do only well in only 1 or 2 areas. In short, customers are looking for a food retailer that can offer it all and that is Kroger's sweet spot. That is exactly where we've positioned ourselves to win, it is where we are winning and it is where we intend to continue to win. \r\nNow I'll turn it over to Mike Ellis to outline our operational performance. Mike?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Rodney. Good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to thank our associates for their solid performance. Strong and consistent execution is what allows us to continue making investments in all the 4 keys of our Customer 1st Strategy, including investments in our associates and ongoing price investment.\r\nAs Rodney said, loyal households grew at a faster rate than total households, which also grew for the quarter. This is important because it tells us that we are connecting with our customers across the entire spectrum and that we are connecting in the right areas: people, products and shopping experience and price. \r\nAs expected, inflation continued to increase during the quarter, especially in meat, dairy and in pharmacy, which continued to produce solid growth in both script count and ID sales. We estimate inflation, excluding fuel and pharmacy, was 2.4% in the second quarter and 2.8% with pharmacy. Even with higher inflation, we saw strong tonnage growth during the second quarter.\r\nOur corporate brands portfolio continues to resonate with our customers. During the second quarter, our corporate brands represented approximately 26.3% of total units sold and 25.2% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. We saw strong double-digit unit and sales growth in Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organics. Our new entry-level price point brands and premium tier Private Selection brand all had strong positive sales and unit gains in the second quarter as well.\r\nAnother driver of sustainable growth is Customer 1st innovation. For the past few quarters, we have highlighted innovations that are improving our connection with customers and growing our market share. This quarter, I would like to focus on our merger with Vitacost.com. \r\nFirst, I'd like to echo Rodney's welcome to the Vitacost team. You're now part of team Kroger and we couldn't be more excited about that. This is a compelling transaction because of the incredible potential for transformation and growth. We believe Kroger is uniquely positioned to blend the art of retailing and deep customer insights with a superb online experience. Vitacost people and extensive e-commerce platform, coupled with Kroger's customer insights and loyal customer base, will really be a powerful combination that we can leverage to create new levels of personalization and convenience for our customers. We intend to build on Vitacost's robust technology platform and integrate it with our existing digital footprint to do just that. \r\nThis is one of the reasons we recently asked Kevin Dougherty, who has been serving as Kroger's Group Vice President and Chief Supply Chain Officer, to lead this effort in a new role as Group Vice President of Digital and Vitacost. Kevin has been a leader on the Vitacost merger team from the beginning and, for the past several years, he has been increasingly focused on building our digital organization here at Kroger. We look forward to combining our teams to do great things for our customers together.\r\nNow I'd like to provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently completed several successful contract negotiations, covering Food 4 Less associates in Southern California and Kroger associates in Cincinnati and Dayton. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW for store associates in New Mexico, Toledo and agreements with the teams just covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. \r\nKroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and more career opportunities and will enhance job security for our associates.\r\nNow Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's financial results and update our guidance for 2014. Mike?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. When we outlined our accelerated growth strategy at our October 2012 Investor Conference, we also identified the key performance targets for shareholders to measure our progress. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the results in each metric. \r\nOur first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. We're very pleased with our second quarter ID sales growth of 4.8%. This strong performance was supported by ID sales growth in every department in every supermarket division. Our natural foods department continues to grow in the double digits, accelerated by significant household gains. Rolling 4 quarters FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and adjustment items, expanded by 7 basis points. Over time, we expect our FIFO operating margin growth rate, excluding fuel, to return to slightly expanding on a rolling 4 quarters basis.\r\nThe third target metric is return on invested capital. We reported a return on invested capital on a rolling 4 quarters basis, excluding adjustment items of 13.6%, which was an increase from 13.5% in the same period last year. Increased capital investments will make it more difficult to grow ROIC in the near term, however, we expect these investments to be accretive to ROIC as they mature. We expect our year-end ROIC, which will factor in a full year of increased capital investments and fully reflect Harris Teeter in our calculation, to show a slight decline compared to the end of fiscal 2013.\r\nNow I'll share our second quarter 2014 results in more detail. Please note that this quarter includes Harris Teeter and Kroger's statement of operations, so year-over-year percentage comparisons are affected as a result. \r\nIn the second quarter, our net earnings totaled $347 million or $0.70 per diluted share. Net earnings in the same period last year were $317 million or $0.60 per diluted share. As Mike said, we are seeing higher inflation than originally anticipated. We recorded a $26 million LIFO charge during the quarter, compared to a $13 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. We began fiscal 2014 estimating LIFO for the year at $55 million. At the end of the first quarter, we increased our LIFO guidance to a charge of $90 million. As reported this morning, we are increasing our LIFO estimate for the year to $100 million, which is an incremental $0.01 charge to net earnings per diluted share in the second quarter and $0.05 to $0.06 for the full year.\r\nAs we have mentioned in the past, we manage the company without regard to our LIFO charge and many of the items we discussed are on a FIFO basis. So when we develop our expectations for every given year, we estimate LIFO last. The reason for this is LIFO is merely an accounting convention. Typically, a higher LIFO charge would be a headwind to results, but our strong sales helped us overcome the higher-than-expected charge and increase our guidance. FIFO gross margin decreased 12 basis points from the same period last year, excluding retail fuel operations. \r\nOperating, general and administrative costs, plus rent and depreciation, excluding retail fuel operations, were essentially flat as a percent of sales compared to the prior year. Increases in workers' compensation and general liability reserves negatively affected this comparison by 8 basis points.\r\nNow for retail fuel operations. About half of our supermarkets have fuel centers today. In the second quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.18 compared to $0.165 in the same quarter last year. \r\nOur long-term financial strategy continues to be: maintain our current investment grade debt rating, repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend and fund increasing capital investments. Achieving the 2x to 2.2x net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio by mid to late 2015 remains a key objective. Kroger took on debt to finance the Harris Teeter merger and has not yet final -- realized a full year of Harris Teeter EBITDA. This has caused a significant increase in the company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, which is 2.33x as of the close of the second quarter compared to 1.77x during the same period last year. This is, however, an improvement from the 2.42x we reported last quarter.\r\nKroger's net total debt is $11.2 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion from a year ago. This includes the debt related to the Harris Teeter transaction and the share repurchases activity so far this year. Kroger's strong financial position allow the company to return more than $1.9 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. During the second quarter, Kroger repurchased 1.6 million common shares for a total investment of $78 million. All $500 million of the buyback authorization in June, granted in June, is still available.\r\nCapital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $672 million for the second quarter compared to $507 million for the same period last year. We continue to expect capital investments to be in the $2.8 billion to $3 billion range, including Harris Teeter for fiscal 2014.\r\nNow I'd like to update our growth objectives for 2014. Based on our strong second quarter results, we raised and narrowed our adjusted net earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $3.22 to $3.28 for fiscal 2014. The previous guidance was $3.19 to $3.27 per diluted share. The company's long-term net earnings per diluted share growth guidance remains 8% to 11% and shareholder return will be further enhanced by dividend expected to increase over time.\r\nWe raised our identical supermarket sales growth guidance, excluding fuel, to 3.5% to 4.25% for fiscal 2014. The previous guidance was 3% to 4%. We are optimistic, as we look forward to the remainder of the year but, keep in mind, we had a very strong fourth quarter last year to compare to.\r\nNow I'll turn it back to Rodney.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Mike. As I've said this before, this is an exciting time to be at Kroger. We are accelerating growth in our core business and investing in unique competitive positioning for today and the future. Integration with Harris Teeter is going exactly the way we would hope and we continue to learn from each other in ways to improve our customers' experiences. We see transformational potential in Vitacost's e-commerce platform. We are currently hiring to fill an estimated 20,000 positions in our supermarket stores. Next week, we will open our 2,000th fuel center location and we are well on our way to exceeding our long-term earnings per share growth rate for fiscal 2014.\r\nNow we look forward to answering your questions. Laura, we'll take our questions now.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Cindy Holmes (Executives)】\nThank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today.\r\nBefore we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings and Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com.\r\nAfter our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] We are hopeful that you can join us for our 2014 Investor Conference in Cincinnati, beginning on the evening of October 28 and ending early afternoon on October 29. Details will be coming soon and we are looking forward to seeing many of you then. \r\nI will now turn the call over to Rodney McMullen, Chief Executive Officer of Kroger.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's second quarter 2014 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\r\nKroger achieved a strong and balanced second quarter. As we improved our connection with customers, we are also executing our growth plan and delivering on our key performance indicators, all of which is fueling strong financial results for our shareholders. Our second quarter performance highlights Kroger's continued growth momentum. \r\nWe continue to deliver on the performance targets we outlined at our October 2012 Investor Conference, including: positive identical store sales growth; slightly expanding rolling 4 quarters FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel; and improving return on invested capital.\r\nFor the period, we achieved our 43rd consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin, without fuel, on a rolling 4-quarter basis; and we increased our return on invested capital, while also increasing capital investment. Based on our strong quarter results, we are raising our net earnings per diluted share guidance and our identical supermarket sales growth guidance for the year. We expect to deliver a net earnings per diluted share growth of 13% to 15% for fiscal 2014. As you know, this is partially due to the benefit of Harris Teeter. We expect to return to our long-term growth rate of 8% to 11%, plus the dividend, in fiscal 2012 -- 2015, sorry. Thanks, Cindy. \r\nAnd we are not done growing and differentiating to better serve our customers. We are proud to welcome the incredible Vitacost.com team to The Kroger family. We are excited about the opportunity the merger creates to transform the customer experience and move Kroger directly into the e-commerce space much faster than we could have done on our own. The merger closed last month and our teams are hard at work developing our combined business plan. Mike Ellis will have more to say about Vitacost in a few minutes. \r\nOur merger with Harris Teeter is going very well and we are learning a lot from each other and we can't say enough great things about our Harris Teeter associates.\r\nWe continue to see positive indicators in customer shopping behavior, both what our customers tell us and what their actual shopping behavior says. Kroger's data suggests some greater confidence in the economy and less caution in spending, consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. Even so, confidence in the economy and the economic recovery is not pervasive across the board. Many of our customers are still struggling and we continue to pursue our strategy of connecting meaningfully with all customers, wherever they are in the economic spectrum. \r\nIt is worth noting that our definition of a loyal customer is based on a combination of how often a customer shops with us and the amount of products they purchase from Kroger. We have loyal customers in every segment of the customer spectrum, from value customers to upscale shoppers and everywhere in between. \r\nWe continue to see our loyal households grow at a faster rate than total households. As you know, we developed the 4 Keys of our Customer 1st Strategy more than 10 years ago because we recognized that customers wanted a grocery retailer that would deliver not just 1 or 2 key advantages, but a total combination, including a great overall shopping experience, excellent customer service, a full assortment of both national and corporate brand products and everyday low prices and promotional offerings. \r\nToday, our customer research tells us that this is even more important. Our customers don't want to compromise by choosing retailers who do only well in only 1 or 2 areas. In short, customers are looking for a food retailer that can offer it all and that is Kroger's sweet spot. That is exactly where we've positioned ourselves to win, it is where we are winning and it is where we intend to continue to win. \r\nNow I'll turn it over to Mike Ellis to outline our operational performance. Mike?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nThanks, Rodney. Good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to thank our associates for their solid performance. Strong and consistent execution is what allows us to continue making investments in all the 4 keys of our Customer 1st Strategy, including investments in our associates and ongoing price investment.\r\nAs Rodney said, loyal households grew at a faster rate than total households, which also grew for the quarter. This is important because it tells us that we are connecting with our customers across the entire spectrum and that we are connecting in the right areas: people, products and shopping experience and price. \r\nAs expected, inflation continued to increase during the quarter, especially in meat, dairy and in pharmacy, which continued to produce solid growth in both script count and ID sales. We estimate inflation, excluding fuel and pharmacy, was 2.4% in the second quarter and 2.8% with pharmacy. Even with higher inflation, we saw strong tonnage growth during the second quarter.\r\nOur corporate brands portfolio continues to resonate with our customers. During the second quarter, our corporate brands represented approximately 26.3% of total units sold and 25.2% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. We saw strong double-digit unit and sales growth in Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organics. Our new entry-level price point brands and premium tier Private Selection brand all had strong positive sales and unit gains in the second quarter as well.\r\nAnother driver of sustainable growth is Customer 1st innovation. For the past few quarters, we have highlighted innovations that are improving our connection with customers and growing our market share. This quarter, I would like to focus on our merger with Vitacost.com. \r\nFirst, I'd like to echo Rodney's welcome to the Vitacost team. You're now part of team Kroger and we couldn't be more excited about that. This is a compelling transaction because of the incredible potential for transformation and growth. We believe Kroger is uniquely positioned to blend the art of retailing and deep customer insights with a superb online experience. Vitacost people and extensive e-commerce platform, coupled with Kroger's customer insights and loyal customer base, will really be a powerful combination that we can leverage to create new levels of personalization and convenience for our customers. We intend to build on Vitacost's robust technology platform and integrate it with our existing digital footprint to do just that. \r\nThis is one of the reasons we recently asked Kevin Dougherty, who has been serving as Kroger's Group Vice President and Chief Supply Chain Officer, to lead this effort in a new role as Group Vice President of Digital and Vitacost. Kevin has been a leader on the Vitacost merger team from the beginning and, for the past several years, he has been increasingly focused on building our digital organization here at Kroger. We look forward to combining our teams to do great things for our customers together.\r\nNow I'd like to provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently completed several successful contract negotiations, covering Food 4 Less associates in Southern California and Kroger associates in Cincinnati and Dayton. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW for store associates in New Mexico, Toledo and agreements with the teams just covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. \r\nKroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and more career opportunities and will enhance job security for our associates.\r\nNow Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's financial results and update our guidance for 2014. Mike?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. When we outlined our accelerated growth strategy at our October 2012 Investor Conference, we also identified the key performance targets for shareholders to measure our progress. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the results in each metric. \r\nOur first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. We're very pleased with our second quarter ID sales growth of 4.8%. This strong performance was supported by ID sales growth in every department in every supermarket division. Our natural foods department continues to grow in the double digits, accelerated by significant household gains. Rolling 4 quarters FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and adjustment items, expanded by 7 basis points. Over time, we expect our FIFO operating margin growth rate, excluding fuel, to return to slightly expanding on a rolling 4 quarters basis.\r\nThe third target metric is return on invested capital. We reported a return on invested capital on a rolling 4 quarters basis, excluding adjustment items of 13.6%, which was an increase from 13.5% in the same period last year. Increased capital investments will make it more difficult to grow ROIC in the near term, however, we expect these investments to be accretive to ROIC as they mature. We expect our year-end ROIC, which will factor in a full year of increased capital investments and fully reflect Harris Teeter in our calculation, to show a slight decline compared to the end of fiscal 2013.\r\nNow I'll share our second quarter 2014 results in more detail. Please note that this quarter includes Harris Teeter and Kroger's statement of operations, so year-over-year percentage comparisons are affected as a result. \r\nIn the second quarter, our net earnings totaled $347 million or $0.70 per diluted share. Net earnings in the same period last year were $317 million or $0.60 per diluted share. As Mike said, we are seeing higher inflation than originally anticipated. We recorded a $26 million LIFO charge during the quarter, compared to a $13 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. We began fiscal 2014 estimating LIFO for the year at $55 million. At the end of the first quarter, we increased our LIFO guidance to a charge of $90 million. As reported this morning, we are increasing our LIFO estimate for the year to $100 million, which is an incremental $0.01 charge to net earnings per diluted share in the second quarter and $0.05 to $0.06 for the full year.\r\nAs we have mentioned in the past, we manage the company without regard to our LIFO charge and many of the items we discussed are on a FIFO basis. So when we develop our expectations for every given year, we estimate LIFO last. The reason for this is LIFO is merely an accounting convention. Typically, a higher LIFO charge would be a headwind to results, but our strong sales helped us overcome the higher-than-expected charge and increase our guidance. FIFO gross margin decreased 12 basis points from the same period last year, excluding retail fuel operations. \r\nOperating, general and administrative costs, plus rent and depreciation, excluding retail fuel operations, were essentially flat as a percent of sales compared to the prior year. Increases in workers' compensation and general liability reserves negatively affected this comparison by 8 basis points.\r\nNow for retail fuel operations. About half of our supermarkets have fuel centers today. In the second quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.18 compared to $0.165 in the same quarter last year. \r\nOur long-term financial strategy continues to be: maintain our current investment grade debt rating, repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend and fund increasing capital investments. Achieving the 2x to 2.2x net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio by mid to late 2015 remains a key objective. Kroger took on debt to finance the Harris Teeter merger and has not yet final -- realized a full year of Harris Teeter EBITDA. This has caused a significant increase in the company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, which is 2.33x as of the close of the second quarter compared to 1.77x during the same period last year. This is, however, an improvement from the 2.42x we reported last quarter.\r\nKroger's net total debt is $11.2 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion from a year ago. This includes the debt related to the Harris Teeter transaction and the share repurchases activity so far this year. Kroger's strong financial position allow the company to return more than $1.9 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. During the second quarter, Kroger repurchased 1.6 million common shares for a total investment of $78 million. All $500 million of the buyback authorization in June, granted in June, is still available.\r\nCapital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $672 million for the second quarter compared to $507 million for the same period last year. We continue to expect capital investments to be in the $2.8 billion to $3 billion range, including Harris Teeter for fiscal 2014.\r\nNow I'd like to update our growth objectives for 2014. Based on our strong second quarter results, we raised and narrowed our adjusted net earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $3.22 to $3.28 for fiscal 2014. The previous guidance was $3.19 to $3.27 per diluted share. The company's long-term net earnings per diluted share growth guidance remains 8% to 11% and shareholder return will be further enhanced by dividend expected to increase over time.\r\nWe raised our identical supermarket sales growth guidance, excluding fuel, to 3.5% to 4.25% for fiscal 2014. The previous guidance was 3% to 4%. We are optimistic, as we look forward to the remainder of the year but, keep in mind, we had a very strong fourth quarter last year to compare to.\r\nNow I'll turn it back to Rodney.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThanks, Mike. As I've said this before, this is an exciting time to be at Kroger. We are accelerating growth in our core business and investing in unique competitive positioning for today and the future. Integration with Harris Teeter is going exactly the way we would hope and we continue to learn from each other in ways to improve our customers' experiences. We see transformational potential in Vitacost's e-commerce platform. We are currently hiring to fill an estimated 20,000 positions in our supermarket stores. Next week, we will open our 2,000th fuel center location and we are well on our way to exceeding our long-term earnings per share growth rate for fiscal 2014.\r\nNow we look forward to answering your questions. Laura, we'll take our questions now.",
      "transcript_text3": "So 2 questions. Number one, how much of the inflation that you saw in the quarter do you think actually passed through? Maybe, on a percent basis, did you pass 50% of it through or 75%? What's the general thought there? And then given your -- around your comments about the economy, I would think you probably could get a lot more of that pass-through here in the third quarter or is that not right?\n\n---\n\nYes, on your second question, I wouldn't necessarily agree or disagree with that. And as you know, inflation is -- you really do have to look at it item by item. And as Mike mentioned, even with the inflation, we still had strong tonnage growth and we're very happy with the results in total. A lot of the inflation right now is in some of the perishable areas, the fresh departments and that, as you know, is very seasonal. And if you look at, like, some of the produce inflation, as soon as the next crop comes on, that can heavily impact it. On percentage, I would hesitate to give it because in some areas, we feel comfortable we probably passed 100%, others, not so. And as you know, overall, as I mentioned, tonnage is strong. We continue to reduce our pricing for our customers as we take cost out of the business to do that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then, secondly, so if you think about Harris Teeter, how much scope is there for that organization to accelerate unit growth? I know there's a lot of potential for new stores, but -- and I don't know if that's spread out over more years, can they accelerate unit growth? And if they can't, if there's the capacity to do that, given the lead time on real estate, when would that be? Is that a '16 or '17 time frame or sooner?\n\n---\n\nJohn, I think you'll see Harris Teeter have a little bit higher store growth over the next several years than they otherwise would have. They had a lot of projects in the pipeline as the 2 companies came together with the merger and the nice thing about joining Kroger for them is it gives them a little bit more capital capacity to be a little faster on getting some of those store projects up and running. It is true, in many of the markets they operate, where we have growth opportunities, the D.C. area, the Baltimore area, markets like that, the lead time is a little bit longer, but they've always had a very strong and forward-thinking capital plan. It's really just the ability now for them to accelerate some of those a little faster than they may have on their own. So we would expect that their unit growth will kick up from where it has been historically.\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible] average, the lead time is probably, what, 1 to 2 years longer than what we've been traditionally used to, unless you go to the West Coast.\n\n---\n\nRight.\n\n---\n\nSo I wanted to dive a little deeper into your expenses for the quarter. So compared to the past few quarters, we saw less expense leverage and I know you guys called out the more difficult comparison. Was there anything else that was unusual this quarter? And were the expenses in line with your internal plans?\n\n---\n\nYes, they were generally in line with our internal plans. The item that we called out in both -- well, that I just spoke of in the conference call, some increases in workers' comp and general liability reserves, a little bit of increase for this year, as well as some prior year increases in the allowances for that caused about an 8-basis-point negative effect on the OG&A lines. So we would've had a little bit better improvement or we would've shown some improvement if not for the need to increase those allowances. And I can tell you, that is certainly a point of focus for our operators and our loss prevention folks. The key to that isn't the dollars, it's making sure the accidents never happen.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then shifting to e-commerce, we've seen a lot more noise lately, whether it's from Amazon or Whole Foods and some of your competitors and you guys have clearly made investments with Vitacost. I mean, how do you feel about your current capabilities versus the competition right now?\n\n---\n\nIt's a good question. I would say we feel very good, but we're not satisfied. And the changes that we've made over the last couple of years, we feel increasingly happy about what we're seeing. As you know, it's one of the things when we merged with Harris Teeter that we were really excited about. They have an incredibly strong click and collect operation that we're spending a lot of time on. And as you know, when we announced merging with Vitacost, they have a great group of people from a talent perspective and a great infrastructure that we think we can grow off and expand. So I feel very comfortable where we are positioned from a food standpoint relative to our competition. I feel even more excited about some of the things that we've put in place to take advantage of the future. Mike or Mike, do you want to add to that?\n\n---\n\nNothing, other than the fact that the merger just closed a month ago and we are working hard to bring both companies together and see all the benefits we can come up with here.\n\n---\n\nI just wanted to dive a little bit into gross margins. So obviously, there's been a lot of news and press about Harris Teeter taking prices down and it's hard to know how much that would've impacted your gross margins on your P&L. But by my math, your core FIFO margins, excluding Harris Teeter, could actually have been up this quarter. Is that a fair statement? And then, I guess, maybe talk about how generics might have impacted your gross margin and other points that might be relevant.\n\n---\n\nRelative to Harris Teeter, I won't go to that level of transparency. Harris Teeter is not the only place that we continue to invest in price. They've -- it's been fairly public about the price reductions they've done and where they've done them, but we continue to refine our pricing strategy in all the geographies we operate. And our goal always remains to grow our operating profit margin on a rolling 4-quarter basis slightly. We were 7 basis points and I've never given a specific number, although Rodney and Cindy both pitted me a little bit yesterday that I've always said, \"By that, it's a handful or less,\" and most people can count how many digits are on both of my hands. And it would be only 1 hand, not 2. So that's why we said we actually exceeded that goal a little bit this time and that's what we always focus on. And when we get the operating leverage, we can accelerate things that we plan to do later. And if things aren't quite trending the way we want to grow operating profit margin, we can slow a few things down. We've become very nimble on that arena, which has been a huge help.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So then, just on your quarter, in general, did you guys -- you guys came in above plan in the second quarter, is that fair to say? And then, I guess, it was ahead of plan on earnings. Was that more gas margin related? And I guess, I'm wondering because you didn't beat the Street by much, but your gross margins came in quite a bit higher and yet, you're raising your full year guidance on the low end by $0.03, so...\n\n---\n\nI think it's a combination of things, Karen. The strong sales, certainly, are encouraging for us and that momentum is always good. If you look at everything that has happened and the fact that we've increased our LIFO charge by what will amount to $0.05 or $0.06 more charge than we expected at the beginning of the year, we've now raised our earnings guidance twice, we've now raised our ID sales guidance. It's the combination of those factors that has allowed us to remain quite positive. While we only beat the Street by $0.01, LIFO cost us $0.01 and the 8 basis points from workers' comp and general liability would've been somewhere between $0.015 and $0.02, probably, at least, $0.02, depending on how things round. So despite those headwinds, the underlying strength of our core businesses, we're very happy with it.\n\n---\n\nAnd the top line strength has continued into the third quarter?\n\n---\n\nYes. So far, through the third quarter, it's very similar to where we were in the first and second quarters and I'm pleased with the continued progress.\n\n---\n\nIf we look at the P&L just for the third quarter, are there any Vitacost acquisition expenses worth calling out, Mike?\n\n---\n\nWe haven't really called out any merger-related expenses for Harris Teeter for a while. We had some, actually leading up to the merger, there's been a few small ones out there, nothing amounting to much of anything, although a lot of the heavy lifting on -- as we convert systems and maybe happened to write some of the assets off of their books that they have capitalized as we convert to our systems. Those things might face us in the future. But those aren't cash expenditures, they're things that were spent in the past. And Vitacost is just so new. Sure, there was a handful of expenses leading up to the merger. While we used outside counsel, we didn't use an outside financial advisor, so it's not like we had any kind of a fee to pay a third party in that. So there really wasn't much at all.\n\n---\n\nAnd then, in your guidance for the remainder of the year, Mike, how much dilution from Vitacost is built into that number?\n\n---\n\nIt's negligible for the back half of the year and it's certainly contemplated in our guidance. They were actually operating here, very recently, at very close to a breakeven kind of a level. And we have a little bit of dilution built in, but nothing dramatic that we don't think we can overcome with the strength of the underlying operations.\n\n---\n\nSo something like less than $0.05 per share?\n\n---\n\nYes, sir.\n\n---\n\nLess than a handful of pennies.\n\n---\n\nMost of my questions have been asked, but I just wanted to delve into the balance sheet. Mike, I know you talked about 2.33x and your 1.7x -- and I probably got the numbers all messed up, but you want to get them -- you want to get down to 2x. But clearly, there's been a lot of activity in the space. I just wonder, from your perspective, does your balance sheet right now preclude you from doing other things? Or would it -- it's a factor? Or how are you thinking about your balance sheet, given the fact that there's been so much activity in the space vis-à-vis M&A?\n\n---\n\nWe were 1.77x last year and we were at 2.33x this year, which was 9 basis points down from the first quarter. We feel very comfortable we're on track to get to the 2x to 2.2x. We'll be happy at the high-end of the range. We don't necessarily have to get to the 2.0x, Scott. That's just the range we winded up giving. I don't know that our balance sheet necessarily precludes us from doing anything. If the right opportunity is out there and we go to the rating agencies and they understand the uniqueness of an opportunity, like they clearly did with Harris Teeter, and our follow-through, when we make a commitment to them that we actually follow through on what we do, whether it's how we expect to grow the dividend, how we expect to use cash flow to buy in shares, how we expect to use capital to grow our business organically, we're very open with the rating agencies and follow through on the commitments we make. And if it's the right set of assets with the right growth opportunity, like Harris Teeter was with all the new markets, I don't think we would be precluded from continuing to participate in industry consolidation.\n\n---\n\nThe other thing is the 1.77x was unusually low because we had stopped buying back stocks and some other things because we had already announced the Harris Teeter merger and we wanted to position ourself well to being able to merge with Harris Teeter.\n\n---\n\nThat's an excellent point. We were actually out of the market on shares for quite a while, as we were blacked out while we were looking at it as well. So it was a combination of factors.\n\n---\n\nThat's perfect. And if I could have one more. I think you guys recently opened up 121,000 square-foot in Athens, Georgia and I think the comments and what I've read is that there's a bigger one to come down there. You guys are really the only ones opening up bigger stores, even Walmart is shrinking what they're trying to do. Can you kind of give us a reason why you're so comfortable with opening up these large stores and what you see what maybe other people don't see?\n\n---\n\nWell, we've had good success with our marketplace format. It is driving a lot of our sales and growth right now. So really pleased with how they're performing, although we are still working on small-format stores. We're doing some work and research around that. So we're really trying to stay open to what's the customers looking for in terms of shopping experience. And so far, they've been really pleased with the selection that we have in the big store and we're really pleased with the results.\n\n---\n\nWhen we look at our Customer 1st tracker, customers can -- rate us very high in our marketplace stores. So it's really the things -- the combination of our associates and their connection with our customers and what we've put inside those boxes really connect well with the customer. And I realize 120,000 square feet, it depends on where you start from, it's a good-sized store but it's not so big that you can't manage getting around the store reasonably easy either. And it just gives you a lot of flexibility from a space utilization standpoint. And obviously, the key is making sure what you put in is exciting and something the customer wants.\n\n---\n\nWanted to ask a little bit more about Harris Teeter, if you guys can give further color in terms of the order online pick up at store capability that, obviously, was one of the big draws from Harris Teeter. Where are you in that process today? And any color that you can give in terms of, maybe, as you roll that capability out further?\n\n---\n\nIt's still pretty early in the process. I can tell you that our teams have spent a ton of energy, but it's not something that we are to a point of announcing publicly. But I can tell you, we're progressing along and we're very pleased with where we are and we're very pleased with the progress that Harris Teeter continues to make as well. I don't know, Mike, if you'd like to...\n\n---\n\nOn the -- in the Harris Teeter brand itself, has there been further rollout?\n\n---\n\nYes. Harris Teeter has continued to roll it out and they continue to have strong growth where they already have it. So it's really both pieces.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And just a quick follow-up, switching over to Vitacost. I know, obviously, also very early in the stages, but any color that you can give in terms of, when it was announced, you said that of the 45,000 SKUs that Vitacost carries, you had about 10,000 overlap. Any work that's been done so far that you can just kind of incrementally share in terms of maybe what some of those other products, when we may start to see them flowing onto the shelves throughout your banners, your other banners?\n\n---\n\nWell, again, we just really closed the transaction and we're right in the middle of putting plans together and going through all of the steps that you would during a merger of this sort and size and really trying to develop our plans for the future and how do we grow the platform, the Vitacost business. And we're learning a lot from Vitacost on what to do within the Kroger footprint also. So we're still in that discovery phase, but there is a lot going on and we're learning every day that there's more to learn.\n\n---\n\nFor Rodney or Mike and Mike, the guidance obviously implies a little bit of a slowdown in the ID sales x fuel in the back half. Can you guys just maybe talk about what -- why IDs would slow? Would it -- and maybe what some of the support was? Is your expectation of support from fuel rewards potentially slowing? Is there an expectation of less benefit from inflation? Or is there an expectation that tonnage could slow? Just sort of any color we should think about as far as your opportunity to continue to beat those ID guidance you're giving us.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Robert. First of all, obviously, we're going to strive to make sure the identicals are as strong as we can. If you remember, in the fourth quarter of last year, we had a lot of weather benefits. We didn't really talk about it that much in the earnings call, but there were quite a bit of weather benefits. Until you actually have it, you don't know whether it's going to be a headwind or a tailwind, so we're really -- the biggest reason for the conservatism in the identical guidance would be really cycling fourth quarter last year and not knowing how weather would be. It's really nothing -- you shouldn't read anything in it other than that. So we really don't see inflation changing that much. We really don't see the economy changing that much. We're not seeing the customer behavior changing either.\n\n---\n\nAnd then in terms of the sort of contribution from fuel rewards, has that been healthy? And is that expected to continue to incrementally support IDs as well?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's a great question and it's a little harder to answer because it's hard to isolate just one piece and what it does for identicals. It's really the whole shopping experience. So we continue to make progress on the freshness of our product. Our associates continue to make progress on connecting with our customers from a friendliness standpoint. So it's really hard to say this piece of improvement causes this much to the identicals. Overall, as you know, it's just one more reason for somebody to shop at Kroger and it's part of the overall package of what we're trying to deliver for our customer.\n\n---\n\nI was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about category performance. I think you mentioned a little bit on private label, but I think if I'm correct -- or correct me if I'm wrong, that you had been trending with all departments, kind of, in the positive territory? So just curious if you had any update on that.\n\n---\n\nIt was a well-rounded quarter. Corporate brands had a very nice quarter. If there was any hiccup at all and it's not even a hiccup but, obviously, the high dairy prices has an influence on how many units of milk wind up getting sold. So that was a bit of headwind on corporate brands because so much of the milk that we sell is processed in our own dairies. But tonnage, overall, was very, very strong. All departments had positive ID sales. All geographies had positive ID sales. And once again, natural foods would have been the leader in the departments, with continued double-digit ID sales growth in that department.\n\n---\n\nPharmacy was strong...\n\n---\n\nPharmacy was strong.\n\n---\n\nA lot of departments were strong.\n\n---\n\nGood broad-based performance.\n\n---\n\nMeat, produce, et cetera.\n\n---\n\nGreat. That's very helpful. And then just curious if you could elaborate a little bit on the science of the less cautious behavior that you're seeing and it sounds like most parts of your store. Is that more any trading-up activity? Is it more items you're seeing in the basket? Is it less focus on couponing and promotions? Or just any color you can provide would be helpful.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Well, it's as much an art as it is a science, but it's really looking at things that would be discretionary, what kind of performance are we having there. So if you think about Starbucks or Boar's Head, some of our cheeses, some of our upscale items, customers continue to engage in that in a much more positive way than before. And that's performance that's year-on-year. Also, if you look at some of the nonfood, general, jewelry, all those types of discretionary items, customers continue to be willing to spend money. And then we also survey our customers on their perception and customers are continuing to tell us they feel the economy is a little bit better, but they continue to be nervous in terms of their outlook on things. So it's cautious optimism, I think, is probably the best way to put it.\n\n---\n\nI have 2 questions, if I can. You slipped in a mention of D.C., Baltimore today. Can you update us on what your plan is for your expansion into new markets, where you're most focused? You're looking to hire 20,000 new permanent employees. Is that a sign you are getting closer to that? Or is that not the right way to look at the press release?\n\n---\n\nYes, I wouldn't say the 20,000 new hires really has anything to do with any announcement of going into new geography. Those are, by and large, almost entirely, if not incompletely, jobs that are open today in geographies where we already operate or have plans over the next year to open stores in existing geographies. So those are actual current needs we have to have to fully staff our stores at the level we want staffed and be able to have schedules written away. We need them written in our associates who want to work inside of our stores. We continue to think about our new market activity. A lot of activity going on around that, but we aren't going to be premature in announcing where that may be.\n\n---\n\nObviously, merging with Harris Teeter put us in a lot of new markets.\n\n---\n\nA lot of new markets. And relevant to the earlier question that I think John asked, we would expect, they're relatively new to D.C., Baltimore, so for Harris Teeter, those were new markets and there's significant opportunity to increase our footprint in those markets.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then the drought in California, it continues to become, I guess, more worrisome. So as you think about some of the fruits and nuts and so forth that you source from there, I mean, you look into next year, some of these items might be in shorter supply. Are you planning more differently than what you might usually do? Do you have options from other geographies if, I guess, certain items from the U.S. are harder to find? Or is it just too early to even think about that?\n\n---\n\nI think it's probably too early to think about that, although, we have the same sort of issue, whether it's orange juice from Florida or other commodities from around the world, that we'll have short supply from time to time and we just have to deal with that as best we can. And we buy from around the world in so many cases today, whether it's in the fresh departments or other parts of our business. So we just have to deal with that as it comes, I think.\n\n---\n\nSo your natural and organic sales growth has remained, obviously, pretty consistent here and strong. I'm curious how you're thinking today about this notion that the industry may be reaching a point where there's too much supply at retail for demand? Or do you think, instead, that the piece of the pie in terms of people interested in natural and organic is only continuing to broaden and deepen?\n\n---\n\nWell, it appears to us that the natural organic customer is changing and growing in numbers and those that shop the grocery store are also crossing over. And the blurring of grocery and natural foods is becoming more and more difficult when you look around the store and you can see organic items on the regular grocery shelf. So it seems that the customer base is getting much larger for these types of products. I don't know where the end is. I mean, it might be a lifestyle change for our customers that they're just deciding to eat better and make different choices for their families. But we love the growth and we're going to continue to make sure that we have the products our customers are looking for.\n\n---\n\nWe don't find that customer as an either/or shopper. There's a small percentage of customers that are only organic and natural, but most of our customer base actually buys across the whole store.\n\n---\n\nI guess that was my follow-up. Do you have any data that you can share on what percent of your customers are buying some natural or organics products today? And maybe how many just started over the past couple of years or maybe even what type of households were you seeing the most growth in the category in terms of whether it's middle incomes or upper middle incomes? Or anything that you can share on that would be really helpful.\n\n---\n\nIt would be well over half of our customers would buy something. That continues to increase. And the thing that I think is so hard is there's a lot of product innovation in that space as well, so some of the customers may be buying products there because of the innovation, not necessarily because of organic or natural. It's just because it's a new item and it tastes good. So how much of it is driven by one piece versus the other, I think it's pretty -- it'd be pure speculation.\n\n---\n\nInteresting. And anything in terms of the sort of household income profile, are you seeing that kind of dip down into middle incomes or where you're seeing kind of the most growth?\n\n---\n\nIt's really all customer types. It's not exclusive to one specific customer, by no means.\n\n---\n\nI actually have 2 questions this morning, if I may. First one is for Michael Schlotman. Michael, if I look at your outstanding debt, there's still a few items with high coupons. Can you maybe, conceptually, talk about how you think about liability management? And then, my question for Rodney is kind of a follow-up on an earlier question with regard to smaller store formats. We're obviously monitoring, with great interest, the Family Dollar saga. We're also monitoring what's going on in the U.K. market, where companies like Wm Morrison are now using convenience stores as a way to compete with the Aldis and the leaders of the world. Can you maybe just kind of talk a little bit more about how you think about the convenience store format? Is that something that, down the road, may be part of your plans? Or are you still very happy with your current portfolio?\n\n---\n\nYes, if you look at the smaller stores, obviously, we've been in the convenience store itself for years and years and years. I came to Kroger when we merged with Dillon. We would look at -- we are following Dollar General, Family Dollar every day as well. We consider both of them competitors. I can tell you all of us get into those stores on a regular basis, trying to learn what they do and how they connect with their customer and what are they doing good and what can we learn from them. And we think it will be important, over time, to have even a smaller store that's part of the profile, that's probably a convenient store and not necessarily a convenience store. But it's something we continue to work on. We haven't figured out how to make money the way we'd like to make money there, but we haven't given up either. Mike, do you want to talk about the debt?\n\n---\n\nYes, from a liability management standpoint, Filippe, we constantly look at some of those higher-coupon pieces of debt that are out there. Many of those are 30-year debt or what was 30-year debt at the time we issued it. When we look at the net present value of making a tender offer for those, it just doesn't often come out where it's an NPV positive on a cash flow basis. It may help accretion, it may be accretive to earnings per share on that basis, but the upfront amount you have to pay because of the premium that they'd be trading at, you wind up spending a lot of cash upfront. So we'll constantly look at it. I wouldn't say we have any plans in the near term to do anything about them and our approach has been, over time, to continue to manage our liability and have dollars coming due every year so we can be accessing the markets on a regular basis. We've actually taken a few hundred basis points out of our average interest portfolio. When we look at upcoming debt issuance activity, we do oftentimes enter into hedging agreements to lock in current interest rates in advance of actually issuing the debt. As we get closer to those, that is a type of transaction we often use.\n\n---\n\nYour comments that the recovery has not really been pervasive across the board, if you also look across the discounters that have not been showing strong grocery performance, it sounds like the weakness is really in that lowest income customer bracket. Is that true? And can you give us some insights on what's going on with that group? Are they just not responding to lower pricing at this point?\n\n---\n\nWell, I would say that we're very happy with how we're connecting with that customer. If you look at their economic situation, incomes have been very slow to recover and employment has been slow to recover. So it's really, when I make the comment, it's referring to the situation therein and we continue to try to make sure that we're able to address pricing and help their budget go further, both on the introduction of more entry price point items and, absolutely, just lowering pricing, too. So we're very happy with our performance for that customer segment, but that customer segment continues to be under a lot of economic strain.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then, switching over to store growth. You've done a lot of consolidation of underperforming stores in recent years and that's put some pressure on your net store growth. But it sounds like you're coming to some end of that process. Is there a square footage growth rate you can commit to in future years that's a little more robust?\n\n---\n\nYes, I incorrectly predicted last year that our asset, Harris Teeter, that our unit growth would expand a little bit. So I'll probably be hesitant to repeat that great prognostication here. Obviously, we've been very aggressive on trimming some of the underperforming assets in our portfolio, which has slowed our store count. The question earlier on, in Athens, Georgia, opening it up at 121,000 square feet, there are times -- that was not the case, but there are times where we open a store like that and then may replace a couple of 40,000 or 50,000 square foot stores. So our square footage actually goes up, but our store count goes down by 1 as a result. I think, going forward, our guidance has been in the range of a couple of percent of square footage growth excluding the operational closings and I don't want to get married to a square footage growth on a net basis and not make the right decision on operationally closing a store, so we kind of look at our investments in new, relocated and expanded stores separately from what activities should happen on operational closings and look at those separately. So we continue to increase capital. We'll increase it a couple of hundred million dollars next year. We expect to open up more stores next year than this year and I think it will be a continued progression up in both our store count and our square footage.\n\n---\n\nSo improving, but something under 2%, it sounds like.\n\n---\n\nOn a net basis, I would think so, yes. But Mark, keep in mind, that square footage is significantly more productive when you look at it on a sales per square footage basis. We're up roughly 50% on improvement in productivity in our stores since we started this Customer 1st journey 10 years ago. At the end of the day, I'd rather have more highly -- more productive square footage than more square footage that's a little less productive.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then lastly, as you're looking at click and collect and some of the other models, maybe if you can comment a little on some of these personal shopping services that are out there from third parties. Have you looked into Instacart, into Google Express and some of these other ones that are out there? What are your thoughts there?\n\n---\n\nYes, you should be very comfortable that we've looked at all of them and it's really trying to make sure we understand what our customers' wants and needs are. Some of the places where we believe that will be more successful are places where we don't have stores, but it is something we continue to look at and evaluate and look at partnering with, as appropriate.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to go back to comments about ROIC and the fact that there are a lot of investments, not just including Harris Teeter, but other investments that are dampening it now, but we will see improvement. And I was just wondering if you can give us a better sense of, not specific numbers, but kind of in terms of magnitude, whether we're talking about remodels, new stores and then a sense of how we should expect the benefits of those investments to flow in? Is it going to be 2015? Or is there more in 2016? Just how is that all going to work out?\n\n---\n\nYes, Meredith. If absent the Harris -- Harris Teeter being in there for a full year this year and if you think about how an ROIC calculation works and we started to go down this path in the conference call and took the language out, so I guess I'll go down on that in the Q&A. Right now, we only have half of the Harris Teeter assets in the calculation because it's the beginning of the year and end of the year average assets that your return is calculated on. So right now, it's about half year's of EBITDA and half of their assets. If you think about an ROIC number for Harris Teeter based on the purchase price, it would've been an ROIC number below what Kroger had been generating. So a full year of Harris Teeter in here will reset the bar for ROIC slightly. It won't be dramatically lower, but we do expect it to be a little bit lower. Absent that, even with the increased CapEx we've been investing in the business, we would've expected ROIC to grow slightly, albeit somewhat slowly as we ramped this up. You typically see a couple to 3-year lag and a better growth of ROIC as you begin to increase your capital expenditures. So we're about midway into that 2- to 3-year time frame. So sometime in '15, '16, we should start to see a bigger benefit from those investments we've made 18 months ago and are starting to mature now and they'll overwhelm the new investments we make in '15 and '16 from a return standpoint.\n\n---\n\nTypically, on expansions in these stores, Mike, the first year actually hurts ROIC.\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely.\n\n---\n\nThe second year, it gets almost neutral, but it hurts a little. Third year, it starts helping.\n\n---\n\nRight.\n\n---\n\nIf you look at the level of maturity.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And when you look at the performance of the projects that you've done, are they all following the pro formas that you had built? Are you -- do you feel like they're -- or are they beating them?\n\n---\n\nWell, it's like anything, all would be an overstatement of all hitting that or overperforming. It's a mixed bag. Some are a little below, some are exceeding it in a big way. But, by and large, most of them, many of them are right at the kind of expectations we laid out. The key there will be to continue to generate the sales and the EBITDA that those stores were expected to generate and then, in turn, hold our divisions accountable to give that EBITDA back to our shareholders and either back to us to continue to invest in the business or back to the shareholders so we can grow it. But clearly, as a group, these stores are performing very well and, I would say, are at a point right now of exceeding our expectations as a group.\n\n---\n\nAnd then my final question would be, is it right to think about this level of investment as being something that will continue? I know you don't want to talk about moving into a new market. Or should we see this as sort of opportunistic and we'll see a moderation in, say, '17?\n\n---\n\nI would not expect to see a moderation in the capital plans. We've got some great markets where we have average market shares or below average market shares when you look at some of our stronger markets. And the strong connection we see between market share and return on invested capital is one of the reasons we've gone down the fill-in strategy format. And I would expect to continue to see us have a very strong capital expenditure program. When we laid it out in 2012, we expected this to -- a couple of hundred million dollar increase for 5 years and it was going to start in '13. So that really gets you to the '17, '18 kind of time frame. And as we go through that process, we'll go through the report card like you just asked on the stores we've opened. And to the extent we continue to be happy with those investments as a group because, in the end, that's what affects our shareholders, is the group, we'll make ongoing decisions about how much we'll invest in capital. But based on where we are right now, I don't see any cause for pause.\n\n---\n\nSo as we -- I guess, just following up on Kate's questions earlier on natural and organics, you mentioned innovation as a big part of some of the growth you're seeing in the channel and the response from the consumer. Can you just provide a little bit more detail on the number of SKUs you've added in these categories, what additional rollouts are still planned and maybe, how much of the sales you think has been incremental? And then, kind of as a corollary there, how do you think about margin associated with this category versus other areas of the store?\n\n---\n\nWell, in terms of incremental, it's hard to say. There's a lot of switching that goes on today between natural and basic type of products. As we've mentioned, we expect our Simple Truth brand to be a $1 billion brand this year. So customers are as interested today and as engaged in natural and organic as they've ever been. Also, we don't talk a lot about organic produce, but that's a category that continues to grow. Could probably grow faster if supply was better, but we continue to enjoy large sales growth in that particular area.\n\n---\n\nAnd so just, again, on the -- I guess, any additional SKUs that you're planning to roll out on top of what you've done already? And also how you think about the margin in these categories, I guess, now and going forward?\n\n---\n\nSKU count continue to increase and the departments continue to grow in many cases, both on the private label side as well as the branded side. Margins, I'll tell you what, there's more margin pressure now on natural and organic than there's ever been. It seems that it's becoming more and more of a competitive category. And so although margins tend to be better in natural and organic, I don't know if that's going to continue for the foreseeable future.\n\n---\n\nBefore we end today's call, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge that this morning is the anniversary of the attacks of September 11. We all continue to mourn the loss of the brave men and women who perished on that tragic day. And I know that many of the folks on the call today were personally affected by those events. We continue to honor the memory of the fallen through our support of police, firefighters, the military and their families. On behalf of all of us here at Kroger, we want to say our heartfelt thank you to the everyday heroes who work every day to keep us all safe.\r\nFinally, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. September is Hunger Action Month and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our associates across the company who help support our customers and neighbors in need. According to our partners at Feeding America, the nation's largest hunger agency, there are 46.5 million Americans who don't know where their next meal will come from. Together, we are working to combat poverty, in partnership with 106 local Feeding America food banks. \r\nLast year alone, Kroger contributed the equivalent of 200 million, that's right, 200 million meals, nearly 4 million meals every week, to feed hungry families in our community, which I just find an amazing number and my hats off to our team.\r\nOf that, our Perishable Donations Partnership Program provided more than 50 million pounds of fresh meat, produce, dairy and bakery items directly to local food banks in 2013. Our associates play a vital role in helping us get this fresh, healthy food to those who need it most. Without your help and support, our Perishable Donations partnership would not be possible. Thank you.\r\nThat completes our call for today and thanks for joining us.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Steven Forbes (Analysts)】\nSo 2 questions. Number one, how much of the inflation that you saw in the quarter do you think actually passed through? Maybe, on a percent basis, did you pass 50% of it through or 75%? What's the general thought there? And then given your -- around your comments about the economy, I would think you probably could get a lot more of that pass-through here in the third quarter or is that not right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes, on your second question, I wouldn't necessarily agree or disagree with that. And as you know, inflation is -- you really do have to look at it item by item. And as Mike mentioned, even with the inflation, we still had strong tonnage growth and we're very happy with the results in total. A lot of the inflation right now is in some of the perishable areas, the fresh departments and that, as you know, is very seasonal. And if you look at, like, some of the produce inflation, as soon as the next crop comes on, that can heavily impact it. On percentage, I would hesitate to give it because in some areas, we feel comfortable we probably passed 100%, others, not so. And as you know, overall, as I mentioned, tonnage is strong. We continue to reduce our pricing for our customers as we take cost out of the business to do that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Forbes (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then, secondly, so if you think about Harris Teeter, how much scope is there for that organization to accelerate unit growth? I know there's a lot of potential for new stores, but -- and I don't know if that's spread out over more years, can they accelerate unit growth? And if they can't, if there's the capacity to do that, given the lead time on real estate, when would that be? Is that a '16 or '17 time frame or sooner?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nJohn, I think you'll see Harris Teeter have a little bit higher store growth over the next several years than they otherwise would have. They had a lot of projects in the pipeline as the 2 companies came together with the merger and the nice thing about joining Kroger for them is it gives them a little bit more capital capacity to be a little faster on getting some of those store projects up and running. It is true, in many of the markets they operate, where we have growth opportunities, the D.C. area, the Baltimore area, markets like that, the lead time is a little bit longer, but they've always had a very strong and forward-thinking capital plan. It's really just the ability now for them to accelerate some of those a little faster than they may have on their own. So we would expect that their unit growth will kick up from where it has been historically.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\n[indiscernible] average, the lead time is probably, what, 1 to 2 years longer than what we've been traditionally used to, unless you go to the West Coast.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nRight.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rupesh Parikh (Analysts)】\nSo I wanted to dive a little deeper into your expenses for the quarter. So compared to the past few quarters, we saw less expense leverage and I know you guys called out the more difficult comparison. Was there anything else that was unusual this quarter? And were the expenses in line with your internal plans?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, they were generally in line with our internal plans. The item that we called out in both -- well, that I just spoke of in the conference call, some increases in workers' comp and general liability reserves, a little bit of increase for this year, as well as some prior year increases in the allowances for that caused about an 8-basis-point negative effect on the OG&A lines. So we would've had a little bit better improvement or we would've shown some improvement if not for the need to increase those allowances. And I can tell you, that is certainly a point of focus for our operators and our loss prevention folks. The key to that isn't the dollars, it's making sure the accidents never happen.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rupesh Parikh (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then shifting to e-commerce, we've seen a lot more noise lately, whether it's from Amazon or Whole Foods and some of your competitors and you guys have clearly made investments with Vitacost. I mean, how do you feel about your current capabilities versus the competition right now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nIt's a good question. I would say we feel very good, but we're not satisfied. And the changes that we've made over the last couple of years, we feel increasingly happy about what we're seeing. As you know, it's one of the things when we merged with Harris Teeter that we were really excited about. They have an incredibly strong click and collect operation that we're spending a lot of time on. And as you know, when we announced merging with Vitacost, they have a great group of people from a talent perspective and a great infrastructure that we think we can grow off and expand. So I feel very comfortable where we are positioned from a food standpoint relative to our competition. I feel even more excited about some of the things that we've put in place to take advantage of the future. Mike or Mike, do you want to add to that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nNothing, other than the fact that the merger just closed a month ago and we are working hard to bring both companies together and see all the benefits we can come up with here.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nI just wanted to dive a little bit into gross margins. So obviously, there's been a lot of news and press about Harris Teeter taking prices down and it's hard to know how much that would've impacted your gross margins on your P&L. But by my math, your core FIFO margins, excluding Harris Teeter, could actually have been up this quarter. Is that a fair statement? And then, I guess, maybe talk about how generics might have impacted your gross margin and other points that might be relevant.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nRelative to Harris Teeter, I won't go to that level of transparency. Harris Teeter is not the only place that we continue to invest in price. They've -- it's been fairly public about the price reductions they've done and where they've done them, but we continue to refine our pricing strategy in all the geographies we operate. And our goal always remains to grow our operating profit margin on a rolling 4-quarter basis slightly. We were 7 basis points and I've never given a specific number, although Rodney and Cindy both pitted me a little bit yesterday that I've always said, \"By that, it's a handful or less,\" and most people can count how many digits are on both of my hands. And it would be only 1 hand, not 2. So that's why we said we actually exceeded that goal a little bit this time and that's what we always focus on. And when we get the operating leverage, we can accelerate things that we plan to do later. And if things aren't quite trending the way we want to grow operating profit margin, we can slow a few things down. We've become very nimble on that arena, which has been a huge help.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nOkay. So then, just on your quarter, in general, did you guys -- you guys came in above plan in the second quarter, is that fair to say? And then, I guess, it was ahead of plan on earnings. Was that more gas margin related? And I guess, I'm wondering because you didn't beat the Street by much, but your gross margins came in quite a bit higher and yet, you're raising your full year guidance on the low end by $0.03, so...\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nI think it's a combination of things, Karen. The strong sales, certainly, are encouraging for us and that momentum is always good. If you look at everything that has happened and the fact that we've increased our LIFO charge by what will amount to $0.05 or $0.06 more charge than we expected at the beginning of the year, we've now raised our earnings guidance twice, we've now raised our ID sales guidance. It's the combination of those factors that has allowed us to remain quite positive. While we only beat the Street by $0.01, LIFO cost us $0.01 and the 8 basis points from workers' comp and general liability would've been somewhere between $0.015 and $0.02, probably, at least, $0.02, depending on how things round. So despite those headwinds, the underlying strength of our core businesses, we're very happy with it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nAnd the top line strength has continued into the third quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes. So far, through the third quarter, it's very similar to where we were in the first and second quarters and I'm pleased with the continued progress.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nIf we look at the P&L just for the third quarter, are there any Vitacost acquisition expenses worth calling out, Mike?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWe haven't really called out any merger-related expenses for Harris Teeter for a while. We had some, actually leading up to the merger, there's been a few small ones out there, nothing amounting to much of anything, although a lot of the heavy lifting on -- as we convert systems and maybe happened to write some of the assets off of their books that they have capitalized as we convert to our systems. Those things might face us in the future. But those aren't cash expenditures, they're things that were spent in the past. And Vitacost is just so new. Sure, there was a handful of expenses leading up to the merger. While we used outside counsel, we didn't use an outside financial advisor, so it's not like we had any kind of a fee to pay a third party in that. So there really wasn't much at all.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nAnd then, in your guidance for the remainder of the year, Mike, how much dilution from Vitacost is built into that number?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nIt's negligible for the back half of the year and it's certainly contemplated in our guidance. They were actually operating here, very recently, at very close to a breakeven kind of a level. And we have a little bit of dilution built in, but nothing dramatic that we don't think we can overcome with the strength of the underlying operations.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Cerankosky (Analysts)】\nSo something like less than $0.05 per share?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, sir.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nLess than a handful of pennies.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nMost of my questions have been asked, but I just wanted to delve into the balance sheet. Mike, I know you talked about 2.33x and your 1.7x -- and I probably got the numbers all messed up, but you want to get them -- you want to get down to 2x. But clearly, there's been a lot of activity in the space. I just wonder, from your perspective, does your balance sheet right now preclude you from doing other things? Or would it -- it's a factor? Or how are you thinking about your balance sheet, given the fact that there's been so much activity in the space vis-à-vis M&A?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWe were 1.77x last year and we were at 2.33x this year, which was 9 basis points down from the first quarter. We feel very comfortable we're on track to get to the 2x to 2.2x. We'll be happy at the high-end of the range. We don't necessarily have to get to the 2.0x, Scott. That's just the range we winded up giving. I don't know that our balance sheet necessarily precludes us from doing anything. If the right opportunity is out there and we go to the rating agencies and they understand the uniqueness of an opportunity, like they clearly did with Harris Teeter, and our follow-through, when we make a commitment to them that we actually follow through on what we do, whether it's how we expect to grow the dividend, how we expect to use cash flow to buy in shares, how we expect to use capital to grow our business organically, we're very open with the rating agencies and follow through on the commitments we make. And if it's the right set of assets with the right growth opportunity, like Harris Teeter was with all the new markets, I don't think we would be precluded from continuing to participate in industry consolidation.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThe other thing is the 1.77x was unusually low because we had stopped buying back stocks and some other things because we had already announced the Harris Teeter merger and we wanted to position ourself well to being able to merge with Harris Teeter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nThat's an excellent point. We were actually out of the market on shares for quite a while, as we were blacked out while we were looking at it as well. So it was a combination of factors.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nThat's perfect. And if I could have one more. I think you guys recently opened up 121,000 square-foot in Athens, Georgia and I think the comments and what I've read is that there's a bigger one to come down there. You guys are really the only ones opening up bigger stores, even Walmart is shrinking what they're trying to do. Can you kind of give us a reason why you're so comfortable with opening up these large stores and what you see what maybe other people don't see?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nWell, we've had good success with our marketplace format. It is driving a lot of our sales and growth right now. So really pleased with how they're performing, although we are still working on small-format stores. We're doing some work and research around that. So we're really trying to stay open to what's the customers looking for in terms of shopping experience. And so far, they've been really pleased with the selection that we have in the big store and we're really pleased with the results.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWhen we look at our Customer 1st tracker, customers can -- rate us very high in our marketplace stores. So it's really the things -- the combination of our associates and their connection with our customers and what we've put inside those boxes really connect well with the customer. And I realize 120,000 square feet, it depends on where you start from, it's a good-sized store but it's not so big that you can't manage getting around the store reasonably easy either. And it just gives you a lot of flexibility from a space utilization standpoint. And obviously, the key is making sure what you put in is exciting and something the customer wants.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vincent Sinisi (Analysts)】\nWanted to ask a little bit more about Harris Teeter, if you guys can give further color in terms of the order online pick up at store capability that, obviously, was one of the big draws from Harris Teeter. Where are you in that process today? And any color that you can give in terms of, maybe, as you roll that capability out further?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nIt's still pretty early in the process. I can tell you that our teams have spent a ton of energy, but it's not something that we are to a point of announcing publicly. But I can tell you, we're progressing along and we're very pleased with where we are and we're very pleased with the progress that Harris Teeter continues to make as well. I don't know, Mike, if you'd like to...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vincent Sinisi (Analysts)】\nOn the -- in the Harris Teeter brand itself, has there been further rollout?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes. Harris Teeter has continued to roll it out and they continue to have strong growth where they already have it. So it's really both pieces.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vincent Sinisi (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And just a quick follow-up, switching over to Vitacost. I know, obviously, also very early in the stages, but any color that you can give in terms of, when it was announced, you said that of the 45,000 SKUs that Vitacost carries, you had about 10,000 overlap. Any work that's been done so far that you can just kind of incrementally share in terms of maybe what some of those other products, when we may start to see them flowing onto the shelves throughout your banners, your other banners?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nWell, again, we just really closed the transaction and we're right in the middle of putting plans together and going through all of the steps that you would during a merger of this sort and size and really trying to develop our plans for the future and how do we grow the platform, the Vitacost business. And we're learning a lot from Vitacost on what to do within the Kroger footprint also. So we're still in that discovery phase, but there is a lot going on and we're learning every day that there's more to learn.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nFor Rodney or Mike and Mike, the guidance obviously implies a little bit of a slowdown in the ID sales x fuel in the back half. Can you guys just maybe talk about what -- why IDs would slow? Would it -- and maybe what some of the support was? Is your expectation of support from fuel rewards potentially slowing? Is there an expectation of less benefit from inflation? Or is there an expectation that tonnage could slow? Just sort of any color we should think about as far as your opportunity to continue to beat those ID guidance you're giving us.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThanks, Robert. First of all, obviously, we're going to strive to make sure the identicals are as strong as we can. If you remember, in the fourth quarter of last year, we had a lot of weather benefits. We didn't really talk about it that much in the earnings call, but there were quite a bit of weather benefits. Until you actually have it, you don't know whether it's going to be a headwind or a tailwind, so we're really -- the biggest reason for the conservatism in the identical guidance would be really cycling fourth quarter last year and not knowing how weather would be. It's really nothing -- you shouldn't read anything in it other than that. So we really don't see inflation changing that much. We really don't see the economy changing that much. We're not seeing the customer behavior changing either.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nAnd then in terms of the sort of contribution from fuel rewards, has that been healthy? And is that expected to continue to incrementally support IDs as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes, it's a great question and it's a little harder to answer because it's hard to isolate just one piece and what it does for identicals. It's really the whole shopping experience. So we continue to make progress on the freshness of our product. Our associates continue to make progress on connecting with our customers from a friendliness standpoint. So it's really hard to say this piece of improvement causes this much to the identicals. Overall, as you know, it's just one more reason for somebody to shop at Kroger and it's part of the overall package of what we're trying to deliver for our customer.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kelly Bania (Analysts)】\nI was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about category performance. I think you mentioned a little bit on private label, but I think if I'm correct -- or correct me if I'm wrong, that you had been trending with all departments, kind of, in the positive territory? So just curious if you had any update on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nIt was a well-rounded quarter. Corporate brands had a very nice quarter. If there was any hiccup at all and it's not even a hiccup but, obviously, the high dairy prices has an influence on how many units of milk wind up getting sold. So that was a bit of headwind on corporate brands because so much of the milk that we sell is processed in our own dairies. But tonnage, overall, was very, very strong. All departments had positive ID sales. All geographies had positive ID sales. And once again, natural foods would have been the leader in the departments, with continued double-digit ID sales growth in that department.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nPharmacy was strong...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nPharmacy was strong.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nA lot of departments were strong.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nGood broad-based performance.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nMeat, produce, et cetera.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kelly Bania (Analysts)】\nGreat. That's very helpful. And then just curious if you could elaborate a little bit on the science of the less cautious behavior that you're seeing and it sounds like most parts of your store. Is that more any trading-up activity? Is it more items you're seeing in the basket? Is it less focus on couponing and promotions? Or just any color you can provide would be helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nOkay. Well, it's as much an art as it is a science, but it's really looking at things that would be discretionary, what kind of performance are we having there. So if you think about Starbucks or Boar's Head, some of our cheeses, some of our upscale items, customers continue to engage in that in a much more positive way than before. And that's performance that's year-on-year. Also, if you look at some of the nonfood, general, jewelry, all those types of discretionary items, customers continue to be willing to spend money. And then we also survey our customers on their perception and customers are continuing to tell us they feel the economy is a little bit better, but they continue to be nervous in terms of their outlook on things. So it's cautious optimism, I think, is probably the best way to put it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenneth Goldman (Analysts)】\nI have 2 questions, if I can. You slipped in a mention of D.C., Baltimore today. Can you update us on what your plan is for your expansion into new markets, where you're most focused? You're looking to hire 20,000 new permanent employees. Is that a sign you are getting closer to that? Or is that not the right way to look at the press release?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, I wouldn't say the 20,000 new hires really has anything to do with any announcement of going into new geography. Those are, by and large, almost entirely, if not incompletely, jobs that are open today in geographies where we already operate or have plans over the next year to open stores in existing geographies. So those are actual current needs we have to have to fully staff our stores at the level we want staffed and be able to have schedules written away. We need them written in our associates who want to work inside of our stores. We continue to think about our new market activity. A lot of activity going on around that, but we aren't going to be premature in announcing where that may be.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nObviously, merging with Harris Teeter put us in a lot of new markets.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nA lot of new markets. And relevant to the earlier question that I think John asked, we would expect, they're relatively new to D.C., Baltimore, so for Harris Teeter, those were new markets and there's significant opportunity to increase our footprint in those markets.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenneth Goldman (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then the drought in California, it continues to become, I guess, more worrisome. So as you think about some of the fruits and nuts and so forth that you source from there, I mean, you look into next year, some of these items might be in shorter supply. Are you planning more differently than what you might usually do? Do you have options from other geographies if, I guess, certain items from the U.S. are harder to find? Or is it just too early to even think about that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nI think it's probably too early to think about that, although, we have the same sort of issue, whether it's orange juice from Florida or other commodities from around the world, that we'll have short supply from time to time and we just have to deal with that as best we can. And we buy from around the world in so many cases today, whether it's in the fresh departments or other parts of our business. So we just have to deal with that as it comes, I think.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kate Wendt (Analysts)】\nSo your natural and organic sales growth has remained, obviously, pretty consistent here and strong. I'm curious how you're thinking today about this notion that the industry may be reaching a point where there's too much supply at retail for demand? Or do you think, instead, that the piece of the pie in terms of people interested in natural and organic is only continuing to broaden and deepen?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nWell, it appears to us that the natural organic customer is changing and growing in numbers and those that shop the grocery store are also crossing over. And the blurring of grocery and natural foods is becoming more and more difficult when you look around the store and you can see organic items on the regular grocery shelf. So it seems that the customer base is getting much larger for these types of products. I don't know where the end is. I mean, it might be a lifestyle change for our customers that they're just deciding to eat better and make different choices for their families. But we love the growth and we're going to continue to make sure that we have the products our customers are looking for.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWe don't find that customer as an either/or shopper. There's a small percentage of customers that are only organic and natural, but most of our customer base actually buys across the whole store.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kate Wendt (Analysts)】\nI guess that was my follow-up. Do you have any data that you can share on what percent of your customers are buying some natural or organics products today? And maybe how many just started over the past couple of years or maybe even what type of households were you seeing the most growth in the category in terms of whether it's middle incomes or upper middle incomes? Or anything that you can share on that would be really helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nIt would be well over half of our customers would buy something. That continues to increase. And the thing that I think is so hard is there's a lot of product innovation in that space as well, so some of the customers may be buying products there because of the innovation, not necessarily because of organic or natural. It's just because it's a new item and it tastes good. So how much of it is driven by one piece versus the other, I think it's pretty -- it'd be pure speculation.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kate Wendt (Analysts)】\nInteresting. And anything in terms of the sort of household income profile, are you seeing that kind of dip down into middle incomes or where you're seeing kind of the most growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nIt's really all customer types. It's not exclusive to one specific customer, by no means.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Filippe Goossens (Analysts)】\nI actually have 2 questions this morning, if I may. First one is for Michael Schlotman. Michael, if I look at your outstanding debt, there's still a few items with high coupons. Can you maybe, conceptually, talk about how you think about liability management? And then, my question for Rodney is kind of a follow-up on an earlier question with regard to smaller store formats. We're obviously monitoring, with great interest, the Family Dollar saga. We're also monitoring what's going on in the U.K. market, where companies like Wm Morrison are now using convenience stores as a way to compete with the Aldis and the leaders of the world. Can you maybe just kind of talk a little bit more about how you think about the convenience store format? Is that something that, down the road, may be part of your plans? Or are you still very happy with your current portfolio?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes, if you look at the smaller stores, obviously, we've been in the convenience store itself for years and years and years. I came to Kroger when we merged with Dillon. We would look at -- we are following Dollar General, Family Dollar every day as well. We consider both of them competitors. I can tell you all of us get into those stores on a regular basis, trying to learn what they do and how they connect with their customer and what are they doing good and what can we learn from them. And we think it will be important, over time, to have even a smaller store that's part of the profile, that's probably a convenient store and not necessarily a convenience store. But it's something we continue to work on. We haven't figured out how to make money the way we'd like to make money there, but we haven't given up either. Mike, do you want to talk about the debt?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, from a liability management standpoint, Filippe, we constantly look at some of those higher-coupon pieces of debt that are out there. Many of those are 30-year debt or what was 30-year debt at the time we issued it. When we look at the net present value of making a tender offer for those, it just doesn't often come out where it's an NPV positive on a cash flow basis. It may help accretion, it may be accretive to earnings per share on that basis, but the upfront amount you have to pay because of the premium that they'd be trading at, you wind up spending a lot of cash upfront. So we'll constantly look at it. I wouldn't say we have any plans in the near term to do anything about them and our approach has been, over time, to continue to manage our liability and have dollars coming due every year so we can be accessing the markets on a regular basis. We've actually taken a few hundred basis points out of our average interest portfolio. When we look at upcoming debt issuance activity, we do oftentimes enter into hedging agreements to lock in current interest rates in advance of actually issuing the debt. As we get closer to those, that is a type of transaction we often use.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Wiltamuth (Analysts)】\nYour comments that the recovery has not really been pervasive across the board, if you also look across the discounters that have not been showing strong grocery performance, it sounds like the weakness is really in that lowest income customer bracket. Is that true? And can you give us some insights on what's going on with that group? Are they just not responding to lower pricing at this point?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, I would say that we're very happy with how we're connecting with that customer. If you look at their economic situation, incomes have been very slow to recover and employment has been slow to recover. So it's really, when I make the comment, it's referring to the situation therein and we continue to try to make sure that we're able to address pricing and help their budget go further, both on the introduction of more entry price point items and, absolutely, just lowering pricing, too. So we're very happy with our performance for that customer segment, but that customer segment continues to be under a lot of economic strain.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Wiltamuth (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then, switching over to store growth. You've done a lot of consolidation of underperforming stores in recent years and that's put some pressure on your net store growth. But it sounds like you're coming to some end of that process. Is there a square footage growth rate you can commit to in future years that's a little more robust?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, I incorrectly predicted last year that our asset, Harris Teeter, that our unit growth would expand a little bit. So I'll probably be hesitant to repeat that great prognostication here. Obviously, we've been very aggressive on trimming some of the underperforming assets in our portfolio, which has slowed our store count. The question earlier on, in Athens, Georgia, opening it up at 121,000 square feet, there are times -- that was not the case, but there are times where we open a store like that and then may replace a couple of 40,000 or 50,000 square foot stores. So our square footage actually goes up, but our store count goes down by 1 as a result. I think, going forward, our guidance has been in the range of a couple of percent of square footage growth excluding the operational closings and I don't want to get married to a square footage growth on a net basis and not make the right decision on operationally closing a store, so we kind of look at our investments in new, relocated and expanded stores separately from what activities should happen on operational closings and look at those separately. So we continue to increase capital. We'll increase it a couple of hundred million dollars next year. We expect to open up more stores next year than this year and I think it will be a continued progression up in both our store count and our square footage.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Wiltamuth (Analysts)】\nSo improving, but something under 2%, it sounds like.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nOn a net basis, I would think so, yes. But Mark, keep in mind, that square footage is significantly more productive when you look at it on a sales per square footage basis. We're up roughly 50% on improvement in productivity in our stores since we started this Customer 1st journey 10 years ago. At the end of the day, I'd rather have more highly -- more productive square footage than more square footage that's a little less productive.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Wiltamuth (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then lastly, as you're looking at click and collect and some of the other models, maybe if you can comment a little on some of these personal shopping services that are out there from third parties. Have you looked into Instacart, into Google Express and some of these other ones that are out there? What are your thoughts there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes, you should be very comfortable that we've looked at all of them and it's really trying to make sure we understand what our customers' wants and needs are. Some of the places where we believe that will be more successful are places where we don't have stores, but it is something we continue to look at and evaluate and look at partnering with, as appropriate.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nI wanted to go back to comments about ROIC and the fact that there are a lot of investments, not just including Harris Teeter, but other investments that are dampening it now, but we will see improvement. And I was just wondering if you can give us a better sense of, not specific numbers, but kind of in terms of magnitude, whether we're talking about remodels, new stores and then a sense of how we should expect the benefits of those investments to flow in? Is it going to be 2015? Or is there more in 2016? Just how is that all going to work out?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, Meredith. If absent the Harris -- Harris Teeter being in there for a full year this year and if you think about how an ROIC calculation works and we started to go down this path in the conference call and took the language out, so I guess I'll go down on that in the Q&A. Right now, we only have half of the Harris Teeter assets in the calculation because it's the beginning of the year and end of the year average assets that your return is calculated on. So right now, it's about half year's of EBITDA and half of their assets. If you think about an ROIC number for Harris Teeter based on the purchase price, it would've been an ROIC number below what Kroger had been generating. So a full year of Harris Teeter in here will reset the bar for ROIC slightly. It won't be dramatically lower, but we do expect it to be a little bit lower. Absent that, even with the increased CapEx we've been investing in the business, we would've expected ROIC to grow slightly, albeit somewhat slowly as we ramped this up. You typically see a couple to 3-year lag and a better growth of ROIC as you begin to increase your capital expenditures. So we're about midway into that 2- to 3-year time frame. So sometime in '15, '16, we should start to see a bigger benefit from those investments we've made 18 months ago and are starting to mature now and they'll overwhelm the new investments we make in '15 and '16 from a return standpoint.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nTypically, on expansions in these stores, Mike, the first year actually hurts ROIC.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nAbsolutely.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThe second year, it gets almost neutral, but it hurts a little. Third year, it starts helping.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nRight.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nIf you look at the level of maturity.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nOkay. And when you look at the performance of the projects that you've done, are they all following the pro formas that you had built? Are you -- do you feel like they're -- or are they beating them?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWell, it's like anything, all would be an overstatement of all hitting that or overperforming. It's a mixed bag. Some are a little below, some are exceeding it in a big way. But, by and large, most of them, many of them are right at the kind of expectations we laid out. The key there will be to continue to generate the sales and the EBITDA that those stores were expected to generate and then, in turn, hold our divisions accountable to give that EBITDA back to our shareholders and either back to us to continue to invest in the business or back to the shareholders so we can grow it. But clearly, as a group, these stores are performing very well and, I would say, are at a point right now of exceeding our expectations as a group.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nAnd then my final question would be, is it right to think about this level of investment as being something that will continue? I know you don't want to talk about moving into a new market. Or should we see this as sort of opportunistic and we'll see a moderation in, say, '17?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nI would not expect to see a moderation in the capital plans. We've got some great markets where we have average market shares or below average market shares when you look at some of our stronger markets. And the strong connection we see between market share and return on invested capital is one of the reasons we've gone down the fill-in strategy format. And I would expect to continue to see us have a very strong capital expenditure program. When we laid it out in 2012, we expected this to -- a couple of hundred million dollar increase for 5 years and it was going to start in '13. So that really gets you to the '17, '18 kind of time frame. And as we go through that process, we'll go through the report card like you just asked on the stores we've opened. And to the extent we continue to be happy with those investments as a group because, in the end, that's what affects our shareholders, is the group, we'll make ongoing decisions about how much we'll invest in capital. But based on where we are right now, I don't see any cause for pause.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Grambling (Analysts)】\nSo as we -- I guess, just following up on Kate's questions earlier on natural and organics, you mentioned innovation as a big part of some of the growth you're seeing in the channel and the response from the consumer. Can you just provide a little bit more detail on the number of SKUs you've added in these categories, what additional rollouts are still planned and maybe, how much of the sales you think has been incremental? And then, kind of as a corollary there, how do you think about margin associated with this category versus other areas of the store?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nWell, in terms of incremental, it's hard to say. There's a lot of switching that goes on today between natural and basic type of products. As we've mentioned, we expect our Simple Truth brand to be a $1 billion brand this year. So customers are as interested today and as engaged in natural and organic as they've ever been. Also, we don't talk a lot about organic produce, but that's a category that continues to grow. Could probably grow faster if supply was better, but we continue to enjoy large sales growth in that particular area.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Grambling (Analysts)】\nAnd so just, again, on the -- I guess, any additional SKUs that you're planning to roll out on top of what you've done already? And also how you think about the margin in these categories, I guess, now and going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nSKU count continue to increase and the departments continue to grow in many cases, both on the private label side as well as the branded side. Margins, I'll tell you what, there's more margin pressure now on natural and organic than there's ever been. It seems that it's becoming more and more of a competitive category. And so although margins tend to be better in natural and organic, I don't know if that's going to continue for the foreseeable future.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nBefore we end today's call, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge that this morning is the anniversary of the attacks of September 11. We all continue to mourn the loss of the brave men and women who perished on that tragic day. And I know that many of the folks on the call today were personally affected by those events. We continue to honor the memory of the fallen through our support of police, firefighters, the military and their families. On behalf of all of us here at Kroger, we want to say our heartfelt thank you to the everyday heroes who work every day to keep us all safe.\r\nFinally, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. September is Hunger Action Month and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our associates across the company who help support our customers and neighbors in need. According to our partners at Feeding America, the nation's largest hunger agency, there are 46.5 million Americans who don't know where their next meal will come from. Together, we are working to combat poverty, in partnership with 106 local Feeding America food banks. \r\nLast year alone, Kroger contributed the equivalent of 200 million, that's right, 200 million meals, nearly 4 million meals every week, to feed hungry families in our community, which I just find an amazing number and my hats off to our team.\r\nOf that, our Perishable Donations Partnership Program provided more than 50 million pounds of fresh meat, produce, dairy and bakery items directly to local food banks in 2013. Our associates play a vital role in helping us get this fresh, healthy food to those who need it most. Without your help and support, our Perishable Donations partnership would not be possible. Thank you.\r\nThat completes our call for today and thanks for joining us.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's Fiscal 2015 First Quarter Results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website, investors.nikeinc.com.\r\nJoining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker; followed by Trevor Edwards, President of the NIKE Brand; and finally, you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions]\r\nI will now turn the call over to Nike Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone. Our Q1 results demonstrate that NIKE is, without a doubt, a growth company. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 15% to $8 billion, gross margin expanded 170 basis points and diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $1.09.\r\nOn previous calls, I've highlighted 3 of NIKE's distinct competitive advantages: our relationship with athletes and consumers; our ability to innovate; and the power of our portfolio. Those advantages are the foundation for the Q1 results we just reported and the competitive separation we're driving in the marketplace.\r\nFirst, our relationship with athletes and consumers are unparalleled. By relentlessly focusing on what they want and need, we propel our business forward. We use the insights we gained to deliver the products, services and experience athletes and consumers want. The lens we use to focus these relationships is our category offense, and the power of that approach is most clearly seen during global sports moments like the World Cup. These events provide us with the opportunity to showcase our most innovative products as the world's greatest athletes inspire us with their performance and their passion. They also create tremendous energy throughout the year, as we leverage these innovations and athletes' stories to deliver compelling products and experiences to consumers through their favorite sport.\r\nAs I think about the evolving consumer landscape, there are a number of trends that play to NIKE's strengths. The middle class is growing around the world, interest in sport continues to grow, and consumers are investing more and more in their own health and fitness. Apparel and footwear styles are becoming increasingly athletic. Because we know the consumer better than anyone else, we're able to leverage these developments to accelerate our growth. The result, we turn trends into real business momentum.\r\nSecond, let's talk about innovation. At the heart of our ability to achieve long-term growth is our unrivaled ability to innovate. NIKE delivers impressive innovations because we develop ever-sharper insights from athletes and consumers and we harness the power of new technologies, designs and materials. Our capabilities today are greater than they've ever been. Our challenge is to edit and focus those capabilities on the most significant opportunities. And when we do this effectively, we accelerate the pace of innovation, we create competitive separation and we deliver results like we did in Q1.\r\nIn just the past 90 days, we've demonstrated the versatility and potential of our advanced Flyknit technologies, with products in running, global football, basketball and most recently, football in the U.S. The consumer benefits are incredible, and looking ahead, I know the potential for this is significantly increasing the scope and scale this technology is very, very real. We set new levels of performance in apparel with products such as the NIKE Dri-FIT rain jacket, the NIKE Pro collection and the further extension of our Dri-FIT Knit, and collections like Nike Tech Fleece continue to drive growth and distinction by leveraging technical performance features into premium sportswear apparel.\r\nWe launched the Air Jordan XX9, our lightest Jordan ever, bringing a new level of basketball performance to the Jordan brand. And just last week, we expanded the potential of our Zoom Air technology with the launch of the LeBron 12. We have some very ambitious plans for this signature Air technology. I can't tell you much more now but I will say that the LeBron 12 is just the beginning of the revolution.\r\nIt's important to understand that NIKE's innovation agenda goes beyond product. It touches everything we do. One example is how we're leveraging the power of digital. The digital world moves fast, and NIKE is at the forefront. We're employing new ways to engage consumers online as we create communities, services and e-commerce experiences that fuel our growth strategies around the world. These strategies are strengthening our relationships with consumers and driving our business, as e-commerce revenues were up over 70% in the first quarter.\r\nGoing forward, we will innovate at an increasingly rapid pace. We are a growth company because we are an innovation company. That is why we are committed to sustained investment in this area. We know it fuels top and bottom line expansion and drives value for our shareholders. And when I look at our innovation pipeline, I see innovations that will, no doubt, surprise and delight. Innovations that are better for athletes, consumers and the planet. I couldn't be more excited about what's coming.\r\nThe final competitive advantage I want to highlight is the power of NIKE's portfolio. It's a complete offense that encompasses brands, geographies, categories, product types and channels. When all of these components are working together, the portfolio generates amazing growth. And when we double and triple click into the various dimensions of our business, we see even more potential.\r\nThe diversity within our portfolio is a tremendous competitive advantage. It allows us to thrive in a rapidly changing environment, create separation and ultimately, expand the market. Trevor will discuss the NIKE Brand's outstanding Q1 results in more detail, but let me give you 3 highlights from my point of view.\r\nOne, the NIKE Brand is strongly resonating with consumers around the world. We're delivering robust growth and profitability at some of our largest geographies, maintaining momentum in North America, accelerating growth in Western Europe and turning the corner with strong results in China.\r\nTwo, our category offense is accelerating growth. Our largest performance businesses, Running, Basketball and Global Football, continue to expand. Sportswear grew at a strong double-digit rate, and our Women's and Young Athletes businesses grew rapidly, in fact, faster than our Men's business.\r\nAnd three, we're driving growth across an integrated marketplace. DTC revenues grew over 30% in the quarter, and our wholesale business grew double digits, reflecting strong growth in stores and online.\r\nI've said that becoming a better retailer would make us a better wholesale partner. And our Q1 results are only the beginning. We have been extremely thoughtful about the investments we've made against our biggest growth opportunities across the portfolio. From accelerated product innovation to enhanced consumer experiences to sharply focused retail executions. It's the integration of complementary strategies and investments that leads to an acceleration of growth. And we will continue to make strategic investments to drive growth for years to come.\r\nI'm tremendously proud of our Q1 results, the momentum and our management team's ability to seize opportunities and manage risk. At the same time, I've never been more excited about the potential to raise the bar even higher in the future. Thank you. And now, here's Trevor.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Mark. I'm also very proud of the results we reported for Q1. On a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 15%, with growth across all 6 geographies and nearly every key category. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 30%, driven by comp store growth of 15%, new store expansion and accelerated growth in online sales, up 70%. And global futures are a robust 14%. The great results we're reporting today clearly demonstrate the success of our vital growth strategy, the category offense. The power of the category offense is unleashed when NIKE works with our wholesale partners to develop an integrated marketplace. This happens when we have the right product at the right time, presented in a way that clearly differentiates the NIKE Brand to consumers.\r\nA key component of this offense is our own DTC business, which is an important complement to the wholesale business around the globe. As I said, we delivered impressive growth in the quarter, with expansion in all 3 DTC concepts: in line, factory stores and NIKE.com.\r\nOur investments in DTC as a strategic driver are clearly paying off, and we continue to see even greater potential ahead, and we're investing to create compelling presentations with our wholesale partners around the world as we expand the potential of the NIKE Brand in a holistic and integrated marketplace.\r\nAt NIKE, we earn our place with consumers every day. The World Cup is a great example of how we harness the power of sport to deepen the relationship between consumers and the NIKE Brand. We introduced more revolutionary product innovations in this World Cup than in any prior, and we're proud of the fact that more players wore Nike boots on the pitch than all other brands combined. Nearly 1/3 of those players were Flyknit boots. That's amazing.\r\nWe delivered products to consumers in compelling retail experiences all over the world, from our first football-only store in Copacabana, Brazil, to NIKETOWNs in London and New York to football-focused executions with our wholesale partners around the world.\r\nWith great football products, compelling retail presentation and strong consumer engagement, we drove great results. All told, Global Football revenue grew at a strong double-digit rate in Q1. And as of the end of the quarter, we have the leading footwear market share in the 9 largest football markets around the world.\r\nNext, I'd like to highlight Running. Our relentless drive to serve our athletes gives us an unmatched ability to meet their needs as they compete, train and express themselves. Our Q1 results demonstrate this with double-digit revenue growth, driven by premium footwear and apparel.\r\nIn footwear, the Pegasus 31, the LunarGlide 6 and the Free Flyknit have also sold through exceptionally well. In apparel, our Dri-FIT Knit, with its seamless construction and comfortable fit, has continued to resonate with consumers. And in sportswear, we continue to showcase our deep heritage with products like the Air Max Lunar1, the Nike Tech Windrunner jacket, which delivered strong results.\r\nLike the athletes we serve, we look for ways to continually improve. We see tremendous growth opportunities for Running around the globe, and we look forward to another season of great events starting this fall with the Nike Women's Half \t\t\tMarathon in San Francisco, followed by marathons from Chicago to Amsterdam to Shanghai.\r\nNow I'd like to talk about our Women's business, which continued to grow faster than Men's. Q1 revenue for Women's grew at a strong double-digit pace as we focus on realizing the significant potential in this large and growing business. It all starts by engaging and inspiring consumers, and here are some key examples.\r\nThe Nike+ Training Club has been downloaded nearly 17 million times and has become a personal trainer for women around the world. And we're also inspiring women with live experiences every day. 70,000 members participate in Nike Run Clubs across the globe and more are joining daily.\r\nWe also lead the women's market by continuing to deliver innovative products such as the performance footwear for the gym like the Nike Free Trainer 4.0; premium apparel such as the Nike's sculp tights and the Nike Pro Bra Collection, which saw exceptional sell-through; and iconic franchises that remain incredibly popular like our Air Max footwear and Sportswear Tech Pack apparel.\r\nLastly, we serve these consumers in increasingly dynamic retail environments. We're experiencing tremendous growth online, led by NIKE.com, and in-store, driven by sharper assortments and the continued expansion of the Nike Training Club concept to in-line stores. And our printed and digital style guides are a key accelerator leading to increased conversion. All told, it is this complete offense that's driving impressive results for our Women's business.\r\nLet me now turn to a few of our key geographies. First, Western Europe, where our incredible business momentum continued into the first quarter, with revenues up 25%. Our revenue growth was broad-based, with every key category and territory reporting double-digit growth. There is tremendous energy around the brand in Europe, with innovative products that are resonating with consumers. We saw strong results from both performance footwear and apparel as well as in sportswear.\r\nA critical component to unlocking this growth is the work we've done in the marketplace. By creating category-specific retail destinations with partners like JD Sports, Foot Locker and Intersport, we have differentiated the NIKE Brand with consumers. We also leveraged our own DTC business, including NIKE.com, as a key component of a segmented marketplace.\r\nWe continue to evolve our DTC strategy, and the market share gains in nearly every territory send a strong signal that our efforts are working.\r\nNext, the emerging markets, where revenues increased 10% in the quarter, with most territories growing in Q1.\r\nIn Brazil, the World Cup was a tremendous success for the NIKE Brand. Our ability to connect with consumers was unmatched, and our enthusiasm for the long-term potential of this critical market remains unchanged. That said, the recent weakening of the Brazilian economy requires us to carefully manage the marketplace to keep it healthy and productive for NIKE and our retail partners. While we are not immune to macro conditions, we are focused on maintaining strong brand momentum and deepening consumer connections as we work to elevate the marketplace for continued growth.\r\nIn Mexico, as discussed in previous quarters, distribution challenges led to an inconsistent flow of product into the marketplace. While the NIKE Brand continues to resonate with consumers, inventory levels at retail are higher than we would like given the slower sell-through in certain channels. In response, we are carefully managing the flow of product into the marketplace. At the same time, we are working with our wholesale partners to clear excess inventory already in the market. This is to ensure a healthy pull market in Mexico for the long term.\r\nBy staying closely attuned to consumer and marketplace dynamics, we seize opportunities and address challenges as they arise. Overall, we continue to see tremendous potential for long-term profitable growth in the emerging markets.\r\nIn Greater China, we continue to see strength in the NIKE Brand and positive near-term results from our actions to sharpen our product assortments and reset the marketplace. Revenues grew 20% in the quarter, led by 30% comp store growth in our own DTC doors. At the same time, partner doors that have been reset continued to outpace the rest of the fleet, delivering greater productivity and profitability.\r\nAs we continue to deliver innovative products and compelling experiences to consumers and reset additional retail locations, we are confident we can deliver double-digit long-term growth in this key market.\r\nAnd finally, North America continues to be a growth driver for the company, with Q1 revenues up 12%. North America is a clear example of the incredible results we can drive with the category offense across an integrated marketplace. We saw growth in nearly every dimension of our business, wholesale and DTC, in-line, factory and online, in nearly all key categories and across our Men's, Women's and Young Athletes businesses. The category offense is unlocking new areas of growth in North America by serving unique consumer segments. The more we focus and separate ourselves, the more potential we discover in our largest geography.\r\nUltimately, the strategies we have deployed around the world are working, as the investments we have made are yielding tremendous results. I am proud of the accomplishments, and I'm excited about the opportunities as the momentum of our business continues to accelerate. To put it simply, Q1 was a great quarter and we're just getting started. \r\nThanks. Now here's Don.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Trevor. The outstanding results we delivered in Q1 continue to demonstrate the strength of the NIKE portfolio, exceeding the expectations we set only 90 days ago. As Mark discussed, these results are the product of aligned strategies and disciplined investment, creating a virtuous cycle, focused investments that deliver strong returns, fueling near-term growth and additional investments.\r\nAs our Q1 results demonstrate, our strategies are delivering great returns, and we'll continue to make targeted investments to drive long-term profitable growth.\r\nThe growth in Q1 was powered by our largest businesses. When our largest businesses have momentum, we're able to deliver the level of growth and profit leverage we are reporting today. We saw double-digit revenue expansion in each of our largest geographies, notably North America, Western Europe and China, driven by deeper and more tailored execution of our category offense in each market. Growth in these geographies accelerated in the quarter, and profitability grew faster than revenues.\r\nOur Q1 growth was broad-based across categories, with particular strengths in our largest performance category such as Basketball, Running and Global Football, as well as in Sportswear.\r\nWhile every product type reported higher revenues for the quarter, we posted 18% growth in Footwear, our largest and most profitable business. And while we delivered double-digit growth in wholesale revenues, DTC grew even faster.\r\nWith that introduction, I'll now recap our Q1 results.\r\nNIKE, Inc. first quarter revenue grew 15% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis. NIKE Brand revenue increased 15%, and Converse revenue increased 16%. NIKE Brand futures orders grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by a 9% increase in units and a 5% increase in average selling price. The increase was led by double-digit growth in North America and both European geographies, including strong growth in Sportswear, Basketball, Running and Women's Training.\r\nOn a reported basis, futures grew 11%, reflecting weaker international currencies, particularly in Japan, Argentina, Russia and Turkey.\r\nFirst quarter diluted EPS increased 27% to $1.09, driven by strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by increased SG&A investments. EPS also benefited from a lower tax rate and reduced share count, which together accounted for about 9 points of EPS growth.\r\nGross margin increased 170 basis points in the quarter, driven by higher average selling prices, a mix shift to higher-margin products, the continued strength of our DTC business and a modest FX tailwind. Gross margin also benefited from a mix shift to higher-margin geographies. These upsides more than offset downward pressure from product input cost inflation.\r\nGross margin for the quarter was better than expected, primarily due to a more significant mix shift to higher-margin products and geographies as well as stronger revenue growth in our DTC business.\r\nDriven primarily by World Cup marketing, Q1 demand creation increased 23%, lower growth than we projected 90 days ago. As Trevor noted earlier, our World Cup marketing in Q1 was highly effective driving energy around the world and across categories. As a result, we decided to shift some demand-creation investment to the balance of the year to support upcoming brand and product initiatives.\r\nOperating overhead grew 19% in Q1, reflecting investments in DTC, digital innovations and infrastructure.\r\nOther expense, net, was $3 million for the quarter, down significantly from Q1 of FY '14 when exchange rate movements in developing markets led to significant currency conversion losses. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 21.7%, better than expected due to the resolution of tax audits in several jurisdictions and an increase in earnings from operations outside the U.S., which are generally subject to a lower tax rate.\r\nOur return on invested capital continues to be strong as ROIC reached 26.2%, 70 basis points above last year. Inventories at August 31 were up 14% year-on-year and remain healthy overall, with the majority of the growth driven by North America and Europe as well as the expansion of our DTC business around the world. Our primary areas of focus for inventory management are Brazil and Mexico, where we continue to balance supply and demand to position those markets for ongoing growth.\r\nNow let's take a look at our performance by segment. In North America, Q1 revenue increased 12% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Basketball, Women's Training and Global Football. For the quarter, footwear revenue increased 15% while apparel grew 10%. Direct to Consumer revenues increased 22% in Q1, driven by 11% comp store sales growth and significantly higher NIKE.com revenues. On a reported basis, Q1 EBIT for North America grew 19% due to strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion.\r\nFor Q1, Western Europe revenue grew 25% on a currency-neutral basis, with double-digit growth across all territories and categories. As both Mark and Trevor discussed, we're very pleased with the results of our work to develop an integrated marketplace with engaging, differentiated retail presentations. Both DTC and wholesale revenues advanced strongly for the quarter.\r\nOn a reported basis for Q1, Western Europe revenue increased 32% while EBIT jumped 52%, driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion as well as the translation benefit of a stronger euro.\r\nIn Central and Eastern Europe, currency-neutral revenues rose 9% with growth across all key categories except Action Sports and all territories except Russia and Israel. We continue to closely monitor the situation in these markets and remain focused on the things we control, building strong consumer connections, leading with innovative products and managing a healthy marketplace.\r\nOverall, we're pleased with our results in CEE and remain confident in these geographies' growth prospects.\r\nOn a reported basis, revenue for CEE grew 7% but EBIT declined 16%, reflecting FX headwinds, particularly in Russia, lower gross margins and SG&A investments to support the World Cup.\r\nIn Greater China, currency-neutral revenue grew 20% for the quarter, with double-digit growth in our 3 largest categories: Sportswear, Basketball and Running. As Trevor discussed, we're seeing the results of our strategies to sharpen our product assortments and reset the marketplace.\r\nOn a reported basis for Q1, China revenue rose 18%, while EBIT grew 28% as higher revenues and gross margin expansion more than offset the impact of SG&A investments in DTC and our new Shanghai campus.\r\nOn our last earnings call, we projected revenues in China to grow at a somewhat faster rate in Q1 than for the full year due to changes in seasonal product flow and significant variations in prior year comparisons. Q1 growth was even stronger than we expected due to higher DTC revenue growth and at-once sales. We expect these trends to continue driving FY '15 revenue growth for China to a low to mid-teens rate, with the growth heavily weighted to the first half.\r\nIn the emerging markets, currency-neutral revenues increased 10%, reflecting revenue growth in every territory except Mexico and our Latin American distributors. From a category perspective, the growth was led by double-digit growth in Sportswear, Running, Global Football, Basketball and Women's Training. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue for the emerging markets grew 4% but EBIT declined 26% as a result of marketing investments in the World Cup and FX headwinds in a number of markets.\r\nWe remain confident in the significant growth potential of this geography. And as Trevor discussed, we're focused on doing the right things now to evolve these developing marketplaces and further strengthen our brand to generate sustainable, profitable growth for years to come.\r\nFirst quarter revenue for Converse increased 16% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, driven by market conversions in Europe and Asia as well as continued growth in direct distribution markets such as the U.S. and the U.K.\r\nEBIT increased 10% for the quarter as revenue growth was partially offset by investments in DTC and infrastructure to support the brand's long-term growth and profitability.\r\nWe entered FY '15 with tremendous brand and business momentum that drove outstanding Q1 financial results. Our updated FY '15 guidance reflects continued momentum over the remainder of the year, fueling strong growth in revenue and EPS as well as enabling continued investments for sustainable, profitable growth.\r\nFor revenue, we now expect constant dollar growth for Q2 and full year in the low double digits. This accelerated growth reflects robust consumer demand in our largest markets and categories, with particular strength in our DTC business. Our current outlook for reported revenue growth is 1 to 2 points lower, reflecting the stronger dollar. We now expect gross margin for Q2 to expand by 125 to 150 basis points. This is above our prior expectations as our strategies to increase average selling prices continue and growth in our higher-margin businesses, including DTC, continue to accelerate.\r\nThese benefits will help to offset increases in product input costs, particularly labor, and our actions to clear excess inventory in the emerging markets geography.\r\nIn addition, given current exchange rates, we expect FX will have a neutral impact on gross margin for the balance of the year versus the benefit we recorded in Q1. For the full year, we now expect gross margin expansion of about 125 basis points.\r\nAs both Mark and Trevor discussed earlier, our growth strategies are working and we'll continue to invest in them. We expect demand creation to grow at a low double-digit rate for Q2 and at a high single-digit rate for the full year. Operating overhead is expected to grow at a high-teens rate for Q2 and at a mid- to high-teens rate for the full year, reflecting higher variable DTC expenses as well as investments in digital innovation and key operating capabilities.\r\nFor full year FY '15, we now expect the effective tax rate will be approximately 24.5%.\r\nOverall, assuming no material changes in FX rates, we expect earnings per share to grow at a high-teens rate for Q2 and about 20% for the full year, reflecting strong top line momentum and continued gross margin expansion, partially offset by strategic investments in our biggest growth drivers.\r\nQ1 was a great start to the fiscal year, and we remain confident in our ability to drive strong growth and deliver shareholder value.\r\nWe're now ready to take your questions.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nThank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's Fiscal 2015 First Quarter Results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website, investors.nikeinc.com.\r\nJoining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker; followed by Trevor Edwards, President of the NIKE Brand; and finally, you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions]\r\nI will now turn the call over to Nike Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nThank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone. Our Q1 results demonstrate that NIKE is, without a doubt, a growth company. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 15% to $8 billion, gross margin expanded 170 basis points and diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $1.09.\r\nOn previous calls, I've highlighted 3 of NIKE's distinct competitive advantages: our relationship with athletes and consumers; our ability to innovate; and the power of our portfolio. Those advantages are the foundation for the Q1 results we just reported and the competitive separation we're driving in the marketplace.\r\nFirst, our relationship with athletes and consumers are unparalleled. By relentlessly focusing on what they want and need, we propel our business forward. We use the insights we gained to deliver the products, services and experience athletes and consumers want. The lens we use to focus these relationships is our category offense, and the power of that approach is most clearly seen during global sports moments like the World Cup. These events provide us with the opportunity to showcase our most innovative products as the world's greatest athletes inspire us with their performance and their passion. They also create tremendous energy throughout the year, as we leverage these innovations and athletes' stories to deliver compelling products and experiences to consumers through their favorite sport.\r\nAs I think about the evolving consumer landscape, there are a number of trends that play to NIKE's strengths. The middle class is growing around the world, interest in sport continues to grow, and consumers are investing more and more in their own health and fitness. Apparel and footwear styles are becoming increasingly athletic. Because we know the consumer better than anyone else, we're able to leverage these developments to accelerate our growth. The result, we turn trends into real business momentum.\r\nSecond, let's talk about innovation. At the heart of our ability to achieve long-term growth is our unrivaled ability to innovate. NIKE delivers impressive innovations because we develop ever-sharper insights from athletes and consumers and we harness the power of new technologies, designs and materials. Our capabilities today are greater than they've ever been. Our challenge is to edit and focus those capabilities on the most significant opportunities. And when we do this effectively, we accelerate the pace of innovation, we create competitive separation and we deliver results like we did in Q1.\r\nIn just the past 90 days, we've demonstrated the versatility and potential of our advanced Flyknit technologies, with products in running, global football, basketball and most recently, football in the U.S. The consumer benefits are incredible, and looking ahead, I know the potential for this is significantly increasing the scope and scale this technology is very, very real. We set new levels of performance in apparel with products such as the NIKE Dri-FIT rain jacket, the NIKE Pro collection and the further extension of our Dri-FIT Knit, and collections like Nike Tech Fleece continue to drive growth and distinction by leveraging technical performance features into premium sportswear apparel.\r\nWe launched the Air Jordan XX9, our lightest Jordan ever, bringing a new level of basketball performance to the Jordan brand. And just last week, we expanded the potential of our Zoom Air technology with the launch of the LeBron 12. We have some very ambitious plans for this signature Air technology. I can't tell you much more now but I will say that the LeBron 12 is just the beginning of the revolution.\r\nIt's important to understand that NIKE's innovation agenda goes beyond product. It touches everything we do. One example is how we're leveraging the power of digital. The digital world moves fast, and NIKE is at the forefront. We're employing new ways to engage consumers online as we create communities, services and e-commerce experiences that fuel our growth strategies around the world. These strategies are strengthening our relationships with consumers and driving our business, as e-commerce revenues were up over 70% in the first quarter.\r\nGoing forward, we will innovate at an increasingly rapid pace. We are a growth company because we are an innovation company. That is why we are committed to sustained investment in this area. We know it fuels top and bottom line expansion and drives value for our shareholders. And when I look at our innovation pipeline, I see innovations that will, no doubt, surprise and delight. Innovations that are better for athletes, consumers and the planet. I couldn't be more excited about what's coming.\r\nThe final competitive advantage I want to highlight is the power of NIKE's portfolio. It's a complete offense that encompasses brands, geographies, categories, product types and channels. When all of these components are working together, the portfolio generates amazing growth. And when we double and triple click into the various dimensions of our business, we see even more potential.\r\nThe diversity within our portfolio is a tremendous competitive advantage. It allows us to thrive in a rapidly changing environment, create separation and ultimately, expand the market. Trevor will discuss the NIKE Brand's outstanding Q1 results in more detail, but let me give you 3 highlights from my point of view.\r\nOne, the NIKE Brand is strongly resonating with consumers around the world. We're delivering robust growth and profitability at some of our largest geographies, maintaining momentum in North America, accelerating growth in Western Europe and turning the corner with strong results in China.\r\nTwo, our category offense is accelerating growth. Our largest performance businesses, Running, Basketball and Global Football, continue to expand. Sportswear grew at a strong double-digit rate, and our Women's and Young Athletes businesses grew rapidly, in fact, faster than our Men's business.\r\nAnd three, we're driving growth across an integrated marketplace. DTC revenues grew over 30% in the quarter, and our wholesale business grew double digits, reflecting strong growth in stores and online.\r\nI've said that becoming a better retailer would make us a better wholesale partner. And our Q1 results are only the beginning. We have been extremely thoughtful about the investments we've made against our biggest growth opportunities across the portfolio. From accelerated product innovation to enhanced consumer experiences to sharply focused retail executions. It's the integration of complementary strategies and investments that leads to an acceleration of growth. And we will continue to make strategic investments to drive growth for years to come.\r\nI'm tremendously proud of our Q1 results, the momentum and our management team's ability to seize opportunities and manage risk. At the same time, I've never been more excited about the potential to raise the bar even higher in the future. Thank you. And now, here's Trevor.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nThanks, Mark. I'm also very proud of the results we reported for Q1. On a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 15%, with growth across all 6 geographies and nearly every key category. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 30%, driven by comp store growth of 15%, new store expansion and accelerated growth in online sales, up 70%. And global futures are a robust 14%. The great results we're reporting today clearly demonstrate the success of our vital growth strategy, the category offense. The power of the category offense is unleashed when NIKE works with our wholesale partners to develop an integrated marketplace. This happens when we have the right product at the right time, presented in a way that clearly differentiates the NIKE Brand to consumers.\r\nA key component of this offense is our own DTC business, which is an important complement to the wholesale business around the globe. As I said, we delivered impressive growth in the quarter, with expansion in all 3 DTC concepts: in line, factory stores and NIKE.com.\r\nOur investments in DTC as a strategic driver are clearly paying off, and we continue to see even greater potential ahead, and we're investing to create compelling presentations with our wholesale partners around the world as we expand the potential of the NIKE Brand in a holistic and integrated marketplace.\r\nAt NIKE, we earn our place with consumers every day. The World Cup is a great example of how we harness the power of sport to deepen the relationship between consumers and the NIKE Brand. We introduced more revolutionary product innovations in this World Cup than in any prior, and we're proud of the fact that more players wore Nike boots on the pitch than all other brands combined. Nearly 1/3 of those players were Flyknit boots. That's amazing.\r\nWe delivered products to consumers in compelling retail experiences all over the world, from our first football-only store in Copacabana, Brazil, to NIKETOWNs in London and New York to football-focused executions with our wholesale partners around the world.\r\nWith great football products, compelling retail presentation and strong consumer engagement, we drove great results. All told, Global Football revenue grew at a strong double-digit rate in Q1. And as of the end of the quarter, we have the leading footwear market share in the 9 largest football markets around the world.\r\nNext, I'd like to highlight Running. Our relentless drive to serve our athletes gives us an unmatched ability to meet their needs as they compete, train and express themselves. Our Q1 results demonstrate this with double-digit revenue growth, driven by premium footwear and apparel.\r\nIn footwear, the Pegasus 31, the LunarGlide 6 and the Free Flyknit have also sold through exceptionally well. In apparel, our Dri-FIT Knit, with its seamless construction and comfortable fit, has continued to resonate with consumers. And in sportswear, we continue to showcase our deep heritage with products like the Air Max Lunar1, the Nike Tech Windrunner jacket, which delivered strong results.\r\nLike the athletes we serve, we look for ways to continually improve. We see tremendous growth opportunities for Running around the globe, and we look forward to another season of great events starting this fall with the Nike Women's Half \t\t\tMarathon in San Francisco, followed by marathons from Chicago to Amsterdam to Shanghai.\r\nNow I'd like to talk about our Women's business, which continued to grow faster than Men's. Q1 revenue for Women's grew at a strong double-digit pace as we focus on realizing the significant potential in this large and growing business. It all starts by engaging and inspiring consumers, and here are some key examples.\r\nThe Nike+ Training Club has been downloaded nearly 17 million times and has become a personal trainer for women around the world. And we're also inspiring women with live experiences every day. 70,000 members participate in Nike Run Clubs across the globe and more are joining daily.\r\nWe also lead the women's market by continuing to deliver innovative products such as the performance footwear for the gym like the Nike Free Trainer 4.0; premium apparel such as the Nike's sculp tights and the Nike Pro Bra Collection, which saw exceptional sell-through; and iconic franchises that remain incredibly popular like our Air Max footwear and Sportswear Tech Pack apparel.\r\nLastly, we serve these consumers in increasingly dynamic retail environments. We're experiencing tremendous growth online, led by NIKE.com, and in-store, driven by sharper assortments and the continued expansion of the Nike Training Club concept to in-line stores. And our printed and digital style guides are a key accelerator leading to increased conversion. All told, it is this complete offense that's driving impressive results for our Women's business.\r\nLet me now turn to a few of our key geographies. First, Western Europe, where our incredible business momentum continued into the first quarter, with revenues up 25%. Our revenue growth was broad-based, with every key category and territory reporting double-digit growth. There is tremendous energy around the brand in Europe, with innovative products that are resonating with consumers. We saw strong results from both performance footwear and apparel as well as in sportswear.\r\nA critical component to unlocking this growth is the work we've done in the marketplace. By creating category-specific retail destinations with partners like JD Sports, Foot Locker and Intersport, we have differentiated the NIKE Brand with consumers. We also leveraged our own DTC business, including NIKE.com, as a key component of a segmented marketplace.\r\nWe continue to evolve our DTC strategy, and the market share gains in nearly every territory send a strong signal that our efforts are working.\r\nNext, the emerging markets, where revenues increased 10% in the quarter, with most territories growing in Q1.\r\nIn Brazil, the World Cup was a tremendous success for the NIKE Brand. Our ability to connect with consumers was unmatched, and our enthusiasm for the long-term potential of this critical market remains unchanged. That said, the recent weakening of the Brazilian economy requires us to carefully manage the marketplace to keep it healthy and productive for NIKE and our retail partners. While we are not immune to macro conditions, we are focused on maintaining strong brand momentum and deepening consumer connections as we work to elevate the marketplace for continued growth.\r\nIn Mexico, as discussed in previous quarters, distribution challenges led to an inconsistent flow of product into the marketplace. While the NIKE Brand continues to resonate with consumers, inventory levels at retail are higher than we would like given the slower sell-through in certain channels. In response, we are carefully managing the flow of product into the marketplace. At the same time, we are working with our wholesale partners to clear excess inventory already in the market. This is to ensure a healthy pull market in Mexico for the long term.\r\nBy staying closely attuned to consumer and marketplace dynamics, we seize opportunities and address challenges as they arise. Overall, we continue to see tremendous potential for long-term profitable growth in the emerging markets.\r\nIn Greater China, we continue to see strength in the NIKE Brand and positive near-term results from our actions to sharpen our product assortments and reset the marketplace. Revenues grew 20% in the quarter, led by 30% comp store growth in our own DTC doors. At the same time, partner doors that have been reset continued to outpace the rest of the fleet, delivering greater productivity and profitability.\r\nAs we continue to deliver innovative products and compelling experiences to consumers and reset additional retail locations, we are confident we can deliver double-digit long-term growth in this key market.\r\nAnd finally, North America continues to be a growth driver for the company, with Q1 revenues up 12%. North America is a clear example of the incredible results we can drive with the category offense across an integrated marketplace. We saw growth in nearly every dimension of our business, wholesale and DTC, in-line, factory and online, in nearly all key categories and across our Men's, Women's and Young Athletes businesses. The category offense is unlocking new areas of growth in North America by serving unique consumer segments. The more we focus and separate ourselves, the more potential we discover in our largest geography.\r\nUltimately, the strategies we have deployed around the world are working, as the investments we have made are yielding tremendous results. I am proud of the accomplishments, and I'm excited about the opportunities as the momentum of our business continues to accelerate. To put it simply, Q1 was a great quarter and we're just getting started. \r\nThanks. Now here's Don.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nThanks, Trevor. The outstanding results we delivered in Q1 continue to demonstrate the strength of the NIKE portfolio, exceeding the expectations we set only 90 days ago. As Mark discussed, these results are the product of aligned strategies and disciplined investment, creating a virtuous cycle, focused investments that deliver strong returns, fueling near-term growth and additional investments.\r\nAs our Q1 results demonstrate, our strategies are delivering great returns, and we'll continue to make targeted investments to drive long-term profitable growth.\r\nThe growth in Q1 was powered by our largest businesses. When our largest businesses have momentum, we're able to deliver the level of growth and profit leverage we are reporting today. We saw double-digit revenue expansion in each of our largest geographies, notably North America, Western Europe and China, driven by deeper and more tailored execution of our category offense in each market. Growth in these geographies accelerated in the quarter, and profitability grew faster than revenues.\r\nOur Q1 growth was broad-based across categories, with particular strengths in our largest performance category such as Basketball, Running and Global Football, as well as in Sportswear.\r\nWhile every product type reported higher revenues for the quarter, we posted 18% growth in Footwear, our largest and most profitable business. And while we delivered double-digit growth in wholesale revenues, DTC grew even faster.\r\nWith that introduction, I'll now recap our Q1 results.\r\nNIKE, Inc. first quarter revenue grew 15% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis. NIKE Brand revenue increased 15%, and Converse revenue increased 16%. NIKE Brand futures orders grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by a 9% increase in units and a 5% increase in average selling price. The increase was led by double-digit growth in North America and both European geographies, including strong growth in Sportswear, Basketball, Running and Women's Training.\r\nOn a reported basis, futures grew 11%, reflecting weaker international currencies, particularly in Japan, Argentina, Russia and Turkey.\r\nFirst quarter diluted EPS increased 27% to $1.09, driven by strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by increased SG&A investments. EPS also benefited from a lower tax rate and reduced share count, which together accounted for about 9 points of EPS growth.\r\nGross margin increased 170 basis points in the quarter, driven by higher average selling prices, a mix shift to higher-margin products, the continued strength of our DTC business and a modest FX tailwind. Gross margin also benefited from a mix shift to higher-margin geographies. These upsides more than offset downward pressure from product input cost inflation.\r\nGross margin for the quarter was better than expected, primarily due to a more significant mix shift to higher-margin products and geographies as well as stronger revenue growth in our DTC business.\r\nDriven primarily by World Cup marketing, Q1 demand creation increased 23%, lower growth than we projected 90 days ago. As Trevor noted earlier, our World Cup marketing in Q1 was highly effective driving energy around the world and across categories. As a result, we decided to shift some demand-creation investment to the balance of the year to support upcoming brand and product initiatives.\r\nOperating overhead grew 19% in Q1, reflecting investments in DTC, digital innovations and infrastructure.\r\nOther expense, net, was $3 million for the quarter, down significantly from Q1 of FY '14 when exchange rate movements in developing markets led to significant currency conversion losses. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 21.7%, better than expected due to the resolution of tax audits in several jurisdictions and an increase in earnings from operations outside the U.S., which are generally subject to a lower tax rate.\r\nOur return on invested capital continues to be strong as ROIC reached 26.2%, 70 basis points above last year. Inventories at August 31 were up 14% year-on-year and remain healthy overall, with the majority of the growth driven by North America and Europe as well as the expansion of our DTC business around the world. Our primary areas of focus for inventory management are Brazil and Mexico, where we continue to balance supply and demand to position those markets for ongoing growth.\r\nNow let's take a look at our performance by segment. In North America, Q1 revenue increased 12% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Basketball, Women's Training and Global Football. For the quarter, footwear revenue increased 15% while apparel grew 10%. Direct to Consumer revenues increased 22% in Q1, driven by 11% comp store sales growth and significantly higher NIKE.com revenues. On a reported basis, Q1 EBIT for North America grew 19% due to strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion.\r\nFor Q1, Western Europe revenue grew 25% on a currency-neutral basis, with double-digit growth across all territories and categories. As both Mark and Trevor discussed, we're very pleased with the results of our work to develop an integrated marketplace with engaging, differentiated retail presentations. Both DTC and wholesale revenues advanced strongly for the quarter.\r\nOn a reported basis for Q1, Western Europe revenue increased 32% while EBIT jumped 52%, driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion as well as the translation benefit of a stronger euro.\r\nIn Central and Eastern Europe, currency-neutral revenues rose 9% with growth across all key categories except Action Sports and all territories except Russia and Israel. We continue to closely monitor the situation in these markets and remain focused on the things we control, building strong consumer connections, leading with innovative products and managing a healthy marketplace.\r\nOverall, we're pleased with our results in CEE and remain confident in these geographies' growth prospects.\r\nOn a reported basis, revenue for CEE grew 7% but EBIT declined 16%, reflecting FX headwinds, particularly in Russia, lower gross margins and SG&A investments to support the World Cup.\r\nIn Greater China, currency-neutral revenue grew 20% for the quarter, with double-digit growth in our 3 largest categories: Sportswear, Basketball and Running. As Trevor discussed, we're seeing the results of our strategies to sharpen our product assortments and reset the marketplace.\r\nOn a reported basis for Q1, China revenue rose 18%, while EBIT grew 28% as higher revenues and gross margin expansion more than offset the impact of SG&A investments in DTC and our new Shanghai campus.\r\nOn our last earnings call, we projected revenues in China to grow at a somewhat faster rate in Q1 than for the full year due to changes in seasonal product flow and significant variations in prior year comparisons. Q1 growth was even stronger than we expected due to higher DTC revenue growth and at-once sales. We expect these trends to continue driving FY '15 revenue growth for China to a low to mid-teens rate, with the growth heavily weighted to the first half.\r\nIn the emerging markets, currency-neutral revenues increased 10%, reflecting revenue growth in every territory except Mexico and our Latin American distributors. From a category perspective, the growth was led by double-digit growth in Sportswear, Running, Global Football, Basketball and Women's Training. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue for the emerging markets grew 4% but EBIT declined 26% as a result of marketing investments in the World Cup and FX headwinds in a number of markets.\r\nWe remain confident in the significant growth potential of this geography. And as Trevor discussed, we're focused on doing the right things now to evolve these developing marketplaces and further strengthen our brand to generate sustainable, profitable growth for years to come.\r\nFirst quarter revenue for Converse increased 16% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, driven by market conversions in Europe and Asia as well as continued growth in direct distribution markets such as the U.S. and the U.K.\r\nEBIT increased 10% for the quarter as revenue growth was partially offset by investments in DTC and infrastructure to support the brand's long-term growth and profitability.\r\nWe entered FY '15 with tremendous brand and business momentum that drove outstanding Q1 financial results. Our updated FY '15 guidance reflects continued momentum over the remainder of the year, fueling strong growth in revenue and EPS as well as enabling continued investments for sustainable, profitable growth.\r\nFor revenue, we now expect constant dollar growth for Q2 and full year in the low double digits. This accelerated growth reflects robust consumer demand in our largest markets and categories, with particular strength in our DTC business. Our current outlook for reported revenue growth is 1 to 2 points lower, reflecting the stronger dollar. We now expect gross margin for Q2 to expand by 125 to 150 basis points. This is above our prior expectations as our strategies to increase average selling prices continue and growth in our higher-margin businesses, including DTC, continue to accelerate.\r\nThese benefits will help to offset increases in product input costs, particularly labor, and our actions to clear excess inventory in the emerging markets geography.\r\nIn addition, given current exchange rates, we expect FX will have a neutral impact on gross margin for the balance of the year versus the benefit we recorded in Q1. For the full year, we now expect gross margin expansion of about 125 basis points.\r\nAs both Mark and Trevor discussed earlier, our growth strategies are working and we'll continue to invest in them. We expect demand creation to grow at a low double-digit rate for Q2 and at a high single-digit rate for the full year. Operating overhead is expected to grow at a high-teens rate for Q2 and at a mid- to high-teens rate for the full year, reflecting higher variable DTC expenses as well as investments in digital innovation and key operating capabilities.\r\nFor full year FY '15, we now expect the effective tax rate will be approximately 24.5%.\r\nOverall, assuming no material changes in FX rates, we expect earnings per share to grow at a high-teens rate for Q2 and about 20% for the full year, reflecting strong top line momentum and continued gross margin expansion, partially offset by strategic investments in our biggest growth drivers.\r\nQ1 was a great start to the fiscal year, and we remain confident in our ability to drive strong growth and deliver shareholder value.\r\nWe're now ready to take your questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "My first question is on China. Don, you had mentioned that you expect the growth to be stronger in the first half than the second half. What happens in the second half that gives you a little less confidence that you can achieve that same level of growth that you expect from the first half?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's really not related to this year's momentum. It's really the comparisons to the prior year. We do believe that we've really seen fantastic improvement in that marketplace. And so this is not a belief that there's any lack of momentum in the back half. It's really the comparisons to the prior year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then my second question has to do with the category offense in Europe. It sounds like Women's is really starting to work very well. And I wondered if, in regards to just the overall category offense in Europe, will we see another wave or another level of category offense for Women in Europe now? Or is it all happening concurrently?\n\n---\n\nYes, just to hit on the category offense, of course, we're obviously very pleased with the results that we're seeing in Western Europe. And it really comes back to the decisions we made a couple of years ago when we decided to really reset the offense and really get focused on the category offense in Western Europe with a more centralized model, which allowed us to get closer to our accounts and work with them to really help expand the marketplace. So we're seeing tremendous benefit actually come from that. So strong resonance with consumers. Around the Women's business specifically, yes, we have now, as we said, focused on both our Running, our Women's Training as well as our Sportswear business. That offense is actually running in Europe. And again, we're also seeing a really increased drive around sneaker culture building around Women in Western Europe. So we feel very confident about the growth that we're seeing. And more importantly, we feel very positive about the long-term potential of the opportunity in Western Europe and actually around the world.\n\n---\n\nFirst question, the e-commerce number this quarter was just kind of through the roof, the acceleration from last quarter and from last year and off of a really kind of a very high growth rate already. Did something change? Did you open up new market, in terms of the digital e-commerce front, is there a new logistical capability there? What are the -- what's the underlying driver of that pretty significant acceleration? And then is that sustainable? Do you have the logistics and the inventory in place to kind of maintain that type of growth rate there?\n\n---\n\nLet me just jump in. It's Mark. The -- we're very bullish on our e-commerce opportunity. We've invested quite heavily in improving our capabilities, operational capabilities, our supply chain. We're seeing, again, the category offense really resonate through dot com. Obviously, it's a preferred channel where a lot of consumers are shifting and moving. Women's business is up significantly in that mix. Our customization, our NIKEiD, up significantly. Running, Sportswear, really across the main key categories, we're seeing tremendous resonance in that channel. This will continue to be a major growth opportunity for Nike and definitely a source of further investment. We think that the return on this investment will be as strong, frankly, as anywhere we have in the company. Very bullish, top, top priority for the company and continued opportunity for growth and profitability.\n\n---\n\nAnd one of the things I'll just add to that would be on -- usually, the category offense, we're able to basically segment and understand how to grow the Running business, the Women's business, each of the different dimensions of the business, so that our teams are squarely focused on doing that. So we think that's also really helping to accelerate the growth that we're seeing in the e-commerce business.\n\n---\n\nAnd then switch gears on my second question. Around the endorsement strategy, the sports marketing assets, you had some things happen over the last 90 days or so. You're able to keep Kevin Durant. It sounds like Manchester United contract moved somewhere else. How do you think about it philosophically, strategically? Or how should we think about it, where you want to make those investments, in which cases you might not want to make those investments? And is it -- or is it no rule of thumb, it's really just individual case by case, where you see the opportunities?\n\n---\n\nYes, well, first, I'll start by just saying that obviously, we believe very much in the power of sport and athletes to inspire people. So we're, obviously, very focused behind that. And obviously, some of the things that have been happening, there's been quite a mix in the marketplace. Obviously, some issues are serious and concerning to us. On the other side, you had some great opportunities with some great athletes like Kevin Durant, and our ability to re-sign those athletes. So from our perspective, we really line up how we connect and sign the right athletes really based on where we see the biggest growth opportunities. We line those 2 things out and we make sure that we find the athletes and the teams that can inspire consumers, at the same time, make sure that we can use that to then drive our business. And we remain singularly focused on that.\n\n---\n\nThe athletes aren't just a source of -- or a platform to promote the brand and to get brand exposure. They're the source of insights that we get. The relationships we have with the athletes are really what drives the innovation that ultimately drives our business and our growth potential. So that's been there since day 1. That will continue to be the case moving forward.\n\n---\n\nHey, 2 questions. The first, so the North American footwear growth, up strong, still up, I think, you guys said, I think, 15%. Any channels of distribution in North America that are outperforming that you could call out? And then the second question is the Sportswear double-digit growth, I think you mentioned it for North America, China and Europe. Can you remind us how long Sportswear has been growing at that rate? And sort of when the change was and what's driving that acceleration in that part of your business?\n\n---\n\nSure. Around North America first. I'd say that, obviously, we're seeing great momentum in North America. And we think it continues to demonstrate the power of the category offense, the ability for us to really connect with the consumer to make sure that we can drive the right products into the market, the most innovative products. And we're seeing incredible sell-through amongst all of our products and really, we're seeing it across channels, across all the different channels. It is pretty balanced in terms of the strength. So really, on every dimension, as we mentioned, we're just seeing great growth. One of things is we're very proud of the relationships that we have with our wholesale partners, our retail partners, because they really are working with us to better dimensionalize the market so we can continue to grow it. So we're seeing just great growth from that. Then specifically around Sportswear, if you recall, over a couple of years, we've certainly seen Sportswear business grow double digit, certainly on the premium part of the business. Where we saw the lagging part was certainly around the more entry-priced opportunity. We're seeing that business really strengthen, too. So that's really helping to buoyant the results that you're seeing around Sportswear. So again, it's when all the pieces start to work together, both footwear, apparel, as well as both the premium and also the entry business, and we're seeing that really play in all the markets that you mentioned.\n\n---\n\nThe first question that I have is I think DTC, up 30; e-commerce, up 70. Do you believe that you're seeing any signs of potential cannibalization with your wholesale/retail partners anywhere?\n\n---\n\nNo. No, I wouldn't say that. Like I'd mentioned before, the thing that we've been able to put in place is this idea of an integrated marketplace, and DTC plays a role of being a complementary part to the marketplace. So we're able to actually bring more dimension to the market by serving unique segments, not allowing the market to be more segmented and more differentiated. And we believe that's driving incredible amounts of growth. The other piece that we've talked about is the idea of us being a better retailer ourselves so we can be a better wholesale partner. And that is actually working, so we're able to transfer a lot of the learnings that we have done in our own stores, working with our retail partners around the world to accelerate their businesses, too.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then my second question is on -- around the NFL business, can you just comment on sort of the sales trends of the jerseys and the sportswear? And specifically, I can't seem to find a Richard Sherman jersey for my son. And I was just wondering if you could maybe talk to the process of selection on which athletes you're choosing for the jerseys these days.\n\n---\n\nI will try and find out exactly where your son is and make sure he gets that.\n\n---\n\nBob, I'll help you with that. Go ahead, Trevor, and answer the business question.\n\n---\n\nBut on the -- the NFL business continues to perform really well. And so we have a great relationship, a great partnership with the NFL, and we continue to see the jersey business grow. It didn't grow as fast as it did the prior year, and that's obviously because we had brought obviously newer uniforms in, but we certainly see good growth in our NFL business.\n\n---\n\nA couple of questions. The first, increases in ASPs in the futures have been really impressive. What are the ongoing opportunities in ASP? And what's your feeling on the sustainability of that trend? And then secondly, what are some of the opportunities in the supply chain for efficiencies to offset some of the inflationary inputs that you're seeing?\n\n---\n\nYes, certainly, on the pricing side, what I would say is that we have been really focused on ensuring that we give the consumer the best value, really start there. And we're making sure that, given the strength of our brand and the power of innovation that we bring into the products, that we have the ability to really command a premium price. And we're able to do that not only in individual markets because we work specifically in each market to make sure that we're paying attention to the market dynamics so that we can obviously give the consumer the most value.\n\n---\n\nAnd I think, Jim, on the -- your second question about the supply chain, we're working, really, across the whole supply chain and harvesting opportunities all the way from manufacturing, modernization and implementation of things like lean manufacturing or improved human resource practices in the factories, doing some factory automation, as I said, all the way to more revolutionary technologies like Flyknit. We're also continuing to work on streamlining the whole supply chain and making sure that we're matching up the supply and demand as tightly as possible, which reduces closeouts and maximizes margins. So there's a tremendous number of opportunities. We feel that we're going to be able to continue to take advantage of some of those things as we work to offset input cost inflation.\n\n---\n\nYes, let me add that the manufacturing revolution focus is a big one for us. It's not only a place where we can see some margin opportunity by scaling some of these innovations that are, really, in a sense, game-changing, and I'm talking beyond Flyknit. We're on the verge of moving some other what we call manrev or manufacturing revolution innovations to a much larger scale. So there's a great opportunity there. And those processes actually allow us to create products that are more innovative at the same time to actually improve performance while we actually get some margin opportunity at the same time.\n\n---\n\nGood to hear it. Don, some of the increase we're seeing on ASP, is that a function of the supply changes, better managing the flow of inventory and having less discounting?\n\n---\n\nWe have seen some benefit to that in most parts of the world, certainly. But I think, Trevor said earlier that the improvements in ASP are really 2 things, it's really the value equation and how we approach the consumer from a pricing standpoint. It's also the tremendous strength of the top end of the market, the premium end of the market, driven by innovation. So if you look at the mix of our product, it's really been extraordinarily strong at the premium end, and it's really, as Trevor said, the value of putting the brand, the product and then compelling retail distribution in place, which lets you shift the market to premium and maximize price.\n\n---\n\nYou've talked a bit about -- you told us a story about Western Europe a bit and made the analogy to the category offense strategy you put in, in the U.S. And I think you've injected a lot of those disciplines so far over there. But can we maybe talk a little bit about some of the similarities you're able to capture and maybe some of the differences that you -- as you are now, I would say, in the middle innings of rolling that out in Europe? And maybe as we think longer-term about Western Europe, it's growing very well but you've seen higher margins there in the past, that obviously looks like opportunities. Is there an opportunity there to push above prior peaks with the category offense like you did in the U.S.? Or do you think that, for now, that market still needs some investment to get to what you think the potential is?\n\n---\n\nYes, around Western Europe, I think -- and speaking about, obviously, the similarities, the first thing I'd say, for example, what we did see earlier, we saw certainly a very rapid growth of our Running business in North America. And we saw that we were able to really grow the Running market in a substantial way. We saw that Western Europe was trailing in that respect. We're now seeing that actually take place in Western Europe. So as an example, we're seeing a lot of the ideas, a lot of things that were done in North America really play the same way in Western Europe. Having said that, we do execute sometimes slightly differently in some of those marketplaces. So recognizing where the consumer is different or they might approach it from a different perspective, we do make sure that we have tailored product offerings that will meet that specific consumer in that marketplace. The other part is just a matter of we're still in early days. And so when you think about we've got Running rolled out, we've obviously got an incredible focus on footwear, we're amplifying our business in terms of how we think about our category business. And then when you drill it down and you go into our markets within Western Europe, you're going to see more growth opportunity. So we're seeing great growth come out of Germany. We're seeing great growth come out of the U.K. So it's really a matter of making sure that we think about that as a portfolio in and of itself. That's what we believe helps us to continue to see even further growth. But we really are -- we see tremendous potential in this marketplace, and we're only just scratching the surface.\n\n---\n\nWe have a lot of confidence around our ability to leverage and scale best practices around the world, but then also at the other end, to tailor our product and marketing as needed, even down to the city level. So it's that combination I think that is really a part of Nike's strength and our potential.\n\n---\n\nAnd if I could ask you one follow-up. We've been seeing nice -- you guys have really, obviously, been focused on pricing. And we see the numbers go by, we've seen your disclosure, how much that added to the gross margins quarter-to-quarter. Could you talk about the pricing strategy a little bit there? And what I find to be counterintuitive is how you guys are getting such a nice benefit from pricing while a lot of other categories in the U.S., in particular, are seeing pricing pressure. How do you think about policing that to make sure you're protected from overheating down the road as you think about your higher-level pricing strategy?\n\n---\n\nYes, well, a couple of things there. I think one of the things that we, I think, did a number of years ago is we've really embedded pricing into the way that we do the business every single day. So we're working on pricing at a style-by-style level, at a market-by-market level and making sure that, ultimately, we deliver the value to the consumer. At the same time, we do believe the power of our brand and our ability to bring more innovation to the market is really helping to drive a premium position. And we've seen it really in every market around the world, where the consumer is definitely trending towards premium products. Well-made with great innovation is certainly resonating with the consumers. And so -- but again, we do stay very mindful of the market situations in every market to make sure that we remain competitive and attack it at all different price points.\n\n---\n\nAnd I'd add one other thing, too. In our organization, the people who are really on the front-line from a pricing and a consumer value standpoint are the merchants. So this is a set of decisions that the people who are at the marketplace are really driving that strategy.\n\n---\n\nMark, if I could follow-up on the commentary on the manufacturing revolution, completely agree with you with that being potentially game-changing. And I think this is kind of the first time we'd heard the potential that, that could be sooner rather than kind of a long-term opportunity. Could you just speak to, again, specifically beyond Flyknit, is it 3D printing, is it other disruptive technologies that are in play? Again, the timing of when you might be able to scale that and what that level of penetration might look like?\n\n---\n\nYes, I'm not going to go into great detail here and now, but I will say that these breakthroughs really come in the shorter term, the midterm and the long term. We've got a steady flow of innovations beyond Flyknit to speed up our manufacturing, to make the whole process of manufacturing more efficient, more sustainable and offset some of those higher input costs. Specifically, 3D printing, that has tremendous opportunity for us. That's a bit on the longer road side of things, but we intend to be on the forefront of that potential. And there's other things that I don't want to get into at this point that will start to make a more meaningful impact over the next 1 to 3 years.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Fair enough. And then if I could switch gears. As we think about heading into the Brazil Olympics, clearly, a little bit of a macro downtick there as well as just some of the distribution issues across the Lat Am region, how do we think about sort of managing the emerging market business into that? Do you double down from an investment and sort of demand-creation standpoint? Do you manage back on that? Again, that's much bigger in terms of showcasing the NIKE Brand on a global level, but anything kind of reason-specific we should think about into that event?\n\n---\n\nYes, I'd say first that the brand is very strong in Brazil. It's very strong in Latin America. And in fact, the World Cup, obviously, was a great example of -- it was tremendous success for us. I think what we're doing -- what you're seeing around Latin America right now is certainly some macroeconomic headwinds that we're working through. What we're essentially trying to do is make sure that we're taking prudent steps to proactively manage the flow of product into the marketplace to make sure that the market can actually remain healthy for both us as well as for our retail partners. And that's really what we're doing. So it's more about making sure that we balance it. For the long term, we are tremendously enthusiastic about the opportunity that lies in the Brazilian market and in Latin America. Very high sports markets. Consumers have a very good passion for the brand and, certainly, passion for sports. So we really are very bullish about that market long term.\n\n---\n\nSo I wanted to ask about the North American Running business. I think you gave some color on some of the footwear and apparel SKUs products that did well. But I was wondering if you could dig a little bit deeper into the consumer and kind of what are they looking for in a product and if that's changing at all as we go into the holidays. And then also, I'm not sure if you gave a performance number for how North American Run did, but if you could do that, that would be great.\n\n---\n\nYes, around Running. Obviously, Running is our heritage and it's obviously our largest performance category. And we continue to see great growth in our Running business. In fact, the Running business grew double digits this year on top of double digits last year. So it certainly is still driving. What we're seeing in the category of Running, certainly around runners, we're obviously seeing the Women's business grow at a great clip. So we're seeing strong growth among -- around the Women's business but also amongst the premium business. So that consumer continues to want more dimension. And I would say also, we're seeing great things like focus on technology and certainly the focus on color and all of those things are starting to drive that marketplace. The other parts of the Running business is also the apparel. We're seeing a great growth around premium apparel in Running. Now the one area that, again, we continue to see opportunity is for us is strengthening our product line certainly around the more lower price points. And this is what Mark always speaks about, the complete offense. And this is the opportunity where we can really focus in more around our core business and really make sure that we strengthen that. But all in all, the Running business is still strong and we obviously can see the pipeline that's going to be coming so we feel very confident about the continuation of driving the Running business in North America.\n\n---\n\nYes, and unfortunately, we do not give category level information for our geographies.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us, and we will look forward to talking to you at the end of the next quarter.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Kate McShane (Analysts)】\nMy first question is on China. Don, you had mentioned that you expect the growth to be stronger in the first half than the second half. What happens in the second half that gives you a little less confidence that you can achieve that same level of growth that you expect from the first half?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nYes, it's really not related to this year's momentum. It's really the comparisons to the prior year. We do believe that we've really seen fantastic improvement in that marketplace. And so this is not a belief that there's any lack of momentum in the back half. It's really the comparisons to the prior year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kate McShane (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then my second question has to do with the category offense in Europe. It sounds like Women's is really starting to work very well. And I wondered if, in regards to just the overall category offense in Europe, will we see another wave or another level of category offense for Women in Europe now? Or is it all happening concurrently?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nYes, just to hit on the category offense, of course, we're obviously very pleased with the results that we're seeing in Western Europe. And it really comes back to the decisions we made a couple of years ago when we decided to really reset the offense and really get focused on the category offense in Western Europe with a more centralized model, which allowed us to get closer to our accounts and work with them to really help expand the marketplace. So we're seeing tremendous benefit actually come from that. So strong resonance with consumers. Around the Women's business specifically, yes, we have now, as we said, focused on both our Running, our Women's Training as well as our Sportswear business. That offense is actually running in Europe. And again, we're also seeing a really increased drive around sneaker culture building around Women in Western Europe. So we feel very confident about the growth that we're seeing. And more importantly, we feel very positive about the long-term potential of the opportunity in Western Europe and actually around the world.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Omar Saad (Analysts)】\nFirst question, the e-commerce number this quarter was just kind of through the roof, the acceleration from last quarter and from last year and off of a really kind of a very high growth rate already. Did something change? Did you open up new market, in terms of the digital e-commerce front, is there a new logistical capability there? What are the -- what's the underlying driver of that pretty significant acceleration? And then is that sustainable? Do you have the logistics and the inventory in place to kind of maintain that type of growth rate there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nLet me just jump in. It's Mark. The -- we're very bullish on our e-commerce opportunity. We've invested quite heavily in improving our capabilities, operational capabilities, our supply chain. We're seeing, again, the category offense really resonate through dot com. Obviously, it's a preferred channel where a lot of consumers are shifting and moving. Women's business is up significantly in that mix. Our customization, our NIKEiD, up significantly. Running, Sportswear, really across the main key categories, we're seeing tremendous resonance in that channel. This will continue to be a major growth opportunity for Nike and definitely a source of further investment. We think that the return on this investment will be as strong, frankly, as anywhere we have in the company. Very bullish, top, top priority for the company and continued opportunity for growth and profitability.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nAnd one of the things I'll just add to that would be on -- usually, the category offense, we're able to basically segment and understand how to grow the Running business, the Women's business, each of the different dimensions of the business, so that our teams are squarely focused on doing that. So we think that's also really helping to accelerate the growth that we're seeing in the e-commerce business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Omar Saad (Analysts)】\nAnd then switch gears on my second question. Around the endorsement strategy, the sports marketing assets, you had some things happen over the last 90 days or so. You're able to keep Kevin Durant. It sounds like Manchester United contract moved somewhere else. How do you think about it philosophically, strategically? Or how should we think about it, where you want to make those investments, in which cases you might not want to make those investments? And is it -- or is it no rule of thumb, it's really just individual case by case, where you see the opportunities?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nYes, well, first, I'll start by just saying that obviously, we believe very much in the power of sport and athletes to inspire people. So we're, obviously, very focused behind that. And obviously, some of the things that have been happening, there's been quite a mix in the marketplace. Obviously, some issues are serious and concerning to us. On the other side, you had some great opportunities with some great athletes like Kevin Durant, and our ability to re-sign those athletes. So from our perspective, we really line up how we connect and sign the right athletes really based on where we see the biggest growth opportunities. We line those 2 things out and we make sure that we find the athletes and the teams that can inspire consumers, at the same time, make sure that we can use that to then drive our business. And we remain singularly focused on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nThe athletes aren't just a source of -- or a platform to promote the brand and to get brand exposure. They're the source of insights that we get. The relationships we have with the athletes are really what drives the innovation that ultimately drives our business and our growth potential. So that's been there since day 1. That will continue to be the case moving forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nHey, 2 questions. The first, so the North American footwear growth, up strong, still up, I think, you guys said, I think, 15%. Any channels of distribution in North America that are outperforming that you could call out? And then the second question is the Sportswear double-digit growth, I think you mentioned it for North America, China and Europe. Can you remind us how long Sportswear has been growing at that rate? And sort of when the change was and what's driving that acceleration in that part of your business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nSure. Around North America first. I'd say that, obviously, we're seeing great momentum in North America. And we think it continues to demonstrate the power of the category offense, the ability for us to really connect with the consumer to make sure that we can drive the right products into the market, the most innovative products. And we're seeing incredible sell-through amongst all of our products and really, we're seeing it across channels, across all the different channels. It is pretty balanced in terms of the strength. So really, on every dimension, as we mentioned, we're just seeing great growth. One of things is we're very proud of the relationships that we have with our wholesale partners, our retail partners, because they really are working with us to better dimensionalize the market so we can continue to grow it. So we're seeing just great growth from that. Then specifically around Sportswear, if you recall, over a couple of years, we've certainly seen Sportswear business grow double digit, certainly on the premium part of the business. Where we saw the lagging part was certainly around the more entry-priced opportunity. We're seeing that business really strengthen, too. So that's really helping to buoyant the results that you're seeing around Sportswear. So again, it's when all the pieces start to work together, both footwear, apparel, as well as both the premium and also the entry business, and we're seeing that really play in all the markets that you mentioned.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Drbul (Analysts)】\nThe first question that I have is I think DTC, up 30; e-commerce, up 70. Do you believe that you're seeing any signs of potential cannibalization with your wholesale/retail partners anywhere?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nNo. No, I wouldn't say that.

And specifically, I can't seem to find a Richard Sherman jersey for my son. And I was just wondering if you could maybe talk to the process of selection on which athletes you're choosing for the jerseys these days.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nI will try and find out exactly where your son is and make sure he gets that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nBob, I'll help you with that. Go ahead, Trevor, and answer the business question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nBut on the -- the NFL business continues to perform really well. And so we have a great relationship, a great partnership with the NFL, and we continue to see the jersey business grow. It didn't grow as fast as it did the prior year, and that's obviously because we had brought obviously newer uniforms in, but we certainly see good growth in our NFL business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jim Duffy (Analysts)】\nA couple of questions.

Again, the timing of when you might be able to scale that and what that level of penetration might look like?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nYes, I'm not going to go into great detail here and now, but I will say that these breakthroughs really come in the shorter term, the midterm and the long term. We've got a steady flow of innovations beyond Flyknit to speed up our manufacturing, to make the whole process of manufacturing more efficient, more sustainable and offset some of those higher input costs. Specifically, 3D printing, that has tremendous opportunity for us. That's a bit on the longer road side of things, but we intend to be on the forefront of that potential. And there's other things that I don't want to get into at this point that will start to make a more meaningful impact over the next 1 to 3 years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Tracy (Analysts)】\nOkay. Fair enough. And then if I could switch gears. As we think about heading into the Brazil Olympics, clearly, a little bit of a macro downtick there as well as just some of the distribution issues across the Lat Am region, how do we think about sort of managing the emerging market business into that? Do you double down from an investment and sort of demand-creation standpoint? Do you manage back on that? Again, that's much bigger in terms of showcasing the NIKE Brand on a global level, but anything kind of reason-specific we should think about into that event?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nYes, I'd say first that the brand is very strong in Brazil. It's very strong in Latin America. And in fact, the World Cup, obviously, was a great example of -- it was tremendous success for us. I think what we're doing -- what you're seeing around Latin America right now is certainly some macroeconomic headwinds that we're working through. What we're essentially trying to do is make sure that we're taking prudent steps to proactively manage the flow of product into the marketplace to make sure that the market can actually remain healthy for both us as well as for our retail partners. And that's really what we're doing. So it's more about making sure that we balance it. For the long term, we are tremendously enthusiastic about the opportunity that lies in the Brazilian market and in Latin America. Very high sports markets. Consumers have a very good passion for the brand and, certainly, passion for sports. So we really are very bullish about that market long term.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Weiner (Analysts)】\nSo I wanted to ask about the North American Running business. I think you gave some color on some of the footwear and apparel SKUs products that did well. But I was wondering if you could dig a little bit deeper into the consumer and kind of what are they looking for in a product and if that's changing at all as we go into the holidays. And then also, I'm not sure if you gave a performance number for how North American Run did, but if you could do that, that would be great.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nYes, around Running. Obviously, Running is our heritage and it's obviously our largest performance category. And we continue to see great growth in our Running business. In fact, the Running business grew double digits this year on top of double digits last year. So it certainly is still driving. What we're seeing in the category of Running, certainly around runners, we're obviously seeing the Women's business grow at a great clip. So we're seeing strong growth among -- around the Women's business but also amongst the premium business. So that consumer continues to want more dimension. And I would say also, we're seeing great things like focus on technology and certainly the focus on color and all of those things are starting to drive that marketplace. The other parts of the Running business is also the apparel. We're seeing a great growth around premium apparel in Running. Now the one area that, again, we continue to see opportunity is for us is strengthening our product line certainly around the more lower price points. And this is what Mark always speaks about, the complete offense. And this is the opportunity where we can really focus in more around our core business and really make sure that we strengthen that. But all in all, the Running business is still strong and we obviously can see the pipeline that's going to be coming so we feel very confident about the continuation of driving the Running business in North America.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nYes, and unfortunately, we do not give category level information for our geographies.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nOkay. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us, and we will look forward to talking to you at the end of the next quarter.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Victoria. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.\r\nOn the call today are Executive Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; CEO, Safra Catz; and CEO, Mark Hurd. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking.\r\nThroughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-Q and 10-K and any applicable amendments, for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock.\r\nAnd finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision of these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.\r\nBefore taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I'll then review guidance for Q2, then turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comment. Those of you who have followed us for a while know that Q1 is a seasonally smaller quarter, which can mean more volatility in our results, and that's what we saw this quarter. Currency was a 1% tailwind to total revenues. Today, my comments generally reflect constant dollar growth rates.\r\nCloud revenue totaled $477 million, growing 29%. In that, cloud, SaaS and PaaS were $339 million, up 31% from last year and up 4% sequentially. Cloud Infrastructure as a Service was $138 million, up 25%. Q1 results in the cloud were better than expected and with us now 3x bigger than Workday. Now that's not enough for us, as our goal is to be bigger than Salesforce and faster growing than Workday while growing cash flow and improving our already high levels of profitability.\r\nNew software licensed was $1.4 billion, down 2% from last year, and software updates and product support was a record $4.7 billion, up 6%. Software and Cloud revenue totaled $6.6 billion in Q1, growing 6%.\r\nCustomers have started to move from on-premise systems to the cloud, but with so many on-premise customers and only 30% of our support based in applications, we haven't seen a reduction in software update and product support renewal rates, which continue at their usual high levels. However, as the movement to the cloud grows, we expect this transition will affect our revenue to the positive. These customers will essentially replace their software support payment with a cloud subscription, which will mean substantially more revenue to Oracle. That is because not only will we be providing the most up-to-date software but we'll also be providing the hardware, the application management and complete operation.\r\nOf course, we expect that as the customer pays more to Oracle, this increase will be more than offset by a reduction in their cost of implementing and running their own systems. And because we control nearly all of our own supply chain and benefit from enormous economies of scale, we expect most customers converting their premise-based software support payments to cloud subscription will be immediately accretive to operating income as well. \r\nIn the case of new or existing customers taking cloud subscriptions in lieu of buying new or additional software licenses, there will be a short-term delay in revenue. But over the medium and long term, we also expect more revenue and operating income as well as increased cash flow.\r\nAs for the details in this quarter, GAAP Software and Cloud results in the Americas grew 6%, helped by a very strong performance from our North America application team and our Global Business Unit. Thanks to the fantastic EMEA management team, considering the geopolitical situation in Europe and the Middle East, EMEA was up an outstanding 7%. Asia Pac grew 2%.\r\nEngineered Systems continued to grow and were over 1/3 of hardware product revenue over the last 12 months. However, hardware revenue in total was down 8% as other servers and storage revenues, especially tape declined. Hardware system product revenue was down 14% while hardware system support was down 2%.\r\nConsulting services, which I don't usually comment on because they are not as strategic to our business, also suffered from some execution issues in North America.\r\nTotal revenue for the quarter was $8.6 billion, up 2% from last year. The quarter was not dependent on any one large deal. Our non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, was 1% higher than last year, and operating margin was 44.4%, down just 22 basis points from last year because the sales shortfall in hardware -- in some hardware and consulting happened late in the quarter and did not allow us time to adjust our expense base in the quarter.\r\nFree cash flow increased to a record $14.7 billion over the last 4 quarters to an all-time high of $6.5 billion for the quarter, up 6% from Q1 last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21.5%. EPS for the quarter grew 4% in U.S. dollars to $0.62 on a non-GAAP basis.\r\nThe GAAP tax rate was 19.7% due to some one-time events and the mix of earnings. On a GAAP basis, EPS for the quarter was $0.48 in U.S. dollars, up 2%. At quarter end, deferred revenue was at a record $8.9 billion, up 5% from last year, and we had nearly $52 billion in cash and marketable securities.\r\nNet of debt, our cash position was $19 billion, so both of these balances are roughly $5 billion lower now that we've closed the MICROS transaction. This quarter, we repurchased nearly 49 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we repurchased more than 5% of the shares outstanding a year ago and paid out more than $2.1 billion in dividend, as nearly 75% of our cash flow was returned to shareholders.\r\nWe recently increased our share buyback authorization by an additional $13 billion, and we now have a total authorization of more than $15 billion available. The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share.\r\nAs I move to guidance, I need to make some comments first regarding MICROS, which we closed a few days ago. First, we will not own it for the whole quarter; secondly, and much more importantly, because our revenue recognition policies and our operating procedures are strict, the contributions from MICROS will not be consistent with their historical run rate.\r\nFor example, I am only expecting about $14 million in on-premise new license revenue for the quarter from MICROS. Also given recent currency movements, we expect to see a currency headwind of 1% for cloud revenues, 2% for Software and Cloud revenue combined and 2% for both hardware and total revenue, and that could very much change.\r\nSo taking all that into account, SaaS and PaaS, on a non-GAAP basis, is expected to grow between 40% to 45% in constant currency, 39% to 44% in U.S. dollars. On a GAAP basis, SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 39% to $0.44 -- 44% in constant currency and 38% to 43% in U.S. dollars. Cloud IaaS on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 40% to 44% in constant currency and 39% to 43% in U.S. dollars.\r\nSoftware and Cloud revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, including SaaS, Pass, IaaS, new software licensed and software support, is expected to grow 5% to 8% in constant currency, 3% to 6% in U.S. dollars. Hardware system revenues on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, which includes hardware system product and hardware system support, is expected to be negative 8% to positive 2% in constant currency, negative 10% to 0% in U.S. dollars.\r\nTotal revenue growth on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 2% to 6% in constant currency, 0% to 4% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.68 to $0.72 in constant currency, $0.66 and $0.70 in U.S. dollars. GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.53 and $0.57 in constant currency and $0.55 and -- $0.51 and $0.55 in U.S. dollars.\r\nThis guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 22.5% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 23%. Of course, it may end up being different. As you've seen in the last few minutes, we announced that Larry was elected Executive Chairman and appointed Chief Technical -- Technology Officer. Mark and I have been appointed CEO. Other than Mark and I reporting to the Board of Directors, of which Larry will be Executive Chairman instead of to Larry directly, no other reporting relationships will change at the company.\r\nIn addition, though I will no longer go by the CFO title, I will be the Principal Financial Officer for all regulatory purposes. We will not be hiring a CFO, and my teams will continue to report to me.\r\nWith that, I will turn it over to Larry for his comments.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Safra. Next week at Oracle OpenWorld, we will be rolling out our new Database Cloud service, with our new multi-tenant Database as a Service offering. Our customers and ISVs can move any of their existing applications and databases to the Oracle cloud with the push of a button.\r\nWith the push of a button, your data is automatically compressed 10:1 and encrypted for secure and efficient transfer to the cloud. With the push of a button, your existing application automatically becomes a multi-tenant application and is moved to the Oracle cloud. No reprogramming is required.\r\nEvery single Oracle feature, even our latest high-speed in-memory processing, is included in the Oracle Cloud Database Service. Hundreds of thousands of customers and ISVs have been waiting for exactly this. Database is our largest software business, and database will be our largest cloud service business. Mark, over to you.\n\n---\n\nYes, listen. Before we take questions, I'd thought I'd just give you 7 or 8 facts about our cloud business in the quarter. First, bookings grew 54%, 3x last year's growth rate. Fusion bookings, ERP, HCM and SFA all grew triple-digits. Two, revenue grew 32% USD, 2x last year's growth rate. Three, we got 500 new cloud customers in the quarter. Four, 170 of them were HCM customers. Based on what I heard Workday report, they got something like 25. We got 60 Fusion HCM new customers in the quarter.\r\nFour, in CX, we had 290 new customers, 90 including Fusion -- 90 Fusion SFA and almost 200 marketing new customers in the quarter. Five, ERP, we added 90 new customers in Fusion ERP and a like number in our EPM cloud. And all I'm talking about now here is ERP cloud and EPM cloud. \r\nFusion overall had triple-digit bookings growth, triple-digit revenue growth. We added nearly 200 net new Fusion customers and had many tens of go-lives. And while the transition to the cloud is in the early stages, we're already at a run rate of nearly $2 billion.\r\nA couple of comments on hardware. We declined in SPARC this quarter while we grew Engineered Systems double-digits. As Safra mentioned, Engineered Systems now makes up 1/3 of our hardware. While we're growing double-digits, our competitors are declining double-digits.\r\nWe shipped our 10,000th Engineered System in Q1. Lifetime bookings in hardware alone for Engineered Systems now exceed $3 billion. Hardware support margins are now approaching 70%, as a testimony to the change in our overall hardware mix and the stickiness of this business.\r\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to you all for questions.\n\n---\n\nVictoria, we'll go to the Q&A portion of the call, please.",

Lifetime bookings in hardware alone for Engineered Systems now exceed $3 billion. Hardware support margins are now approaching 70%, as a testimony to the change in our overall hardware mix and the stickiness of this business.\r\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to you all for questions.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Ken Bond (Executives)】\nVictoria, we'll go to the Q&A portion of the call, please.",
      "transcript_text3": "My question is for Larry. Larry, I wonder if you could address the issue of why the change in your role in the company and if you could clarify what the change might really be in terms of the working relationship and your responsibilities and daily activities in the business.\n\n---\n\nWell, again, Mark and Safra have done a spectacular job, and I think they deserve the recognition of their new titles. I'm going to continue to work with Thomas Kurian in software engineering and John Fowler in hardware engineering and Ed Screven and Mark and Safra as I have exactly in the past. So I'm going to continue doing what I've been doing over the last several years. They are going to continue what they've been doing over the last several years. So they deserve the recognition, they deserve the CEO title, and I'm happy that our management team continues forward as a team.\n\n---\n\nMark and Safra, congratulations to the new role. Question for me is, like, if you look about -- into the quarter, I mean, obviously, there were expectations out and you were -- come slightly weaker. On the one hand side, I see the transformation, I see a very strong deferred number, and a very strong cash number, but then I see the hardware basis [ph]. How do you think about the quarter and how -- in Q4, you thought it was better than we thought about it. How do you think about Q1 now?\n\n---\n\nWell again, I like Safra's quote. We're focused on 2 things, becoming #1 in the cloud. That means growing our cloud business rapidly. So you're seeing an acceleration in our growth rate. We're forecasting that we grow our cloud, our SaaS and PaaS cloud business this coming quarter between 40% and 45%. So not only are we getting bigger in the cloud. We're -- our growth rate is going up, and that's usually the opposite of what happens. So we're focused on becoming #1 in the cloud, being bigger than Salesforce in the cloud. And to do that, we've got to increase our growth rate, and that's exactly what we're doing. Now while we're doing that, we have one other key focus, to continue to deliver record levels of cash flow, and that's exactly what we're doing. So we're getting bigger in the cloud. Our growth rate is increasing in the cloud. Our cash flow is getting better. We think it was a great Q1, and it's going to get even better in terms of our growth rates in the cloud.\n\n---\n\nI thought you might mention in your question that the Chairman last quarter referenced a 50% bookings growth rate. And we delivered 54%, and I'll make a bold prediction we'll do it again.\n\n---\n\nAnd that's exactly what we need. Again, when we say we want to be #1 in the cloud, we have to deliver growth rates in that 50% range. And that's what we're shooting at, and that's what we think we can achieve. And by the way, that isn't even including our new database service that we roll out this fall. So that's going to add a multiplier to our growth rate in the cloud. So we're getting triple-digit growth rates, I mean, in our Fusion Applications, our internally developed, organically developed Fusion Applications, and now with the database in the cloud, we think that's going to continue to amplify that growth rate and increase the size of our business and make us #1. So if we can do that, we can become #1 in the cloud -- execute this transition, we'll become the leader in the cloud and deliver record level cash flow. We think we're doing a pretty good job.\n\n---\n\nCongrats, guys, on the growth that you're seeing in the cloud both in terms of just the revenue and, obviously, the upside in deferred. And along those lines, I wonder if you could comment or just provide some more details on what you're seeing in the cloud versus on-premise, on the application side. Mark, you noted some pretty nice wins in terms of Fusion HCM. I'm just wondering if you could provide some more detail and kind of compare and contrast the on-premise and the cloud.\n\n---\n\nYes, Phil, I mean, first, my prediction there of 50%, to Larry's point, was a SaaS prediction as opposed to an overall cloud prediction, which, frankly, could be higher. On apps in the quarter, we grew apps in the quarter on-premise. We had double-digit growth in North America on apps. So we had good growth on apps license plus what we did in SaaS. So it was a really strong overall apps ecosystem quarter.\n\n---\n\nLet me add that -- I believe this number is correct. We added more ERP customers in the cloud this past quarter than Workday has had in the life of their company.\n\n---\n\nCorrect.\n\n---\n\nSo how about that? So we are feeling really good about our ability to become the leader in ERP. We are the leader in mid-market and high-end ERP in the cloud, increase our leadership in marketing and to beat Workday in their core HCM business.\n\n---\n\nWell, I think that context is what you're looking for. We had a strong ERP license quarter in North America. We had a really strong SaaS ERP number in North America. And to Larry's point, if everything we've heard Workday talk about with their customers, we got more in the quarter than they have in the lifetime of their company.\n\n---\n\nI would like to get some color on the 12c database cycle, specifically the drivers and when we should expect it to impact numbers.\n\n---\n\nWell, again, there are 2 key portions of the 12c database: one is the fact that it takes your existing applications and makes them multi-tenant by virtue of running on the 12c version of the database. And the second is it takes your existing applications and stores the data in-memory, in compressed columnar format, therefore sometimes increasing your analytic performance by a factor of 100. So those are the 2 big drivers on our 12c database. But as you know, it takes people a while to adopt these features. But I think you're going to see the database business -- option business, accelerate through the remainder of this fiscal year, and it will continue on through the next fiscal year. So I think we're going to get strong results for the rest of this fiscal year, and again, it will continue on for at least another 12 months after that.\n\n---\n\nYes, database options actually was in double-digits, and exactly as Larry said, it is accelerating. It has accelerated. It has actually doubled, more than doubled, so doing very, very well. And in-memory is one of those options.\n\n---\n\nIs it where you would expect it to be at this point in the cycle?\n\n---\n\nYes, I'd say it's slightly ahead of where we would normally expect it to be. Now we were optimistic about these 2 features. So we thought the adoption rate would be faster than historically we've experienced with new versions of the database, and that's exactly what's happening. But again, it's a geometric progression. It's happening sooner, but the big numbers are still 1, 2 quarters away.\n\n---\n\nWell, first, congratulations on the changes in the roles, but I do have to say it's -- Larry, we're going to miss you on these calls, and it's been quite a run.\n\n---\n\nYou should be so lucky. I'm staying on the calls. So you're going to have to wait a little while longer before you get me off the calls. I apologize to everyone for that.\n\n---\n\nGood news then. Good, we can still bother you then with our questions. So -- well, with that, I really had 2 questions. One, maybe Mark you can tackle, and then one for Safra. But Mark, on the hardware side, can you give us a little more color on, let's say, some of the shortfall that you saw and maybe break it down by geo or break it down by product line and just some color there. And then Safra, just on your deferred revenue growth, again, maybe talk a little bit about the composition of the upside you saw in deferred revenue and whether that was maintenance, multi-year contracts on the SaaS bookings side, just in general, what was driving that for the business?\n\n---\n\nHere, let me take deferred revenue because I always get that question when it goes down, and so I'm going to take it when it goes up also. It's the same answer. I know that's really dull, but the reality is that deferred revenue is almost entirely, but not entirely, but almost entirely impacted by support, which, as I mentioned, remains extremely strong. Q1 is always an extremely -- it's seasonal. It's everything I've ever told you in every one of the calls. It's very, very strong. Yes, some of it is SaaS, but really the bulk of it and the growth is the business remains very, very strong. Renewals remain very, very strong. And as a result, deferred revenue remains strong and growing. So it's dominated, because of the sizes of the business, by the growth of increased support.\n\n---\n\nOn hardware -- by the way, to Safra's point, applications support revenue grows [ph], I just thought I'd add that in.\n\n---\n\nYes, of course.\n\n---\n\nJust so you make sure everybody's clear who has an opinion on that. In hardware, we had tape decline. We had SAN decline. We have a new SAN release that will come out shortly, OpenWorld. We grew in what we think of as ZFS, so our NAS storage grew. Engineered Systems, I mentioned, grew double-digits. Now while I say SPARC declined within Engineered Systems, the SPARC SuperCluster actually had very strong growth. So we had strong growth in Engineered -- or we had double-digit growth in Engineered Systems, strong growth within that with SPARC SuperCluster, ZFS, NAS storage growth, tape declined, SPARC declined. That's hardware.\n\n---\n\nI just want to drill into the tech side of the business. It looks like that what we've been waiting for, the 12c product cycle. Can you talk about if the weakness in tech licenses in the quarter was due to transition effect as you get into 12c training or if there was any execution pockets that you've run into. And also I think you were pretty optimistic and you continue to be optimistic about the demand for multi-tenant and in-memory. Can you compare that to how strong the [indiscernible] cycle was?\n\n---\n\nSo I'll take the first part, but I'd say on tech overall, I think tech overall was fine, with the exception of one region, which was North America. So if you looked at all the numbers Safra gave you, I think good clarity on the options business, which was strong, even in North America, but core tech North America was weak. Virtually around the rest of the world, it was fine. So we had good performance, roughly what we expected in the quarter in what I would call core tech.\n\n---\n\nAs far as the adoption rate, we're seeing in-memory and multi-tenant is actually being adopted at a faster rate than rack. And I think rack is a good comparison because rack is absolutely a strategic feature for transaction processing, where in-memory is the strategic feature for query processing. And I -- it's just that rack actually takes -- is a little more difficult to implement, so I'd say the adoption was therefore somewhat impacted from customers trying it out, getting used to it and getting people trained, and then they would -- it would pan out beyond a few critical -- mission-critical applications. In in-memory, it doesn't require a lot of training, it literally is kind of a push of a button, and it runs a lot faster. Therefore, we're seeing somewhat of a faster adoption rate, and I think you'll see that over the next several quarters. So it should be at least as big as rack and grow slightly -- and have a slightly faster adoption rate.\n\n---\n\nBy the way, Kash, I should have taken the time to have done a shout-out to our European team. Safra did that, but I'll do it as well. In core tech in Europe, we grew double-digits. So just to give you a context of the kind of performance we saw in Europe. It's truly, truly outstanding.\n\n---\n\nLet me add my voice to that. As our Russian business kind of headed towards 0 and they had all these other problems that you read about in the newspaper or on the web, and they still managed -- Loïc still managed to do a brilliant job over there, and his team continues to execute very, very well in what we would call difficult circumstances. So we're thrilled about the work he's doing for us.\n\n---\n\nMy question is back to the leadership changes. And in particular, I'd love to learn a little bit more about how these changes might trickle down into the rest of the Oracle organization. Safra, you touched a little bit on the CFO role and how -- I think you left a message that, really no significant change. I wanted to ask Mark, as you transition to your new role, whether that would result in any change on the sales leadership and sales structure side as well.\n\n---\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\nYes, and Karl, I just want to make sure we are very, very clear. There will actually be no changes, okay? Not no significant changes. I just want to clarify, no changes whatsoever.\n\n---\n\nAnd Karl, I don't want to be sharp, but it's just not in our -- in my view, we're pretty flat in terms of the way we run the place, and we want to keep it that way. So I want to stay closer to the action, not get farther away from the action. So to be direct, the answer is no, but I want to make sure you heard the rest of that.\n\n---\n\nMaybe for each of you, just to touch on the business model transition to subscription. How long do you expect this to take to roll through the model? Larry, I know even in the database side, there's some interesting opportunities as Database as a Service can impact the old-school model. And I'm just curious how you look at this. And then for all of us on the line, obviously, you get to see the backlog number and you can look at the growth, but we can actually see the physical backlog. And at some point, would you look to do something like Salesforce, where they give you a backlog number every quarter as a reporting metric going forward?\n\n---\n\nSo again, the way I look at it is we're going to be doing more for our customers, exactly what Safra said earlier. We're going to be doing more for our customers than we did before. So before, we used to sell them software and they would have to provide their own data centers and their own machines and their own labor and their own network to run all of that. And now we're going to put a lot of that in our data center. We're going to buy the machines. We're going to provide the skilled labor, whether you're buying infrastructure as a service, we'll be maintaining the operating system and the virtual machine for you, along with the hardware and storage -- processing and storage. If you buy platform, we'll also be maintaining the Oracle Database and Java, the world's most popular programming language and the world's most popular database. That's our platform. We're going to be doing more for you, and as we do more for you, you're going to pay us more, but the customer is going to spend less, so it's a win-win. We get economies of scale. We get specialization of labor. We're very good at running Oracle databases. We're very good at managing Java virtual machines. We're pretty good at running data centers, and we're great at running all of these applications. And that's the third level. If you buy our ERP and our planning applications, then -- again, we're doing -- we're your data center, we're your hardware company, we're your networking company, we're your storage company, we're all of those things. So the promise is for Oracle to be a much larger and much more profitable and much more critical supplier to our customers, a much more strategic supplier to our customers, especially when you go to the next level of application, which are the vertical applications, where we -- and financial services for banks, for telephone companies, for retailers, for hotels and restaurant chains, all of those things. It gives us an opportunity to give them a complete solution, which is strategic to their business and has much higher value than selling technology components, which is what the industry has been doing historically. So we see this is as a huge opportunity for Oracle Corporation to grow and expand our relevance into the next generation of computing, grow our business, be more profitable. And we think we have all of the assets to do that. I mean, it's very interesting that in ERP, we overnight, over 1 quarter, sold more ERP systems in the cloud than Workday has done in the life of their company. We have a lot of assets. One of the things we lead with, with ERP is budgeting and planning, EPM in the cloud. Workday's answer to that is we don't have one of those. None of our competitors have one of those in the cloud. SAP, as far as I know, isn't moving anything to the cloud other than Ariba and SuccessFactors. By the way, which I'm going to point out, run on Oracle. Both of them run on Oracle, not HANA, run on Oracle. So Oracle's already the most popular database in the cloud. So every generation of computing, computing gets bigger. And this is our chance to get bigger, to become more important. If we execute well and when Mark says he wants to stay close to the action and when Safra says we got a laser-like focus on 2 things, to be #1 in the cloud and delivering record levels of cash flow. We are all focused on this unbelievable opportunity to be the one big company, the one big company with all the resources to make this transition to the cloud and become the leader in that next-generation computing. It's an opportunity we're all focused on, and we're not going to miss it.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Larry. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call.

Therefore, we're seeing somewhat of a faster adoption rate, and I think you'll see that over the next several quarters. So it should be at least as big as rack and grow slightly -- and have a slightly faster adoption rate.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nBy the way, Kash, I should have taken the time to have done a shout-out to our European team. Safra did that, but I'll do it as well. In core tech in Europe, we grew double-digits. So just to give you a context of the kind of performance we saw in Europe. It's truly, truly outstanding.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nLet me add my voice to that.

And in particular, I'd love to learn a little bit more about how these changes might trickle down into the rest of the Oracle organization. Safra, you touched a little bit on the CFO role and how -- I think you left a message that, really no significant change. I wanted to ask Mark, as you transition to your new role, whether that would result in any change on the sales leadership and sales structure side as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nNo.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nYes, and Karl, I just want to make sure we are very, very clear. There will actually be no changes, okay? Not no significant changes. I just want to clarify, no changes whatsoever.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nAnd Karl, I don't want to be sharp, but it's just not in our -- in my view, we're pretty flat in terms of the way we run the place, and we want to keep it that way. So I want to stay closer to the action, not get farther away from the action. So to be direct, the answer is no, but I want to make sure you heard the rest of that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brent Thill (Analysts)】\nMaybe for each of you, just to touch on the business model transition to subscription. How long do you expect this to take to roll through the model? Larry, I know even in the database side, there's some interesting opportunities as Database as a Service can impact the old-school model. And I'm just curious how you look at this. And then for all of us on the line, obviously, you get to see the backlog number and you can look at the growth, but we can actually see the physical backlog. And at some point, would you look to do something like Salesforce, where they give you a backlog number every quarter as a reporting metric going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nSo again, the way I look at it is we're going to be doing more for our customers, exactly what Safra said earlier. We're going to be doing more for our customers than we did before. So before, we used to sell them software and they would have to provide their own data centers and their own machines and their own labor and their own network to run all of that. And now we're going to put a lot of that in our data center. We're going to buy the machines. We're going to provide the skilled labor, whether you're buying infrastructure as a service, we'll be maintaining the operating system and the virtual machine for you, along with the hardware and storage -- processing and storage. If you buy platform, we'll also be maintaining the Oracle Database and Java, the world's most popular programming language and the world's most popular database. That's our platform. We're going to be doing more for you, and as we do more for you, you're going to pay us more, but the customer is going to spend less, so it's a win-win. We get economies of scale. We get specialization of labor. We're very good at running Oracle databases. We're very good at managing Java virtual machines. We're pretty good at running data centers, and we're great at running all of these applications. And that's the third level. If you buy our ERP and our planning applications, then -- again, we're doing -- we're your data center, we're your hardware company, we're your networking company, we're your storage company, we're all of those things. So the promise is for Oracle to be a much larger and much more profitable and much more critical supplier to our customers, a much more strategic supplier to our customers, especially when you go to the next level of application, which are the vertical applications, where we -- and financial services for banks, for telephone companies, for retailers, for hotels and restaurant chains, all of those things. It gives us an opportunity to give them a complete solution, which is strategic to their business and has much higher value than selling technology components, which is what the industry has been doing historically. So we see this is as a huge opportunity for Oracle Corporation to grow and expand our relevance into the next generation of computing, grow our business, be more profitable. And we think we have all of the assets to do that. I mean, it's very interesting that in ERP, we overnight, over 1 quarter, sold more ERP systems in the cloud than Workday has done in the life of their company. We have a lot of assets. One of the things we lead with, with ERP is budgeting and planning, EPM in the cloud. Workday's answer to that is we don't have one of those. None of our competitors have one of those in the cloud. SAP, as far as I know, isn't moving anything to the cloud other than Ariba and SuccessFactors. By the way, which I'm going to point out, run on Oracle. Both of them run on Oracle, not HANA, run on Oracle. So Oracle's already the most popular database in the cloud. So every generation of computing, computing gets bigger. And this is our chance to get bigger, to become more important. If we execute well and when Mark says he wants to stay close to the action and when Safra says we got a laser-like focus on 2 things, to be #1 in the cloud and delivering record levels of cash flow. We are all focused on this unbelievable opportunity to be the one big company, the one big company with all the resources to make this transition to the cloud and become the leader in that next-generation computing. It's an opportunity we're all focused on, and we're not going to miss it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ken Bond (Executives)】\nThank you, Larry.

      "transcript_text1": "Good morning, and thank you. Thank you for joining us for a discussion of the Paychex's first quarter of fiscal 2015 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.\r\nThis morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2014. Our earnings release and Form 10-Q will be available on our Investor Relations page at paychex.com. This teleconference will also be broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 1 month.\r\nOn today's call, I will review the highlights for the first quarter of our sales, operations and product development areas, and Efrain will review our first quarter financial results and discuss our full year guidance. Then we'll open it up for your questions.\r\nWe're off to a good start in fiscal 2015. We're pleased with our progress toward our growth goals, and we began the year with momentum in both sales and new product enhancements. Client satisfaction and retention also remain at high levels.\r\nPayroll revenue is trending well with growth of about 4.5% due to increases in revenue per check, client base and checks per payroll. HRS revenue grew double digits for the first quarter as we continue to experience success in selling HR outsourcing solutions to our clients. Total service revenue grew 9%.\r\nThe positive momentum we saw in fiscal 2014 in sales execution has continued into 2015 as we experience solid performance in both new sales revenue and units. Our payroll and Paychex HR Services, in particular, continued to do well in Q1.\r\nWe also quickly brought onboard the increase in sales reps we planned so that we are fully staffed and have been successful in adding new bank and franchise referral arrangements, in addition to our strong CPA referral channel. Our partnership between our selling organizations has never been more efficient, as they have moved downmarket to be sure our clients are receiving the full value of the breadth of services that Paychex has to offer them. \r\nOur execution in service operations has continued its standard of excellence, demonstrated by strong client satisfaction results and client retention levels that remain consistent with recent highs. Our innovative leading-edge technology and products, coupled with our exceptional client service, we believe, is a differentiator in the market.\r\nFrom a technology perspective, continued investment in our SaaS solutions and mobility offerings position us for long-term growth. We have market-leading software-as-a-service solutions leveraging the latest technologies and continue to invest significantly in online capabilities and mobile applications.\r\nWe recently introduced mobile applications for both our Paychex Online Accounting Services and our expense management solution. In addition, our online payroll application was recently awarded a 5-star rating by a leading publication, the only major payroll provider to receive such a rating. \r\nWe completed the acquisition of nettime solutions, a leading cloud-based time and attendance solutions provider, adding yet another powerful offering to our software-as-a-service portfolio. This acquisition pairs Paychex's exceptional customer service and onboarding team with the SaaS time-and-attendance technology of a market leader.\r\nIn summary, we are off to a solid start for sales, service, product strength and financial performance for fiscal 2015, and I greatly appreciate the work of our Paychex employee team across the country.  \r\nI will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Marty, and good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call -- in today's conference call, we'll make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such, involve risks. Refer to the press release for a discussion of forward-looking statements and related risk factors.\r\nYou might remember that during the latter part of last year, we introduced a new health insurance offering within our PEO for PEO clients and worksite employees. Due to the self-insurance provisions within the new offering, we began classifying certain PEO direct costs as operating expenses rather than a reduction in service revenue. This change had no impact on operating income. This new product offering had an impact on our first quarter results since it was not initiated until the second half of fiscal 2014.\r\nAs Marty indicated, our first quarter financial results for fiscal 2015 represent a strong start to the year. Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter. I will provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of our outlook.\r\nTotal service revenue grew 9% for the first quarter to $657 million. Interest on funds held for clients increased 2% for the first quarter to $10 million. This was driven by a 3% increase in average investment balances. And as I've discussed with some of you, we're getting to the point where we've bottomed out in terms of decreases on our interest related to our client fund portfolio.\r\nExpenses increased 12% for the first quarter, but this was primarily in compensation-related costs and the PEO direct costs. The increase in the portion of PEO direct costs is the result of a new health care offering, as I mentioned previously.\r\nThe increase in compensation-related costs was driven by higher performance-based compensation costs, employee benefit-related costs and sales headcount. We talked a bit about our increase in sales headcount. We're up year-over-year in sales headcount. \r\nWe continued our investment in our product development and supporting technology, which has been growing at a faster rate than our total expenses. \r\nOperating income, net of certain items, increased 5% to $257 million for the quarter. We maintained strong operating margins and anticipate that our full year will be within our guidance range, which I'll discuss shortly.\r\nDiluted earnings per share increased 7% to $0.47 per share for the quarter, and net income increased 5% to $171 million. Diluted earnings per share were positively impacted by stock repurchases we made in the first quarter and in fiscal 2014.\r\nOn the payroll revenue side, service revenue exceeded 4% for the first quarter to $413 million. We benefited from increases in revenue per check, client base and checks per payroll. And I got a -- I saw a note that indicated what were checks per payroll. We didn't call it out specifically. It was about 1%. As we drift in that range or slightly below, we won't call it out specifically. So checks per payroll, up about 1%.\r\nRevenue per check grew as a result of price increases, net of discounting, along with the impact of increased product penetration. And as I mentioned, checks per payroll are growing but at a more moderate rate, as we expected.\r\nOn the HRS side, HR Services revenue increased 17% to $244 million for the first quarter. The increase reflects strong growth in both clients and worksite employees of Paychex HR Services and an increase in PEO revenue as a result of the new minimum premium health care offering started during the second half of last year. The increase from the new PEO health care offering represents approximately 2.5% of total service revenue for the first quarter. So just so you hear that again, increase from the new PEO health care offering represents approximately 2.5% of total service revenue for the first quarter.\r\nOnline HR administration products contributed to growth through sales success of our SaaS solutions. And retirement services revenue benefited from an increase in the number of plans and an increase in average asset value of participant funds.\r\nTurning to the investment portfolio. Our goal, as you know, is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We are conservative in the way we manage our portfolio. On the short-term side, primary investment vehicles are bank demand deposit accounts. And if you look at the balance sheet, you'll see that we had a fair amount of cash in the quarter. That's because of timing, and we didn't choose to invest all of that in VRDNs in Q1. \r\nIn our longer portfolio, we invest primarily in high-credit-quality municipal bonds. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.6% and an average duration of 3.3 years. I would just say that we are positioned where we want to be to take advantage of rising interest rates, should they come at some point, soon, hopefully.\r\nOur combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.1% for the first quarter compared to 1.0% for the same period last year. That's first time in a while we've said the compare is positive. \r\nAverage balances for interest on funds held for clients increased during the first quarter. This was driven by wage inflation, along with favorable trends in our client base and checks per payroll.\r\nI'll now walk you through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong, with cash and total corporate investments of $956 million and no debt. Funds held for clients were $4.1 billion compared to $4.2 billion as of May 31, 2014. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.6 billion for the quarter, the more relevant comparison. That's a year-over-year increase of 3%.\r\nTotal available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains on the portfolio of $41 million as of August 31, 2014, compared with a net unrealized gain of $35 million as of May 31, 2014.\r\nTotal stockholders' equity, $1.8 billion, reflecting $138 million in dividends paid during the first quarter and $38 million of shares repurchased. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 35%.\r\nCash flows from operations were $263 million for the first quarter, which moderated from the prior year. The change was the result of fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities, offset by higher net income and noncash adjustments to net income. The fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities between periods were primarily related to timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation, PEO payroll and income taxes. It really was primarily as a result of timing of a large income tax payment we made in the year prior period. It is common for us to have some significant fluctuations in working capital between quarters.\r\nWith respect to guidance, we reaffirmed our guidance for fiscal 2015. I'd like to remind you that our outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Total service revenue, as we've previously said, is expected to be in the range of 8% to 10%, with the ranges for payroll and HRS consistent with previous guidance. Net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 6% to 8%, and operating margin and tax rate for the year are expected to be consistent with prior guidance.\r\nAnd now I'll turn it back to Marty.\n\n---\n\nOkay. We will now open the call to any questions. Operator?",

We will now open the call to any questions. Operator?",
      "transcript_text3": "I wanted to kick it off on the payroll growth side, a 4.5% number, sort of at the high end of your 3% to 5% range. Just curious, is there any reason why you wouldn't be narrowing the range, say, to 4% to 5% from the 3% to 5%? The 3% seems conservative, even if we're only in the first quarter. Just wondering if you're seeing [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\nYes, George, thanks. So I guess it's a philosophy issue, so I should state what the philosophy is. What we try to do when we come into the year is say what do we think the ranges are for the year as a whole, so we don't have to revise every quarter guidance. We try to call out if, somehow, a quarter falls -- is a little bit unusual in terms of the guidance. So yes, I would say at the bottom end right now, 3% is pretty conservative. We absolutely start a little bit better than that number, but we still feel comfortable with the overall guidance range.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then I wanted to switch gears as it relates to your payroll card program or initiative, the partnership with Skylight that you have. Any color you can provide there as to demand for payroll cards? And I just wanted to get a sense, is a payroll card more profitable to Paychex than a standard check?\n\n---\n\nYes. I wouldn't say it's more profitable. It's not necessarily more profitable because we have a partner, obviously, involved in providing it. I'd say the demand for it, George, has been consistent but not huge. I think we were one of the first to have a payroll card over 10 years ago. And it just -- it has a small kind of grouping, those that are unbanked, for example, and so forth. And while we've seen that go up and down a little bit over time, more and more people want one card. If they're banked, they want one card. They don't want a separate payroll card. So I would say that the demand is consistent. We really like the product that we're involved with now and think that, that may pick up demand a little bit. But it's one of those things where we just like to offer a full wide range of offerings to the client as to however they want to receive their pay.\n\n---\n\nJust with regards to your investments in sales force, when do you expect to see the benefits come through? Is it more second half-weighted, or we should start seeing movements in first half as well?\n\n---\n\nYes. As I said, I think we got off to a good start. I think the new headcount that we've added in the last quarter, I think you'll see more of those benefits the second half of the year as they get -- we have a great training program, but obviously, they get trained, they start building their relationships with CPAs and other channels. And I think you'll see that more the second half of the year. But we're -- but we feel like we're off to a very good start. We continued in -- from Q4 and feel good about both sales units and revenue from the perspective, particularly of payroll.\n\n---\n\nAnd probably just a follow-on on that. What's the split between the sales force recruitment in payroll and HRS segments?\n\n---\n\nAs far as what the additions were?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nThe additions were a little stronger on the payroll side. We felt that, that was starting to pick up again in the second half of last year. And so most of -- much of the adds -- we don't break it out exactly, but much of the adds were on the payroll side and -- because we felt we're very well positioned down the HRS services side.\n\n---\n\nI just wanted to just get some more color on the PEO segment, how it's tracking. And maybe you can give us an update in terms of how pricing is developing on the PEO side.\n\n---\n\nI would say we felt really strong about the last half of the year from a competitive standpoint, where we feel very competitive. They've done very well with the carriers. The new plan, as Efrain mentioned, we think, has put us in an even better competitive position in the Florida area, and so we feel very good. We're off to a -- the big months are kind of coming in now this quarter. It's what's coming up for the benefit plans and so forth. But we feel very strong, fully staffed on the sales side, a lot of experience in that team. And of course, we offer both the PEO and the ASO version. So what's good about the way, I believe, we offer it is whatever the client needs to get the most value out of the service we have to offer them. But we feel very good about the PEO side and our opportunity here coming up, particularly this second quarter, as we see benefit plans get subscribed to.\n\n---\n\nYes. I'd just add that we're positioned, certainly, as -- in the market as well as we've ever been positioned. The addition of the minimum premium plan really helps in Florida, but we're seeing good demand across other markets. So the only caution or caveat I'd put on that is that third quarter is a big quarter for PEO, and that's where you see kind of how much you're winning the battle. So we feel good about where we started. Still, the year needs to play out a bit more.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And maybe just a follow-up on nettime solutions. Can you just give us some more color in terms of the level of traction that you're getting with that new offering and maybe compare that to your legacy T&A product? And are there any other product sets that you're looking to buy -- or to build or buy to improve your overall product portfolio at the moment?\n\n---\n\nYes. Right now, we're feeling very good about the portfolio of products. nettime was an opportunity that we felt we had a -- it was a real market leader there and that the team would fit very well and would fit into our SaaS products. We're seeing good traction, really, out of the gate as we integrate it into our payroll offering, which will come in stages. But then -- and then there's organic growth that we've continued at nettime itself. So we feel good about their organic growth, which they'll sell directly, and integrating it into our payroll platform. We've already had a number of sales. We're training everyone in our team on the product, and so you'll see a good combination of sales from the organic and the tie-in to Paychex. The integration takes a little bit of time, so -- but that will be coming up in the next quarter or so. So we're very pleased with the product. Whole management team is in place at nettime. Leadership is taking a very strong role, and it's just a great cultural fit with the company. So we feel very good about where this is. The legacy product has been very strong. We had a good, strong year last year. And we'll just kind of phase -- the legacy product has a little more, for us, integrated bells and whistles on it, which we're introducing, actually, even this quarter or next quarter. You'll see not only Web-punch online but complete mobility punch as well, time punches. And so we'll still be building on the legacy product for a little bit until we get nettime fully integrated in. But we're really pleased with the product and everything that it offers.\n\n---\n\nThey had a really nice track record of growing that business over 60% over the last 3 years, and it's a good example of the kind of acquisitions we like, smaller. We buy them to grow them, not for growth, and good product set, good management. And they're off to a good start.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Maybe just one last quick question is if you can give us an update on the retention ratio, retention rates that you're seeing in your business.\n\n---\n\nYes, very similar to last year. We're really ahead, from our perspective, on retention, so very strong. It probably -- still historic best for the company. From a payroll retention standpoint, we feel very good. So not only the sales have great momentum but the retention is right up there with our historic best, and we haven't seen any change in that. Obviously, big quarters coming up here with year-end, but so far, we're feeling very good about the retention.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to just ask a little bit about new business formation, get some general observations from you guys on whether you think we're stable or is there any improvement there. I know it's obviously an important source of new sales and growth for Paychex.\n\n---\n\nYes. So Jason, 2 answers to that. It'd be great if we had real-time data on what's going on in the economy. In the absence of that, we've noticed a trend ticking up on our sales to newly formed businesses. And it seems like over a number of quarters now, we seem to be picking up in that area. And if you go back a couple of years ago, we weren't seeing that trend. That now seems to be evident. It looks like you're getting better business formation. But of course, we're kind of an indirect -- or our observation on that is indirect. Our sales to new businesses are up.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Is there any way to get a feel, either qualitatively or quantitatively, whether or not that's reflective of any kind of share shift in terms of who's winning new businesses? Or is it -- is there not enough data to really call that out?\n\n---\n\nYes, there really isn't enough data to pull it out. It's very difficult to get that granular for new business sales. And I would tend to ascribe it a little bit more to some underlying growth in new businesses, and then I think we're getting better at execution, too.\n\n---\n\nYes. I think we have felt good about the win -- kind of the win-loss ratio against competitors, but we are definitely seeing an uptick in the sales from competitors and kind of an -- we look at it from a net gain from competitors. And we're definitely an uptick and a positive at this point as we started to see that the second half of last year, too. So Efrain's right. It's hard -- we're still not at the full new business creation that we were prerecession. It's certainly up, but it's not where it was based on everything we see. But as Efrain said, new sales -- sales to new businesses are up, and definitely, the gain from competitors is up, so we're feeling very good about that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just on pricing, are you still kind of trending closer to the lower end of your 2% to 4% range? And I wanted to just get a feel in terms of contract renewals in general. What percent of those are currently being done with a unit price increase versus how many are flat and how many have a unit price decrease? And has there been any change in those relative percentages over the past, I don't know, year or so?\n\n---\n\nYes. So Jason, so what we said is 2% to 4%. I would say we're floating off the bottom of that, a little bit closer to the middle of it. We do not give uniform price increases, so that's experienced a little bit differently by different customers. And we also don't have contracts. So one of the things that does differentiate us is that virtually across every single customer that we have, if we don't earn our keep from a service standpoint, you can get to walk without penalties. We do a little bit of that in the mid-market, but that's a relatively small part of our business.  So I would say the pricing environment's easing somewhat.\n\n---\n\nYes, and we feel good about -- now that we're through that first quarter, we have not seen a lot of fallout from the price increase. And so that's always a good determining factor in that first quarter. We would see it typically in the July, August time frame, and we haven't, so...\n\n---\n\nOkay. Just my last question. Any updates you wanted to provide on the Brazil JV or what's happening overseas in Germany and your payment processing offering as well?\n\n---\n\nYes. I'd say Brazil is off to a good start. There was a delay in the -- in some of the electronic filing requirements that we had expected the government had put in place. They delayed for a year. But we're off to a pretty good start. We're not -- we don't give exact client growth, but we feel very good about the start that we've had there since January. And in Germany, we're -- sales are above plan, so they're continuing to do well. And we're always looking for other ways to grow Germany even faster and the other -- Brazil as well.\n\n---\n\nEfrain, as you look at the results that you reported for the first quarter, would you say -- were they in line with your internal plans, or were you a little bit ahead of internal plans?\n\n---\n\nCrickets, right? We felt pretty good about the first quarter.\n\n---\n\nAll right. So Efrain, the balance sheet looks amazing still. You have a lot of cash on hand. Any thoughts as to what you would like to do with that cash? I know you have a share buyback in place, and I'm just -- beyond that.\n\n---\n\nYes, so we do have an opportunity to buy shares back. We have bought to date, including last year, about 7 million shares. We're significantly below where the -- we purchased those significantly below where the stock is trading. We thought -- obviously thought that, that made a lot of sense. Where we see opportunities to go in and buy, we will do that opportunistically. We think that makes sense. But the other thing is we have a good pipeline of acquisition opportunities. We want to keep our powder dry. We are -- as all of you know, we don't tend to do stupid acquisitions just to grow. And we like some properties out there. Now whether they're going to -- there's going to be something that we see over the course of the year, we'll evaluate that. And if we're getting to the end of the year and we have a significant cash buildup, then we'll have to have a discussion with the board about what next steps would be there.\n\n---\n\nAnd then, Marty, just on the Paychex Accounting Online business, how it's progressing, where you are, if you think you need to change the business model at all.\n\n---\n\nWell, I think the biggest thing we're learning is how to really acquire the clients and kind of get them -- and I guess to even step back further, get them to even -- to realize it's a great accounting product that we've invested in with Kashoo. And this has been out there for a while. It's a strong online accounting product, more of a bookkeeping type of software-as-a-service. But they still come to Paychex for payroll, benefits and outsourcing. And while the reputation is very strong there, they're not always -- it's a different marketing game to teach them about the accounting or bookkeeping online that we have available to them. So I think the biggest thing -- I wouldn't really change much. We may get a little more aggressive as far as getting to our own clients and getting them to understand that we have this nice offering that, I think, is going to be a real benefit and value to them. So probably more from a marketing standpoint, we're trying to see if we can get the knowledge that it's out there and that it's us and it has all the power and the strength of Paychex behind it. That's the biggest thing. Other than that, we're really pleased with the product. We're just -- I think we're just finding that the marketing is a little bit different in the approach and so forth. And we expect that to start to pick up.\n\n---\n\nThis is Jeff Rossetti in for Joe. I just wanted to see if I could get an update on the sales force hiring. I know you were targeting 5% growth on the sales force hires for the year. I just wanted to see how Q1 shook out.\n\n---\n\nYes, I'm not sure if -- there was confusion. We're probably more in like the 3% type of growth rate, and we felt very good about that. We've been fairly flat the last few years, didn't grow a lot in the sales force given the economy and some of the results and things that we were doing in sales. And this year, we committed to a good, strong 3% growth, and that all got completed very quickly. So we hired up between the fourth quarter and the first quarter, and we're fully staffed. A lot of training has already been done, and I think they're hitting the ground running. So feel very good about that. We really haven't put -- we've been more cautious the last couple of years. This year, we started getting back to the kind of old trends of adding 2% to 3% to the sales force in the year.\n\n---\n\nJust, Jeff, one other add to that. While the -- as Marty said, we're going to add 3%. We're actually up over that when you compare where we were in Q1 of last year. We came in a little light last year in Q1, started the year, built up and then added 3%, so we're actually above the 3%.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And I know you -- last quarter, you had called out some increased investment in the first half of the fiscal year. You were above your operating margin guided range in the first quarter. Is there any kind of pushout on your increased investment on the IT side or sales force like heading into Q2?\n\n---\n\nAs Marty said, I think we did a lot of the hiring we're going to do on sales force in Q1. IT will ramp a bit as we progress through the year. So I don't think we're way off what we were expecting.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And one final question just on -- I know it's been -- we've discussed the kind of delayed decisions on the health care reform side. Just wanted to see if there was any update on that, with clients addressing compliance requirements.\n\n---\n\nI think, Jeff, we're still getting a lot of interest. It gets us in front of a lot of clients and -- but I think that this quarter, we'll get a better sense of it again as the benefit plans -- people come up. Some are getting off exchanges. Some of the smaller clients are going to be moving to the exchanges. I think we'll get a better sense. I think we've still seen kind of a -- I wouldn't say a freeze, but kind of a hesitation to know what to do. And of course, the delay in some of the requirements for the 50 to 99, the under 100 -- 50 to 100 basically has pushed off that decision for a few more. We still feel okay. We got a very strong health insurance team out there, and they're getting in front of a lot of clients, but we are still seeing a little bit of hesitation, I think. We've got great products to help them monitor whether it applies to them, how it applies to them, give them real-time information, but we're not seeing a big uptick, at least at this point. But we do expect it will probably pick up a little bit more the next coming -- the next few months.\n\n---\n\nMarty, you highlighted an uptick in competitive takeaways recently. Could you just flesh out those comments a little bit? Why do you think your competitive takeaways are increasing? It seems that there's been an increase in innovation generally across the payroll services industry.\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, when I think -- I think we've been a big part of that innovation uptick. When you think about where we were just a few years ago versus today, online product, very strong, and we're seeing a big push here from clients looking for online products. We have a very good online product. We're continuing to add to that constantly, and the report writer and report builder products are very strong for us. And you have mobility, so we're really -- I think we have the best mobility product out there from a combined product breadth for the client. So you can have everything on your -- you can get to 1 to 2 clicks. You can do your own payroll. Your employees use it for, certainly, their paystubs and W-2s and 401(k) information. So I think we've been part of that. I think that's helped us. Between that and the great service that we've always been known for, I think, has put us in a very good position. And I think the sales team has really hit their stride in execution, particularly the last half of last year and continued into the first quarter this year. We're just doing very well. We've also gone after -- not only we've had very good referrals from CPAs over the years, but we've gone after making sure we're getting the CPAs that we hadn't in previous years, with a lot of work that Mark Bottini and the sales team are doing with more direct -- hitting CPAs that haven't necessarily referred in past years and getting into those. And the bank channel has picked up for us, as well as franchise referrals. So we've signed up not only the support of like Subway and Tim Hortons and Yum! brands and Midas, but also from banks, Union Bank and SunTrust, of course, and a number of others. We all have strong relationships. So I think all that's helping us kind of beat the competition a little bit more than we have in the past.\n\n---\n\nAlong the same vein, your primary national competitor has talked about completing their entire small business base over to a SaaS-based platform by the end of June of next year. Do you think that will have any impact on your head-to-head competitive success versus them?\n\n---\n\nI don't think so. I think for those clients who want a SaaS-based offering, we have a very good one. And what we, I think, combine very well is the dedicated personal service with that offering. So you can have a great online offering, and I'm sure competitors do, but I think we have an extremely competitive offering that we've invested in for a number of years and knew this was coming. And on top of that, just have always provided that great dedicated service, very personalized to the client, and I think that helps a lot. What we like to show a client from a sales perspective is if we're getting on with this from payroll, particularly in that under-20 range, look, you can do your payroll on your mobile phone. You can do it online. You can do it through a payroll specialist. You can change up. You can call us when you need to. You always have a dedicated person available to you. And I think that, on top of having the innovation, has done us -- has prepared us very well, even as clients move to a SaaS-based offering. We have a very strong one. And a number of our clients, a great number of our clients are on a SaaS-based offering already.\n\n---\n\nAnd David, what I'd add to what Marty said is that when a client is interested in payroll and they're searching, particularly over the Web, I've said this to many of you, we don't steer them one way or the other. If what they want is a SaaS-based solution, they want to get up and running quickly, SurePayroll is there, and they do a phenomenal job. Not every client wants that. Some clients want more service. Service matters. Make no mistake about it. We know that from research. We know at what size client service matters. If you leave yourself in a situation where you're only offering is SaaS, you expose some vulnerability because clients do value and are willing to pay for service.\n\n---\n\nJust a few sort of number questions. Just the first one for Efrain on the HRS revenue growth, the 17%. Could you just sort of help us sort of parse the benefit from the acquisition and then also the premium health care product? I know you called out what it was as a percentage of total service revenue, and if my math is right, it's, I don't know, $16.5 million of revenue. But what I was trying to understand is what the contribution to that 17% revenue growth in HRS was, along with the acquisition benefit?\n\n---\n\nYes, acquisition benefit's negligible. It really wasn't very much, so essentially nothing. On the service revenue, you said $6.5 million. That's not quite correct. I said 2.5% of total service revenue, so it's more in the $16 million range than the $6 million range.\n\n---\n\nYes, that's what I -- I said $16 million. You must have just misheard.\n\n---\n\nI'm sorry. Yes. So that was the benefit from the accounting change.\n\n---\n\nBut you restated the prior year, though, too, right?\n\n---\n\nCorrect. Yes, we did. Yes.\n\n---\n\nSo the growth contribution was less than the $16 million, right?\n\n---\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\nWe didn't have it in the first half, though.\n\n---\n\nNo, Glenn. In the first quarter, the numbers include some element of the adjustment because we -- the first quarter of last year, as restated, has workers' comp gross-up. So the right apples to apples is an addition of $16 million for the change.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And then just on the margin expectations throughout the year, you were sort of asked this question before, but obviously -- typically, your first quarter is the strongest and you're getting another strong sort of margin quarter, not as strong as the year-ago quarter, and you obviously had a very tough comparison versus a year ago. But how should we think about the seasonal pattern of the margin? Is the first quarter typically going to be -- as it is historically, going to be the strongest margin quarter of the year?\n\n---\n\nIt's typically been the pattern. I mean, it could change in a year given investments, but typically, we're going to have our strongest quarter in the first quarter. At least the trajectory, the direction, Glenn, is going to be similar to prior years.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just quickly, I can infer from your pricing commentary and your attrition commentary, it sounds like competitively, you're seeing no change. At a minimum, you feel, at least, stable, perhaps, somewhat better competitively.\n\n---\n\nYes, I would say somewhat better, Glenn. I think definitely, between the momentum of the innovation in the products that we're offering and the execution from sales, we're feeling better from a competitive standpoint. So yes, I -- we feel -- the market -- the competitive environment hasn't really changed all that much, and we feel we're even in the best position we've probably been in, in a long time.\n\n---\n\nJust to add to Marty's comment, Marty called out the recent review we got for our online product, and we don't highlight SurePayroll's numerous awards. We win a lot of technology awards. I think 7 years ago, 5 years ago, we recognized that there were investments to be made. If you look at the breadth of products that we've got, you look at nettime, you look at myStaffingPro, you look at   ExpenseWire, these are all leading products in their respective categories. So we understand this is a technology game. We are very, very clear on that. We also understand, which some people in the market seem to be forgetting, it's also a service game. And especially in the under-50 space, where we have 94% of our clients, ability to provide service is a differentiator. And while some people don't seem to be thinking it is, we've done the research and we know it is. So we feel pretty good about where we're at.\n\n---\n\nWith the checks-per-payroll growth around 1%, how much of that 1% do you think is mix maybe bringing that down versus actual hiring trends?\n\n---\n\nSo if I give you 1%, Sara, that's an apples-to-apples. So we modified the methodology a little bit using our normal methodology and also doing same store. Same store for us is about 1%. If you don't do it the other way we're doing it, there's probably a 2/10 difference. It's not significant. So the 1% probably is -- well, not probably, but is hiring within the base.\n\n---\n\nYes. And I think as we pointed out...\n\n---\n\nSo it really is -- you're seeing really slower hiring than you had been before?\n\n---\n\nI would say if you just look at our small business index, Sara, we've seen -- we're definitely -- this year has been stronger at the rate of growth in hiring in small business over last year. And even though it's been a little -- it's tempered down a little bit the last 3 out of 4 months, it's still stronger than last year. And it's definitely stronger than our base year for the index, which is 2004. It's like a whole percent stronger hiring growth rate in small businesses under 50 employees. So we still think that hiring is up over last year. Even though it tempered a little in the summer, it's still stronger than last year. And we're certainly benefiting from that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then separately, last quarter, you talked about new sales growth being the highest that you've seen, I think, it was in 7 years. Did you see continued momentum along those lines in the first quarter?\n\n---\n\nYes, definitely. Definitely, we felt that the execution continued. We're seeing not only good unit growth in the number of sales, but also holding price and gaining in kind of the revenue per client. So we're seeing very good sales execution and feel very good that, that momentum has continued, and we certainly are looking forward to continue through a big selling season here coming up.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then just last question. I wanted to clarify some things from earlier. The sales force hiring for this fiscal year, you said you've done about 3% so far. I had thought that you were thinking about planning on doing 5%. Is the target now 3%?\n\n---\n\nNo. I think that probably what happened there was we're comparing against where we were at a point prior to the year. Right now, we're about 4% -- close to 4.5% higher than we were last year. So at the end of May, we're about 4.5% higher than where we are.\n\n---\n\nSo we were down a little bit.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nIn last year, headcount -- there's a little bit more turnover. Turnover has come down a lot. And it wasn't super high last year, but it was higher than it is now. And so turnover's come down, and we were a little bit low -- below where we wanted to be last year at some points of the year. And where we are now is, besides the new hiring, everything is fully staffed; in fact, overstaffed in a few areas.\n\n---\n\nSorry, just a quick follow-up on the sales force question. Assuming normal turnover with sales force will probably stay relatively stable for the rest of the year, is that correct?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think what we're saying is it would be up. It will stay fairly stable from now, from where we are now. Yes.\n\n---\n\nThat's my question.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then just on the seasonality side, Efrain, I know you called out a few things last quarter regarding growth rates in the HRS revenue and your operating margins for each quarter. Any changes to that or anything else we need to be aware of on a seasonal basis?\n\n---\n\nNot particularly. We'll call out in next quarter's call if we see any things that are different from guidance, but no. I think the other thing, Jeff, I'd say is that if you look at the presentation that we posted -- should have posted it just recently, we have the supplemental guidance schedule at the end there. We're still within those ranges. So if you look at that closely, that's a pretty good guide for where we expect to be.\n\n---\n\nJust a couple of clarifications. What percentage of the new sales is going towards that SaaS-based solution versus more of a full-service model in core payroll?\n\n---\n\nYes. We don't break that out. We don't break that out, Bryan, specifically, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to do so. And the reason for that is that not only do we have SurePayroll, but we also have our own online product, which Marty talked about earlier. If you combine both of those, you're probably up over 1/4, maybe even 30% or so of sales in those models. That's about as definitive as we can get.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And the record sales you guys have seen, does that get us to potentially outside kind of the guided range? Are we trending above the range of kind of where we guided to for core and HR? I'm just trying to get a sense how does it translate into revenue if sales numbers seem to be doing -- kind of tracking ahead of plan.\n\n---\n\nYes. No, I don't think we're ready to start changing the guidance ranges. I would say we feel pretty comfortable that we're well within those guidance ranges. And billed revenue builds over the course of the year. And while we feel real good about Q1, we still have 3 quarters to go. We'll get a better picture as we get through the selling season, get some early signs.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just last question for me. It looked like finally we turned the corner on interest on client funds. But just expectations, we always get the question on rates and rate increases, just maybe give us an update on that.\n\n---\n\nSo our assumption is not much is going to change in this fiscal. So this fiscal goes to May. We think the real action then starts to occur in 2016. The Fed has really given a lot of very inconsistent signals. It looks like they want to raise sooner rather than later. But our planning assumption is really it's going to be a 2016 event, not a 2015 event. If they do it, obviously, we'll be happy with it but it's probably a next-year event.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just remind us, the raise of 25 basis points or just the impact of the model, just so we can get ready for it.\n\n---\n\nIt's about $4 million -- between $4 million and $5 million, that's the Cliffs Notes version. It's a little bit more complicated than that. But that's our disclosure in the Q. So yes, so we -- it starts to add up in a hurry if we get what we hope, which is a rise in short-term interest rates and the long part of the yield curve also goes up.\n\n---\n\nI just want to clarify a comment. Marty, I think you said something about moving down market with your sales force, maybe you could explain that.\n\n---\n\nNo. I made -- yes, one of the things is that we found that in selling -- our approach in the past has been a lot in the -- in what we call core payroll sell side. It's been very much to sell-in payroll. And then the other sales teams would kind of reach in over time at different stages to say, \"Hey, are you ready now for 401(k) or workers' comp or health insurance and so forth?\" And well, we've made some changes this year in saying that if you're a certain size, that we're coming in now with a combined sales force. So I guess, what I'm saying is we've kind of moved down in offering the full breadth of our services right up front in the way we approach a client. And I think we've gotten some nice traction and good stories on it already. By approaching a client with multiple sales teams together at once, if there are, let's say, 20 employees, you might go in with HR outsourcing, 401(k) and payroll all at the same time. In the past, our model was much more, \"Hey, I'll sell you payroll. And then the other teams will come in after you've had a month or 2 on the service and see if you need something else.\" So we're finding that, that kind of the need for those services, I'm sure you've seen this, has kind of pushed down over time and with the technology and the number of products available. And we think that this is a better way to capitalize on some of that is making sure the full need of the client is addressed right upfront as opposed to our traditional model, which was hitting them -- or selling them payroll right upfront.\n\n---\n\nAnd I would say one other thing, Jim, is that our sales force execution capability is really, really superb. And that's helped us to understand the potential of this integrated selling approach, and it's paying dividends. Yes.\n\n---\n\nAnd maybe just another update on how you're doing in the middle market, since I don't think we've talked about that much yet.\n\n---\n\nYes. I think there, we've offered an awful lot of products. So we're combining all that product. We're -- I think you'll see shortly we're going to kind of brand that whole thing together because we've been adding a lot of product, as Efrain said -- mentioned, myStaffingPro, ExpenseWire, our own Paychex's next-generation offerings, our time and attendance now with both our legacy product and nettime. And we're in the process of being sure -- now, we've already been selling it that way, but we're kind of bundling it all together. And we'll be announcing that shortly to kind of put a tag all the way around that, along with we've been changing some of the service model there to be sure that when you have multi-products from us, that it's handled as smoothly as possible from a multi-product standpoint. So mid-market is -- we'd always like it to be stronger, but it's doing well against the competition that's out there and -- because I think we have a full breadth of product, as well as a great sales team there.\n\n---\n\nJust following up on that last one, I guess. Are you seeing faster growth in the middle market or amongst your smaller customer base at this point, just relative to each other?\n\n---\n\nRelative, I'd say, on the small -- under 50 is stronger. I think that's the marketplace. I think that's the economy. What we're seeing is small business starting to pick up finally. Still not where it was, but that's starting to pick up. And that we're offering that approach of -- we've already been offering the larger clients, the 50 plus, the multitude of products upfront. This approach of selling the breadth of our services below 50 on the front end is our newer approach. And so I think that's -- we're picking up there a little bit faster because of that approach. Also, the referral channels that I talked about, the banking, the franchise and, of course, our continuing in the CPA referral model, it's always been strong for us, that's where you see the smaller business growth come from because these are start-ups or companies that have reached the size that are under 50, but that they need a payroll solution. So I'd definitely say that the under 50 is seeing a little bit stronger growth right now. I think that's more because of those things than anything.\n\n---\n\nAnd the change in the PEO business in terms of the self-insured plans, is that -- I get the accounting impact that you described to us. But I guess, is it driving a significant improvement or acceleration in the growth rate of that business as well? I mean, is it also helping in the unit adds in a big way because it's more attractive to people?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, it's still fairly new to us. But I -- definitely, we did it as much -- because from a competitive standpoint, we felt that it was worth taking on a little bit more of the risk and so forth because we had even a more competitive product. We still have a number of carriers. But this plan, particularly in Florida where it's a very competitive PEO market, I think put us in a great spot. We'll find out a lot more in the next quarter or so, as we get into the true selling season of benefits and so forth. But we feel very good that that's positioned us even more competitively now in the PEO.\n\n---\n\nAnd we also -- I'd just add to what Marty said. I mean, we really have a terrific PEO team and group that manages that business. So it -- I think our execution capability, our product capability have never been better.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nCan you -- would you -- in terms of the comprehensive, I know you report comprehensive HR outsourcing kind of worksite employees. Give us a rough sense how much of that is PEO at this point. How big is that business now for you guys?\n\n---\n\nYes. It's still relatively -- I should say on the gross-up -- I was going to say it was relatively small. It's still not the bulk of HRS but it's growing in importance.  Tim, the reason why I gave you a somewhat imprecise answer there is that unlike other competitors, we manage our ASO and PEO and this other smaller product we call HR Essentials, which is a lighter version of our outsourcing product together in one sales force. And we're somewhat still agnostic in terms of whether a salesperson sells a PEO or ASO. We're going to -- it's going to depend on what client needs are. HRO, HR outsourcing, is the biggest part of HR Services, and that's where we're seeing the growth in that segment of the business. PEO, ASO, for us, they're largely interchangeable, both from a financial metrics standpoint, excluding the gross-up because that has a little bit of an impact on margins. But in terms of the offering we go to market, we're willing to sell either depending on what the client wants.\n\n---\n\nYes. I think the point there that Efrain is saying, when you look at all the products combined, that outsourcing of the HR function is a significant part of our -- of the HRS business. And I think as we said in the fourth quarter, we don't give the numbers all that -- probably once a year. But we service more client employees than any competitor combined, and I think for the most part, probably any 2 competitors combined. When you combine PEO, ASO and what Efrain -- HRE, kind of an essential offering, we're the largest HR outsourcer in that product set. So we're very proud of that, and that growth is going very well.\n\n---\n\nI'm wondering if we could just go back to an earlier question because I -- maybe I just misunderstood. But when we look at the growth year-over-year of 17% in that HRS line, to get an apples-to-apples number, should we be backing out $16 million of this-year revenue? Because that's...\n\n---\n\nYes. Yes, about that, $16 million. Yes, that's correct.\n\n---\n\nSo it looks like then the growth rate was about 10% year-over-year. Does that sound right to you?\n\n---\n\nNot too far off.\n\n---\n\nRight. And is that -- I don't know if I've got good comps for the year, for the fiscal '15 year. So is that a deceleration from what we saw last year or last year's numbers...\n\n---\n\nIt's comparable to Q4 of last year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then -- but the guidance for the year is -- how do we normalize that guidance for the...\n\n---\n\nYes, yes. So I think we went through that, David. So we have a 16% to 19% guidance range, and we said about 5% of it is the PEO -- 16% to 19% HRS to be precise, and minus 5%. So you pick the number you feel makes most sense. So I think the gist to your question, not reading in too much, is that we expect HRS to accelerate as the year goes on.\n\n---\n\nRight. And what is the basis for that based on? Because you guys generally have a pretty good visibility in your business. So...\n\n---\n\nYes. We think -- I think there's probably 3 things on that. One is we expect insurance services to accelerate as we go through the year. That's a function of a number of things, not the least of which is being fully staffed and anniversary-ing some compares in that business that were tough last year. That's one. And then I think, as Marty said, we've talked a lot on this call, just the growth and the momentum in HR outsourcing services, we think, continues to build through the quarters and through the year.\n\n---\n\nRight. And just on that last point, is there anything we should be thinking about in the context of what's going on either with the Affordable Care Act or the regulatory environment at large that would make us more optimistic or less optimistic over the next 12 to 18 months?\n\n---\n\nYes. I'll let Marty talk to kind of compliance-related products, which is its own sort of set of discussion. But I do want to clarify that our guidance doesn't assume that there's some material change in what we're seeing in terms of uptake of some of the compliance-related products, which Marty can talk to in a second. We just started looking at, based on the rate and on our plan, where we expect to be as the year progresses.\n\n---\n\nYes. I think in general, David, it's not getting any less regulated. Everything is getting more complex. And so one, regulations aren't going to get easier. And so -- and health care reform just continues to drive a lot of confusion at all levels as to when it's kicking in, what does it mean for them. And I think it's probably still pretty fluid from the way things have been. Second, the technology has gotten a lot better. The innovation has gotten a lot better, in our -- in, for example, our products and in other products -- other competitors' products that drive the ability to use HR services online at a lower level of client size -- employee size. And so a lot of that has come down because the technology and the products have gotten better. And I think that that's still -- that bodes well for us. We talk about time and attendance and we talk about HR administration online products that we have. These used to be 50 plus solidly, 50 to 100 plus. They've come down. Many clients are using them now. And the mobility offerings make it a lot easier as well. We find that the mobility offerings are being used by clients for everything from their employee contact list to reviewing an employee's 401(k) with them right -- face to face, just looking at their mobile app. So all that bodes well, I think, for demand for HR online, payroll online and a lot of the other -- and we didn't even really touch on 401(k), but 401(k) continues to be very strong as well. And I think the market leaves it always a little shaky on 401(k), whether to jump in or, but we're certainly seeing assets increase. And our initiative on large market, larger plans has started to pick up and pay some dividends as well.\n\n---\n\nYes. And just to build on Marty -- just focused almost exclusively on HR outsourcing, but we also expect that our retirement services revenue is going to build through the year too.\n\n---\n\nRight. And just one last thing, again, based on a comment you made earlier. If the quarter came in perhaps a little bit stronger than you had anticipated, and again, that you typically have pretty good visibility on your business going into a year, let alone a quarter, can you help us better understand what the components were that maybe kind of drove a slightly better result than you had anticipated?\n\n---\n\nYes. That would -- David, I think I'd just leave it that -- to say we thought we had a strong quarter. We were pleased with it. If -- we were happy with what we saw on the payroll services side, and HRS continued to perform strongly. I'm cautious about getting too granular about projecting Q1 trends for the remainder of the year, because as I said earlier, we try to give annual guidance and stick with that so we don't get into a quarter-over-quarter conversation. And the only thing I'd caveat is, is the selling season is important to us. And it's good to start well. It's much, much better to finish well. And so we will continue to work on doing that, so we can continue to deliver good results.\n\n---\n\nWanted to -- you just touched on it, but my question was about the 401(k) and retirement services business on 2 fronts. First was I remember, I guess, it's probably within the last couple of years, there was some shift towards different kind of plans that I think was sort of hurting the revenue growth relative to asset or account growth in that business. I'm just sort of curious if we have sort of cycled through that and there's not any kind of revenue issue relative to account growth or asset values that would have been a headwind like you transitioned through. And the second one...\n\n---\n\nI think [indiscernible] -- I'm sorry, go ahead.\n\n---\n\nNo. And then the second part of the question, if I could, was just, again, you talked about the confidence you have in that business. Just anything specific to sales or product or if there are different referral channels that may be more productive around 401(k) and retirement services that you're focused on or have sort of figured out some opportunities around the sales management referral channels to help that business?\n\n---\n\nI'll let Marty take the second part. So the first part, Tim, I think you may be referring to the fact that about 2 years ago or so, we decided to take a portion of the retirement services sales force and dedicate them to the upmarket. When we did that, we took people who were servicing the smaller market out and didn't necessarily replace those. So we had a little bit of a transition in that business as we did that, as the larger market reps were starting to ramp up. So we've anniversary-ed that. We think that the larger market reps are doing a really good job in execution. It's helped our growth rates in retirement services and feel that we've got a nice runway in front of us. You can see that in part by the amount of the growth in assets. That hasn't been just market growth but it's also been plan growth, meaning more plans and larger plans. So I think we're past that anniversary. I'll let Marty talk to the second...\n\n---\n\nYes. And I think Efrain pretty much covered it. I think the other thing we were doing was having a team that builds a lot more -- focuses on relationships with the financial advisers. And I think that that's really starting to pay some dividends there. We're -- it takes time to kind of build that relationship, so that they trust us going in to not only a brand-new client, but to go with a larger client and a conversion of a larger asset base. And we're really starting to pick up, I think, some momentum there and some trust from financial advisers to not just give us the start-ups, but the larger clients as well. And I think to us, that gives us confidence that we're going to see the year either as we predicted or a little bit stronger.\n\n---\n\nWith regards -- just staying on the 401(k) for a second. So what sort of level of growth should we anticipate, roughly speaking, on retirement services?\n\n---\n\nWe don't -- Mark, obviously, we don't break that out. It doesn't grow quite as quickly as HRS overall, but it's a little bit less than that.\n\n---\n\nJust a little bit less than what? The organic underlying growth rate?\n\n---\n\nHRS overall. Yes, organic underlying growth. Thanks for the clarification.\n\n---\n\nAnd then with regards to the health care offering on the PEO side, how should we think about the profitability of that?\n\n---\n\nThe profitability of the...\n\n---\n\nThe minimum premium plan health care option.\n\n---\n\nYes. That's an interesting discussion that's probably worth a long, long time. But for purposes of the financial statement, it's a pass-through. It's actually a little bit more complex than that, simply because you do -- you can make some money on the plan. But what ends up happening is that, that just helps you to be that much more competitive in the future and buy down future rates. But from the standpoint of financial -- or financial results, it's largely a pass-through. Whatever your expenses are, you are not permitted to take a margin on those expenses.\n\n---\n\nSo it sounds like the reality of what we should think about, from an economic perspective, would basically be that 11% to 14% growth on an underlying basis is really where we should focus?\n\n---\n\nThat's right. That's right. Yes.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then with regards to the core, really glad to hear about how things are shaping up. Can you talk a little bit about some of the sales force metrics with regards to both the turnover rate, as well as the percentage of salespeople that are currently running at your historical quota rates?\n\n---\n\nYes. They are -- one, for turnover, it's a little bit below where we've been historically. Kind of historical average is in that 30% to 35% turnover rate. We're at the low end of that range right now. Now that can always change. But for first quarter, it's been very good. The recruiting, I think, of the new reps has been very good. So I think we're picking up a very good quality of new reps. And the training consistently has been revamped and so forth. I think it's very good execution of the leadership team across the board, from the senior team right to the district sales managers, just feel like a good experience level now in that team and that they've done very well. So I mean, when you look at the metrics, and I think I've said this, the units, what they're selling, the number of units is good as well as holding price. So that to us bodes well from an experience level and execution of the reps. So they're not just going in selling price and we're getting more units at a low price. We're getting unit growth and revenue-per-unit growth. So again, first quarter, but we're feeling positive about the execution of that sales team from those kind of metrics.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And is there a sizable percentage that are now approaching our old historical prerecession quota rates?\n\n---\n\nI don't know if I'll go that far. It's -- I would say that from an annualized revenue perspective, they're certainly showing some promise. But I don't think -- again, the economy isn't where it was prerecession. But I'd say relative to the last few years and last year when we started to see really the best in 7 years, we're still at that level. So it's definitely the best we've seen since the recession and it continues to go up. I wouldn't say it's right at that prerecession levels yet though.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then one last one. Marty, with regards to the commentary in terms of the competitive takeaways, I missed that in terms of who that's coming from. Can you...\n\n---\n\nNo, because I don't think I said. But I -- so didn't list the exact names there. But it certainly is the national player and -- as well as the regionals, more regional players. I think what you're seeing is national player, I think what we're doing very well is selling the value of our service combined with the technology, and that means that they can be online or they can be a SaaS offering that's online with mobile or full service. I think from the regional players what you're seeing is, particularly smaller players in the market, they're struggling more with the technology. They don't have the mobility offerings. They don't have the online offerings. These are changing constantly. We're updating our mobile offerings probably every quarter with something new. And these -- the smaller players just can't -- you just can't keep up with that technology now. And we're finding that clients are really using it. At the beginning, it was sporadic use. It's a lot of use now. Not so much doing their payroll, but for reports, for information or working with their employees on issues, they're using the mobility a lot. So...\n\n---\n\nYes. I had a question on the PEO business, clearly healthy growth there. Can you characterize what, if any, risks you take on as you grow this business, and sort of what the mitigation approaches are around that?\n\n---\n\nYes. So Lisa, there's 2 risks that everyone takes on who is in the PEO business: It's the quality of the workers' comp underwriting; and then secondarily, although we have talked a lot about minimum premium plans, we still have a lot of health insurance plans that are not under this cost-sharing arrangement. In the cost-sharing arrangements, and I should say the risk-sharing arrangements, if your health care book is not what you expected it to be, you can end up with having more health care costs than you gauged, and same thing with workers' comp. We use a number of sets of actuaries. I'm pretty familiar with the underwriting process in both areas. And we set the probabilities that we will exceed our targets at a very, very low rate. Meaning, when we ask our actuaries to do projections of what we think the costs are, we are not asking them to do a 95% probability. Typically, we're asking them to set it at 99-plus percent. So on the workers' comp side, we have done that over a number of years and have very, very good results managing books, our books of business on the workers' comp side. And we feel pretty comfortable. We have very deep expertise on the health care side, understanding and assessing risks; and in the last year, really built up our underwriting capability and our management capability in the PEO. So feel pretty comfortable. Wouldn't go down this route if we didn't.\n\n---\n\nYes. And has that been sort of the rate-limiting factor on growth in the business, given we're seeing healthy growth in the PEO businesses kind of across the industry, and the economics, coming in new to this space, right, the economics to you and the economics to the client appear to be pretty compelling? So I'm just trying to understand like really nice healthy growth, but why isn't that faster? Does it end up being the underwriting components of it that kind of rate limits that?\n\n---\n\nNo. I think it's one element of it. But Marty faces the decision around how to make trade-offs with investments in -- across a number of different sales forces that are growing. And so I would say 2 or 3 years ago, people who followed us closely knew we struggled a little bit in the PEO, took a breather, retooled and have really gotten ourselves back in the game. So I think our level of investment in that sales force is commensurate with what we think the opportunity is right now. One other thing I would add to that is that it's not just PEO for us that's an important element of what we sell in HRO, but we have a very, very strong ASO business, which is very similar to PEO but doesn't have some of the risk characteristics that the PEO does. So we're looking at it a bit more holistically than other competitors do.\n\n---\n\nTerrific. And real quick on the core payroll business. You mentioned that you're seeing continued growth in number of clients in core payroll. I know you don't disclose that on a quarterly basis, but can you kind of bound that? I know in this past fiscal year, it went up above 1% for the first time in several years. Are we sort of still running in that trajectory, stronger, weaker?\n\n---\n\nSo we're -- we -- so last year, we finished at about 2%. We're certainly in that range.\n\n---\n\nJust quickly on the competitive takeaway question. I caught the national and the regional. But what about against point solution providers? You made it pretty clear that service is still in high demand. How about the competitive takeaway versus point solution providers?\n\n---\n\nOkay, so define your definition, Tien-tsin, of...\n\n---\n\nYes. So I'm thinking about point -- thinking about, let's call it payroll-only player or benefits-only provider, only 401(k) administrator. I'm just trying to think about unbundling all the different HRS solutions out there and see if maybe those are drifting in your direction. Does that make sense, Efrain?\n\n---\n\nYes, yes, that makes sense.\n\n---\n\nAnd I think that, that is -- we tend to do very well. Again, I think the demand for the HR, kind of the overlapping services is pushed down in the market and so -- with the technology and the offerings and so forth. And so I think point -- the point service -- kind of the point providers, as you'd say, I think it's tougher for them to sell by themselves. And the better you can integrate that experience and make it easier for the client, they do -- more and more clients need multiple services, and they're not as interested in \"Hey, I'm going to take things from 3 different providers.\" So the key is okay now -- and you can see what we've acquired over the years, we brought in these great point solutions, and the key is to integrate them as seamlessly as possible from a service perspective for the client, so that you're adding a lot more value. They don't have the time or the desire anymore to integrate themselves, the clients, to integrate 3 different products, and -- I don't think. And so it's all a matter of integrating it in together. And that's what we've continued to do and will continue to work on.\n\n---\n\nAnd, Tien-tsin, in the under-50 space particularly, it may be different in the enterprise space, what clients value about what -- one of the many things that clients value in that space is the ability to have one single point of access and access to your data. So single sign-on is really, really big. And then when that single sign-on is coupled with your ability to access all of the different aspects of the data that you're trying to manage, be it health and benefits, 401(k), HR outsourcing, that's really the compelling proposition. It may be different in the enterprise space. But in the -- certainly, in the under-50 space, they're looking for that integration, as Marty said.\n\n---\n\nYes, that makes sense. Just my only follow-on is just I know there's a lot of questions on the 3%, the sales force increase. But given the single point of access, the salesperson is now required to be smart on a lot of different subjects, so does that change your comp structure or even your go-to-market and how you touch the client?\n\n---\n\nNo, not really. I mean, I think we've had -- we're very competitive. First of all, from the comp structure, we always make changes to be sure we stay very competitive on that. But also, we're doing a lot of team selling. So the point I was trying to make earlier is that where we've come down now -- where that was always the approach, very much the approach that we had in the 50-plus, below-50 now and probably even in that 20-and-above range, there's a lot more team selling going on. So we have expertise. It's not necessarily expecting the rep to know everything. It's saying, hey, when you used to go in and sell payroll, and then your 401(k) sales team would come in a month later or 2 months later or 6 months later, now we go in together as a team on a lot of these leads and say, \"What's the full breadth of what the client needs,\" and look to sell them upfront. So it's not necessarily requiring a lot more from each individual salesperson, but more of a team approach to the way we're selling, which seems to be getting some traction now. I think the market's ready for it, and I think we're going to -- we will execute it well.\n\n---\n\nOkay. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived until October 24. Our Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held October 15 at 10 a.m. in Rochester, New York, and that meeting will also be broadcast over the Internet as well. I thank you for your -- taking the time to participate in our call and your interest in Paychex. Have a great day.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Georgios Mihalos (Analysts)】\nI wanted to kick it off on the payroll growth side, a 4.5% number, sort of at the high end of your 3% to 5% range. Just curious, is there any reason why you wouldn't be narrowing the range, say, to 4% to 5% from the 3% to 5%? The 3% seems conservative, even if we're only in the first quarter. Just wondering if you're seeing [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, George, thanks. So I guess it's a philosophy issue, so I should state what the philosophy is. What we try to do when we come into the year is say what do we think the ranges are for the year as a whole, so we don't have to revise every quarter guidance. We try to call out if, somehow, a quarter falls -- is a little bit unusual in terms of the guidance. So yes, I would say at the bottom end right now, 3% is pretty conservative. We absolutely start a little bit better than that number, but we still feel comfortable with the overall guidance range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Georgios Mihalos (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then I wanted to switch gears as it relates to your payroll card program or initiative, the partnership with Skylight that you have. Any color you can provide there as to demand for payroll cards? And I just wanted to get a sense, is a payroll card more profitable to Paychex than a standard check?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. I wouldn't say it's more profitable. It's not necessarily more profitable because we have a partner, obviously, involved in providing it. I'd say the demand for it, George, has been consistent but not huge. I think we were one of the first to have a payroll card over 10 years ago. And it just -- it has a small kind of grouping, those that are unbanked, for example, and so forth. And while we've seen that go up and down a little bit over time, more and more people want one card. If they're banked, they want one card. They don't want a separate payroll card. So I would say that the demand is consistent. We really like the product that we're involved with now and think that, that may pick up demand a little bit. But it's one of those things where we just like to offer a full wide range of offerings to the client as to however they want to receive their pay.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Siva Borra (Analysts)】\nJust with regards to your investments in sales force, when do you expect to see the benefits come through? Is it more second half-weighted, or we should start seeing movements in first half as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. As I said, I think we got off to a good start. I think the new headcount that we've added in the last quarter, I think you'll see more of those benefits the second half of the year as they get -- we have a great training program, but obviously, they get trained, they start building their relationships with CPAs and other channels. And I think you'll see that more the second half of the year. But we're -- but we feel like we're off to a very good start. We continued in -- from Q4 and feel good about both sales units and revenue from the perspective, particularly of payroll.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Siva Borra (Analysts)】\nAnd probably just a follow-on on that. What's the split between the sales force recruitment in payroll and HRS segments?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nAs far as what the additions were?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Siva Borra (Analysts)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nThe additions were a little stronger on the payroll side. We felt that, that was starting to pick up again in the second half of last year. And so most of -- much of the adds -- we don't break it out exactly, but much of the adds were on the payroll side and -- because we felt we're very well positioned down the HRS services side.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Smittipon Srethapramote (Analysts)】\nI just wanted to just get some more color on the PEO segment, how it's tracking. And maybe you can give us an update in terms of how pricing is developing on the PEO side.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI would say we felt really strong about the last half of the year from a competitive standpoint, where we feel very competitive. They've done very well with the carriers. The new plan, as Efrain mentioned, we think, has put us in an even better competitive position in the Florida area, and so we feel very good. We're off to a -- the big months are kind of coming in now this quarter. It's what's coming up for the benefit plans and so forth. But we feel very strong, fully staffed on the sales side, a lot of experience in that team. And of course, we offer both the PEO and the ASO version. So what's good about the way, I believe, we offer it is whatever the client needs to get the most value out of the service we have to offer them. But we feel very good about the PEO side and our opportunity here coming up, particularly this second quarter, as we see benefit plans get subscribed to.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. I'd just add that we're positioned, certainly, as -- in the market as well as we've ever been positioned. The addition of the minimum premium plan really helps in Florida, but we're seeing good demand across other markets. So the only caution or caveat I'd put on that is that third quarter is a big quarter for PEO, and that's where you see kind of how much you're winning the battle. So we feel good about where we started. Still, the year needs to play out a bit more.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Smittipon Srethapramote (Analysts)】\nGot it. And maybe just a follow-up on nettime solutions. Can you just give us some more color in terms of the level of traction that you're getting with that new offering and maybe compare that to your legacy T&A product? And are there any other product sets that you're looking to buy -- or to build or buy to improve your overall product portfolio at the moment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. Right now, we're feeling very good about the portfolio of products. nettime was an opportunity that we felt we had a -- it was a real market leader there and that the team would fit very well and would fit into our SaaS products. We're seeing good traction, really, out of the gate as we integrate it into our payroll offering, which will come in stages. But then -- and then there's organic growth that we've continued at nettime itself. So we feel good about their organic growth, which they'll sell directly, and integrating it into our payroll platform. We've already had a number of sales. We're training everyone in our team on the product, and so you'll see a good combination of sales from the organic and the tie-in to Paychex. The integration takes a little bit of time, so -- but that will be coming up in the next quarter or so. So we're very pleased with the product. Whole management team is in place at nettime. Leadership is taking a very strong role, and it's just a great cultural fit with the company. So we feel very good about where this is. The legacy product has been very strong. We had a good, strong year last year. And we'll just kind of phase -- the legacy product has a little more, for us, integrated bells and whistles on it, which we're introducing, actually, even this quarter or next quarter. You'll see not only Web-punch online but complete mobility punch as well, time punches. And so we'll still be building on the legacy product for a little bit until we get nettime fully integrated in. But we're really pleased with the product and everything that it offers.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nThey had a really nice track record of growing that business over 60% over the last 3 years, and it's a good example of the kind of acquisitions we like, smaller. We buy them to grow them, not for growth, and good product set, good management. And they're off to a good start.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Smittipon Srethapramote (Analysts)】\nOkay. Maybe just one last quick question is if you can give us an update on the retention ratio, retention rates that you're seeing in your business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, very similar to last year. We're really ahead, from our perspective, on retention, so very strong. It probably -- still historic best for the company. From a payroll retention standpoint, we feel very good. So not only the sales have great momentum but the retention is right up there with our historic best, and we haven't seen any change in that. Obviously, big quarters coming up here with year-end, but so far, we're feeling very good about the retention.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Kupferberg (Analysts)】\nI wanted to just ask a little bit about new business formation, get some general observations from you guys on whether you think we're stable or is there any improvement there. I know it's obviously an important source of new sales and growth for Paychex.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. So Jason, 2 answers to that. It'd be great if we had real-time data on what's going on in the economy. In the absence of that, we've noticed a trend ticking up on our sales to newly formed businesses. And it seems like over a number of quarters now, we seem to be picking up in that area. And if you go back a couple of years ago, we weren't seeing that trend. That now seems to be evident. It looks like you're getting better business formation. But of course, we're kind of an indirect -- or our observation on that is indirect. Our sales to new businesses are up.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Kupferberg (Analysts)】\nOkay. Is there any way to get a feel, either qualitatively or quantitatively, whether or not that's reflective of any kind of share shift in terms of who's winning new businesses? Or is it -- is there not enough data to really call that out?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, there really isn't enough data to pull it out. It's very difficult to get that granular for new business sales. And I would tend to ascribe it a little bit more to some underlying growth in new businesses, and then I think we're getting better at execution, too.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. I think we have felt good about the win -- kind of the win-loss ratio against competitors, but we are definitely seeing an uptick in the sales from competitors and kind of an -- we look at it from a net gain from competitors. And we're definitely an uptick and a positive at this point as we started to see that the second half of last year, too. So Efrain's right. It's hard -- we're still not at the full new business creation that we were prerecession. It's certainly up, but it's not where it was based on everything we see. But as Efrain said, new sales -- sales to new businesses are up, and definitely, the gain from competitors is up, so we're feeling very good about that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Kupferberg (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just on pricing, are you still kind of trending closer to the lower end of your 2% to 4% range? And I wanted to just get a feel in terms of contract renewals in general. What percent of those are currently being done with a unit price increase versus how many are flat and how many have a unit price decrease? And has there been any change in those relative percentages over the past, I don't know, year or so?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. So Jason, so what we said is 2% to 4%. I would say we're floating off the bottom of that, a little bit closer to the middle of it. We do not give uniform price increases, so that's experienced a little bit differently by different customers. And we also don't have contracts. So one of the things that does differentiate us is that virtually across every single customer that we have, if we don't earn our keep from a service standpoint, you can get to walk without penalties. We do a little bit of that in the mid-market, but that's a relatively small part of our business.  So I would say the pricing environment's easing somewhat.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, and we feel good about -- now that we're through that first quarter, we have not seen a lot of fallout from the price increase. And so that's always a good determining factor in that first quarter. We would see it typically in the July, August time frame, and we haven't, so...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Kupferberg (Analysts)】\nOkay. Just my last question. Any updates you wanted to provide on the Brazil JV or what's happening overseas in Germany and your payment processing offering as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. I'd say Brazil is off to a good start. There was a delay in the -- in some of the electronic filing requirements that we had expected the government had put in place. They delayed for a year. But we're off to a pretty good start. We're not -- we don't give exact client growth, but we feel very good about the start that we've had there since January. And in Germany, we're -- sales are above plan, so they're continuing to do well. And we're always looking for other ways to grow Germany even faster and the other -- Brazil as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nEfrain, as you look at the results that you reported for the first quarter, would you say -- were they in line with your internal plans, or were you a little bit ahead of internal plans?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nCrickets, right? We felt pretty good about the first quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nAll right. So Efrain, the balance sheet looks amazing still. You have a lot of cash on hand. Any thoughts as to what you would like to do with that cash? I know you have a share buyback in place, and I'm just -- beyond that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, so we do have an opportunity to buy shares back. We have bought to date, including last year, about 7 million shares. We're significantly below where the -- we purchased those significantly below where the stock is trading. We thought -- obviously thought that, that made a lot of sense. Where we see opportunities to go in and buy, we will do that opportunistically. We think that makes sense. But the other thing is we have a good pipeline of acquisition opportunities. We want to keep our powder dry. We are -- as all of you know, we don't tend to do stupid acquisitions just to grow. And we like some properties out there. Now whether they're going to -- there's going to be something that we see over the course of the year, we'll evaluate that. And if we're getting to the end of the year and we have a significant cash buildup, then we'll have to have a discussion with the board about what next steps would be there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nAnd then, Marty, just on the Paychex Accounting Online business, how it's progressing, where you are, if you think you need to change the business model at all.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nWell, I think the biggest thing we're learning is how to really acquire the clients and kind of get them -- and I guess to even step back further, get them to even -- to realize it's a great accounting product that we've invested in with Kashoo. And this has been out there for a while. It's a strong online accounting product, more of a bookkeeping type of software-as-a-service. But they still come to Paychex for payroll, benefits and outsourcing. And while the reputation is very strong there, they're not always -- it's a different marketing game to teach them about the accounting or bookkeeping online that we have available to them. So I think the biggest thing -- I wouldn't really change much. We may get a little more aggressive as far as getting to our own clients and getting them to understand that we have this nice offering that, I think, is going to be a real benefit and value to them. So probably more from a marketing standpoint, we're trying to see if we can get the knowledge that it's out there and that it's us and it has all the power and the strength of Paychex behind it. That's the biggest thing. Other than that, we're really pleased with the product. We're just -- I think we're just finding that the marketing is a little bit different in the approach and so forth. And we expect that to start to pick up.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Rossetti (Analysts)】\nThis is Jeff Rossetti in for Joe. I just wanted to see if I could get an update on the sales force hiring. I know you were targeting 5% growth on the sales force hires for the year. I just wanted to see how Q1 shook out.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I'm not sure if -- there was confusion. We're probably more in like the 3% type of growth rate, and we felt very good about that. We've been fairly flat the last few years, didn't grow a lot in the sales force given the economy and some of the results and things that we were doing in sales. And this year, we committed to a good, strong 3% growth, and that all got completed very quickly. So we hired up between the fourth quarter and the first quarter, and we're fully staffed. A lot of training has already been done, and I think they're hitting the ground running. So feel very good about that. We really haven't put -- we've been more cautious the last couple of years. This year, we started getting back to the kind of old trends of adding 2% to 3% to the sales force in the year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nJust, Jeff, one other add to that. While the -- as Marty said, we're going to add 3%. We're actually up over that when you compare where we were in Q1 of last year. We came in a little light last year in Q1, started the year, built up and then added 3%, so we're actually above the 3%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Rossetti (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And I know you -- last quarter, you had called out some increased investment in the first half of the fiscal year. You were above your operating margin guided range in the first quarter. Is there any kind of pushout on your increased investment on the IT side or sales force like heading into Q2?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nAs Marty said, I think we did a lot of the hiring we're going to do on sales force in Q1. IT will ramp a bit as we progress through the year. So I don't think we're way off what we were expecting.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Rossetti (Analysts)】\nOkay. And one final question just on -- I know it's been -- we've discussed the kind of delayed decisions on the health care reform side. Just wanted to see if there was any update on that, with clients addressing compliance requirements.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think, Jeff, we're still getting a lot of interest. It gets us in front of a lot of clients and -- but I think that this quarter, we'll get a better sense of it again as the benefit plans -- people come up. Some are getting off exchanges. Some of the smaller clients are going to be moving to the exchanges. I think we'll get a better sense. I think we've still seen kind of a -- I wouldn't say a freeze, but kind of a hesitation to know what to do. And of course, the delay in some of the requirements for the 50 to 99, the under 100 -- 50 to 100 basically has pushed off that decision for a few more. We still feel okay. We got a very strong health insurance team out there, and they're getting in front of a lot of clients, but we are still seeing a little bit of hesitation, I think. We've got great products to help them monitor whether it applies to them, how it applies to them, give them real-time information, but we're not seeing a big uptick, at least at this point. But we do expect it will probably pick up a little bit more the next coming -- the next few months.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Togut (Analysts)】\nMarty, you highlighted an uptick in competitive takeaways recently. Could you just flesh out those comments a little bit? Why do you think your competitive takeaways are increasing? It seems that there's been an increase in innovation generally across the payroll services industry.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. Well, when I think -- I think we've been a big part of that innovation uptick. When you think about where we were just a few years ago versus today, online product, very strong, and we're seeing a big push here from clients looking for online products. We have a very good online product. We're continuing to add to that constantly, and the report writer and report builder products are very strong for us. And you have mobility, so we're really -- I think we have the best mobility product out there from a combined product breadth for the client. So you can have everything on your -- you can get to 1 to 2 clicks. You can do your own payroll. Your employees use it for, certainly, their paystubs and W-2s and 401(k) information. So I think we've been part of that. I think that's helped us. Between that and the great service that we've always been known for, I think, has put us in a very good position. And I think the sales team has really hit their stride in execution, particularly the last half of last year and continued into the first quarter this year. We're just doing very well. We've also gone after -- not only we've had very good referrals from CPAs over the years, but we've gone after making sure we're getting the CPAs that we hadn't in previous years, with a lot of work that Mark Bottini and the sales team are doing with more direct -- hitting CPAs that haven't necessarily referred in past years and getting into those. And the bank channel has picked up for us, as well as franchise referrals. So we've signed up not only the support of like Subway and Tim Hortons and Yum! brands and Midas, but also from banks, Union Bank and SunTrust, of course, and a number of others. We all have strong relationships. So I think all that's helping us kind of beat the competition a little bit more than we have in the past.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Togut (Analysts)】\nAlong the same vein, your primary national competitor has talked about completing their entire small business base over to a SaaS-based platform by the end of June of next year. Do you think that will have any impact on your head-to-head competitive success versus them?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI don't think so. I think for those clients who want a SaaS-based offering, we have a very good one. And what we, I think, combine very well is the dedicated personal service with that offering. So you can have a great online offering, and I'm sure competitors do, but I think we have an extremely competitive offering that we've invested in for a number of years and knew this was coming. And on top of that, just have always provided that great dedicated service, very personalized to the client, and I think that helps a lot. What we like to show a client from a sales perspective is if we're getting on with this from payroll, particularly in that under-20 range, look, you can do your payroll on your mobile phone. You can do it online. You can do it through a payroll specialist. You can change up. You can call us when you need to. You always have a dedicated person available to you. And I think that, on top of having the innovation, has done us -- has prepared us very well, even as clients move to a SaaS-based offering. We have a very strong one. And a number of our clients, a great number of our clients are on a SaaS-based offering already.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nAnd David, what I'd add to what Marty said is that when a client is interested in payroll and they're searching, particularly over the Web, I've said this to many of you, we don't steer them one way or the other. If what they want is a SaaS-based solution, they want to get up and running quickly, SurePayroll is there, and they do a phenomenal job. Not every client wants that. Some clients want more service. Service matters. Make no mistake about it. We know that from research. We know at what size client service matters. If you leave yourself in a situation where you're only offering is SaaS, you expose some vulnerability because clients do value and are willing to pay for service.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Glenn Greene (Analysts)】\nJust a few sort of number questions. Just the first one for Efrain on the HRS revenue growth, the 17%. Could you just sort of help us sort of parse the benefit from the acquisition and then also the premium health care product? I know you called out what it was as a percentage of total service revenue, and if my math is right, it's, I don't know, $16.5 million of revenue. But what I was trying to understand is what the contribution to that 17% revenue growth in HRS was, along with the acquisition benefit?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, acquisition benefit's negligible. It really wasn't very much, so essentially nothing. On the service revenue, you said $6.5 million. That's not quite correct. I said 2.5% of total service revenue, so it's more in the $16 million range than the $6 million range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Glenn Greene (Analysts)】\nYes, that's what I -- I said $16 million. You must have just misheard.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI'm sorry. Yes. So that was the benefit from the accounting change.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Glenn Greene (Analysts)】\nBut you restated the prior year, though, too, right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nCorrect. Yes, we did. Yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Glenn Greene (Analysts)】\nSo the growth contribution was less than the $16 million, right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nNo.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nWe didn't have it in the first half, though.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nNo, Glenn. In the first quarter, the numbers include some element of the adjustment because we -- the first quarter of last year, as restated, has workers' comp gross-up. So the right apples to apples is an addition of $16 million for the change.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Glenn Greene (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's helpful. And then just on the margin expectations throughout the year, you were sort of asked this question before, but obviously -- typically, your first quarter is the strongest and you're getting another strong sort of margin quarter, not as strong as the year-ago quarter, and you obviously had a very tough comparison versus a year ago. But how should we think about the seasonal pattern of the margin? Is the first quarter typically going to be -- as it is historically, going to be the strongest margin quarter of the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nIt's typically been the pattern. I mean, it could change in a year given investments, but typically, we're going to have our strongest quarter in the first quarter. At least the trajectory, the direction, Glenn, is going to be similar to prior years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Glenn Greene (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just quickly, I can infer from your pricing commentary and your attrition commentary, it sounds like competitively, you're seeing no change. At a minimum, you feel, at least, stable, perhaps, somewhat better competitively.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I would say somewhat better, Glenn. I think definitely, between the momentum of the innovation in the products that we're offering and the execution from sales, we're feeling better from a competitive standpoint. So yes, I -- we feel -- the market -- the competitive environment hasn't really changed all that much, and we feel we're even in the best position we've probably been in, in a long time.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nJust to add to Marty's comment, Marty called out the recent review we got for our online product, and we don't highlight SurePayroll's numerous awards. We win a lot of technology awards. I think 7 years ago, 5 years ago, we recognized that there were investments to be made. If you look at the breadth of products that we've got, you look at nettime, you look at myStaffingPro, you look at   ExpenseWire, these are all leading products in their respective categories. So we understand this is a technology game. We are very, very clear on that. We also understand, which some people in the market seem to be forgetting, it's also a service game. And especially in the under-50 space, where we have 94% of our clients, ability to provide service is a differentiator. And while some people don't seem to be thinking it is, we've done the research and we know it is. So we feel pretty good about where we're at.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sara Gubins (Analysts)】\nWith the checks-per-payroll growth around 1%, how much of that 1% do you think is mix maybe bringing that down versus actual hiring trends?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nSo if I give you 1%, Sara, that's an apples-to-apples. So we modified the methodology a little bit using our normal methodology and also doing same store. Same store for us is about 1%. If you don't do it the other way we're doing it, there's probably a 2/10 difference. It's not significant. So the 1% probably is -- well, not probably, but is hiring within the base.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. And I think as we pointed out...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sara Gubins (Analysts)】\nSo it really is -- you're seeing really slower hiring than you had been before?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI would say if you just look at our small business index, Sara, we've seen -- we're definitely -- this year has been stronger at the rate of growth in hiring in small business over last year. And even though it's been a little -- it's tempered down a little bit the last 3 out of 4 months, it's still stronger than last year. And it's definitely stronger than our base year for the index, which is 2004. It's like a whole percent stronger hiring growth rate in small businesses under 50 employees. So we still think that hiring is up over last year. Even though it tempered a little in the summer, it's still stronger than last year. And we're certainly benefiting from that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sara Gubins (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then separately, last quarter, you talked about new sales growth being the highest that you've seen, I think, it was in 7 years. Did you see continued momentum along those lines in the first quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, definitely. Definitely, we felt that the execution continued. We're seeing not only good unit growth in the number of sales, but also holding price and gaining in kind of the revenue per client. So we're seeing very good sales execution and feel very good that, that momentum has continued, and we certainly are looking forward to continue through a big selling season here coming up.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sara Gubins (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then just last question. I wanted to clarify some things from earlier. The sales force hiring for this fiscal year, you said you've done about 3% so far. I had thought that you were thinking about planning on doing 5%. Is the target now 3%?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nNo. I think that probably what happened there was we're comparing against where we were at a point prior to the year. Right now, we're about 4% -- close to 4.5% higher than we were last year. So at the end of May, we're about 4.5% higher than where we are.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nSo we were down a little bit.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nIn last year, headcount -- there's a little bit more turnover. Turnover has come down a lot. And it wasn't super high last year, but it was higher than it is now. And so turnover's come down, and we were a little bit low -- below where we wanted to be last year at some points of the year. And where we are now is, besides the new hiring, everything is fully staffed; in fact, overstaffed in a few areas.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Silber (Analysts)】\nSorry, just a quick follow-up on the sales force question. Assuming normal turnover with sales force will probably stay relatively stable for the rest of the year, is that correct?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nWell, I think what we're saying is it would be up. It will stay fairly stable from now, from where we are now. Yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Silber (Analysts)】\nThat's my question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Silber (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then just on the seasonality side, Efrain, I know you called out a few things last quarter regarding growth rates in the HRS revenue and your operating margins for each quarter. Any changes to that or anything else we need to be aware of on a seasonal basis?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nNot particularly. We'll call out in next quarter's call if we see any things that are different from guidance, but no. I think the other thing, Jeff, I'd say is that if you look at the presentation that we posted -- should have posted it just recently, we have the supplemental guidance schedule at the end there. We're still within those ranges. So if you look at that closely, that's a pretty good guide for where we expect to be.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Keane (Analysts)】\nJust a couple of clarifications. What percentage of the new sales is going towards that SaaS-based solution versus more of a full-service model in core payroll?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. We don't break that out. We don't break that out, Bryan, specifically, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to do so. And the reason for that is that not only do we have SurePayroll, but we also have our own online product, which Marty talked about earlier. If you combine both of those, you're probably up over 1/4, maybe even 30% or so of sales in those models. That's about as definitive as we can get.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Keane (Analysts)】\nOkay. And the record sales you guys have seen, does that get us to potentially outside kind of the guided range? Are we trending above the range of kind of where we guided to for core and HR? I'm just trying to get a sense how does it translate into revenue if sales numbers seem to be doing -- kind of tracking ahead of plan.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. No, I don't think we're ready to start changing the guidance ranges. I would say we feel pretty comfortable that we're well within those guidance ranges. And billed revenue builds over the course of the year. And while we feel real good about Q1, we still have 3 quarters to go. We'll get a better picture as we get through the selling season, get some early signs.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Keane (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just last question for me. It looked like finally we turned the corner on interest on client funds. But just expectations, we always get the question on rates and rate increases, just maybe give us an update on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nSo our assumption is not much is going to change in this fiscal. So this fiscal goes to May. We think the real action then starts to occur in 2016. The Fed has really given a lot of very inconsistent signals. It looks like they want to raise sooner rather than later. But our planning assumption is really it's going to be a 2016 event, not a 2015 event. If they do it, obviously, we'll be happy with it but it's probably a next-year event.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Keane (Analysts)】\nAnd then just remind us, the raise of 25 basis points or just the impact of the model, just so we can get ready for it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nIt's about $4 million -- between $4 million and $5 million, that's the Cliffs Notes version. It's a little bit more complicated than that. But that's our disclosure in the Q. So yes, so we -- it starts to add up in a hurry if we get what we hope, which is a rise in short-term interest rates and the long part of the yield curve also goes up.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Macdonald (Analysts)】\nI just want to clarify a comment. Marty, I think you said something about moving down market with your sales force, maybe you could explain that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nNo. I made -- yes, one of the things is that we found that in selling -- our approach in the past has been a lot in the -- in what we call core payroll sell side. It's been very much to sell-in payroll. And then the other sales teams would kind of reach in over time at different stages to say, \"Hey, are you ready now for 401(k) or workers' comp or health insurance and so forth?\" And well, we've made some changes this year in saying that if you're a certain size, that we're coming in now with a combined sales force. So I guess, what I'm saying is we've kind of moved down in offering the full breadth of our services right up front in the way we approach a client. And I think we've gotten some nice traction and good stories on it already. By approaching a client with multiple sales teams together at once, if there are, let's say, 20 employees, you might go in with HR outsourcing, 401(k) and payroll all at the same time. In the past, our model was much more, \"Hey, I'll sell you payroll. And then the other teams will come in after you've had a month or 2 on the service and see if you need something else.\" So we're finding that, that kind of the need for those services, I'm sure you've seen this, has kind of pushed down over time and with the technology and the number of products available. And we think that this is a better way to capitalize on some of that is making sure the full need of the client is addressed right upfront as opposed to our traditional model, which was hitting them -- or selling them payroll right upfront.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nAnd I would say one other thing, Jim, is that our sales force execution capability is really, really superb. And that's helped us to understand the potential of this integrated selling approach, and it's paying dividends. Yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Macdonald (Analysts)】\nAnd maybe just another update on how you're doing in the middle market, since I don't think we've talked about that much yet.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. I think there, we've offered an awful lot of products. So we're combining all that product. We're -- I think you'll see shortly we're going to kind of brand that whole thing together because we've been adding a lot of product, as Efrain said -- mentioned, myStaffingPro, ExpenseWire, our own Paychex's next-generation offerings, our time and attendance now with both our legacy product and nettime. And we're in the process of being sure -- now, we've already been selling it that way, but we're kind of bundling it all together. And we'll be announcing that shortly to kind of put a tag all the way around that, along with we've been changing some of the service model there to be sure that when you have multi-products from us, that it's handled as smoothly as possible from a multi-product standpoint. So mid-market is -- we'd always like it to be stronger, but it's doing well against the competition that's out there and -- because I think we have a full breadth of product, as well as a great sales team there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy McHugh (Analysts)】\nJust following up on that last one, I guess. Are you seeing faster growth in the middle market or amongst your smaller customer base at this point, just relative to each other?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nRelative, I'd say, on the small -- under 50 is stronger. I think that's the marketplace. I think that's the economy. What we're seeing is small business starting to pick up finally. Still not where it was, but that's starting to pick up. And that we're offering that approach of -- we've already been offering the larger clients, the 50 plus, the multitude of products upfront. This approach of selling the breadth of our services below 50 on the front end is our newer approach. And so I think that's -- we're picking up there a little bit faster because of that approach. Also, the referral channels that I talked about, the banking, the franchise and, of course, our continuing in the CPA referral model, it's always been strong for us, that's where you see the smaller business growth come from because these are start-ups or companies that have reached the size that are under 50, but that they need a payroll solution. So I'd definitely say that the under 50 is seeing a little bit stronger growth right now. I think that's more because of those things than anything.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy McHugh (Analysts)】\nAnd the change in the PEO business in terms of the self-insured plans, is that -- I get the accounting impact that you described to us. But I guess, is it driving a significant improvement or acceleration in the growth rate of that business as well? I mean, is it also helping in the unit adds in a big way because it's more attractive to people?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, it's still fairly new to us. But I -- definitely, we did it as much -- because from a competitive standpoint, we felt that it was worth taking on a little bit more of the risk and so forth because we had even a more competitive product. We still have a number of carriers. But this plan, particularly in Florida where it's a very competitive PEO market, I think put us in a great spot. We'll find out a lot more in the next quarter or so, as we get into the true selling season of benefits and so forth. But we feel very good that that's positioned us even more competitively now in the PEO.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nAnd we also -- I'd just add to what Marty said. I mean, we really have a terrific PEO team and group that manages that business. So it -- I think our execution capability, our product capability have never been better.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy McHugh (Analysts)】\nCan you -- would you -- in terms of the comprehensive, I know you report comprehensive HR outsourcing kind of worksite employees. Give us a rough sense how much of that is PEO at this point. How big is that business now for you guys?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. It's still relatively -- I should say on the gross-up -- I was going to say it was relatively small. It's still not the bulk of HRS but it's growing in importance.  Tim, the reason why I gave you a somewhat imprecise answer there is that unlike other competitors, we manage our ASO and PEO and this other smaller product we call HR Essentials, which is a lighter version of our outsourcing product together in one sales force. And we're somewhat still agnostic in terms of whether a salesperson sells a PEO or ASO. We're going to -- it's going to depend on what client needs are. HRO, HR outsourcing, is the biggest part of HR Services, and that's where we're seeing the growth in that segment of the business. PEO, ASO, for us, they're largely interchangeable, both from a financial metrics standpoint, excluding the gross-up because that has a little bit of an impact on margins. But in terms of the offering we go to market, we're willing to sell either depending on what the client wants.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. I think the point there that Efrain is saying, when you look at all the products combined, that outsourcing of the HR function is a significant part of our -- of the HRS business. And I think as we said in the fourth quarter, we don't give the numbers all that -- probably once a year. But we service more client employees than any competitor combined, and I think for the most part, probably any 2 competitors combined. When you combine PEO, ASO and what Efrain -- HRE, kind of an essential offering, we're the largest HR outsourcer in that product set. So we're very proud of that, and that growth is going very well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Grossman (Analysts)】\nI'm wondering if we could just go back to an earlier question because I -- maybe I just misunderstood. But when we look at the growth year-over-year of 17% in that HRS line, to get an apples-to-apples number, should we be backing out $16 million of this-year revenue? Because that's...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. Yes, about that, $16 million. Yes, that's correct.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Grossman (Analysts)】\nSo it looks like then the growth rate was about 10% year-over-year. Does that sound right to you?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nNot too far off.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Grossman (Analysts)】\nRight. And is that -- I don't know if I've got good comps for the year, for the fiscal '15 year. So is that a deceleration from what we saw last year or last year's numbers...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nIt's comparable to Q4 of last year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Grossman (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then -- but the guidance for the year is -- how do we normalize that guidance for the...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, yes. So I think we went through that, David. So we have a 16% to 19% guidance range, and we said about 5% of it is the PEO -- 16% to 19% HRS to be precise, and minus 5%. So you pick the number you feel makes most sense. So I think the gist to your question, not reading in too much, is that we expect HRS to accelerate as the year goes on.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Grossman (Analysts)】\nRight. And what is the basis for that based on? Because you guys generally have a pretty good visibility in your business. So...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. We think -- I think there's probably 3 things on that. One is we expect insurance services to accelerate as we go through the year. That's a function of a number of things, not the least of which is being fully staffed and anniversary-ing some compares in that business that were tough last year. That's one. And then I think, as Marty said, we've talked a lot on this call, just the growth and the momentum in HR outsourcing services, we think, continues to build through the quarters and through the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Grossman (Analysts)】\nRight. And just on that last point, is there anything we should be thinking about in the context of what's going on either with the Affordable Care Act or the regulatory environment at large that would make us more optimistic or less optimistic over the next 12 to 18 months?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. I'll let Marty talk to kind of compliance-related products, which is its own sort of set of discussion. But I do want to clarify that our guidance doesn't assume that there's some material change in what we're seeing in terms of uptake of some of the compliance-related products, which Marty can talk to in a second. We just started looking at, based on the rate and on our plan, where we expect to be as the year progresses.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. I think in general, David, it's not getting any less regulated. Everything is getting more complex. And so one, regulations aren't going to get easier. And so -- and health care reform just continues to drive a lot of confusion at all levels as to when it's kicking in, what does it mean for them. And I think it's probably still pretty fluid from the way things have been. Second, the technology has gotten a lot better. The innovation has gotten a lot better, in our -- in, for example, our products and in other products -- other competitors' products that drive the ability to use HR services online at a lower level of client size -- employee size. And so a lot of that has come down because the technology and the products have gotten better. And I think that that's still -- that bodes well for us. We talk about time and attendance and we talk about HR administration online products that we have. These used to be 50 plus solidly, 50 to 100 plus. They've come down. Many clients are using them now. And the mobility offerings make it a lot easier as well. We find that the mobility offerings are being used by clients for everything from their employee contact list to reviewing an employee's 401(k) with them right -- face to face, just looking at their mobile app. So all that bodes well, I think, for demand for HR online, payroll online and a lot of the other -- and we didn't even really touch on 401(k), but 401(k) continues to be very strong as well. And I think the market leaves it always a little shaky on 401(k), whether to jump in or, but we're certainly seeing assets increase. And our initiative on large market, larger plans has started to pick up and pay some dividends as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. And just to build on Marty -- just focused almost exclusively on HR outsourcing, but we also expect that our retirement services revenue is going to build through the year too.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Grossman (Analysts)】\nRight. And just one last thing, again, based on a comment you made earlier. If the quarter came in perhaps a little bit stronger than you had anticipated, and again, that you typically have pretty good visibility on your business going into a year, let alone a quarter, can you help us better understand what the components were that maybe kind of drove a slightly better result than you had anticipated?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. That would -- David, I think I'd just leave it that -- to say we thought we had a strong quarter. We were pleased with it. If -- we were happy with what we saw on the payroll services side, and HRS continued to perform strongly. I'm cautious about getting too granular about projecting Q1 trends for the remainder of the year, because as I said earlier, we try to give annual guidance and stick with that so we don't get into a quarter-over-quarter conversation. And the only thing I'd caveat is, is the selling season is important to us. And it's good to start well. It's much, much better to finish well. And so we will continue to work on doing that, so we can continue to deliver good results.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy Willi (Analysts)】\nWanted to -- you just touched on it, but my question was about the 401(k) and retirement services business on 2 fronts. First was I remember, I guess, it's probably within the last couple of years, there was some shift towards different kind of plans that I think was sort of hurting the revenue growth relative to asset or account growth in that business. I'm just sort of curious if we have sort of cycled through that and there's not any kind of revenue issue relative to account growth or asset values that would have been a headwind like you transitioned through. And the second one...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI think [indiscernible] -- I'm sorry, go ahead.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy Willi (Analysts)】\nNo. And then the second part of the question, if I could, was just, again, you talked about the confidence you have in that business. Just anything specific to sales or product or if there are different referral channels that may be more productive around 401(k) and retirement services that you're focused on or have sort of figured out some opportunities around the sales management referral channels to help that business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI'll let Marty take the second part. So the first part, Tim, I think you may be referring to the fact that about 2 years ago or so, we decided to take a portion of the retirement services sales force and dedicate them to the upmarket. When we did that, we took people who were servicing the smaller market out and didn't necessarily replace those. So we had a little bit of a transition in that business as we did that, as the larger market reps were starting to ramp up. So we've anniversary-ed that. We think that the larger market reps are doing a really good job in execution. It's helped our growth rates in retirement services and feel that we've got a nice runway in front of us. You can see that in part by the amount of the growth in assets. That hasn't been just market growth but it's also been plan growth, meaning more plans and larger plans. So I think we're past that anniversary. I'll let Marty talk to the second...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. And I think Efrain pretty much covered it. I think the other thing we were doing was having a team that builds a lot more -- focuses on relationships with the financial advisers. And I think that that's really starting to pay some dividends there. We're -- it takes time to kind of build that relationship, so that they trust us going in to not only a brand-new client, but to go with a larger client and a conversion of a larger asset base. And we're really starting to pick up, I think, some momentum there and some trust from financial advisers to not just give us the start-ups, but the larger clients as well. And I think to us, that gives us confidence that we're going to see the year either as we predicted or a little bit stronger.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nWith regards -- just staying on the 401(k) for a second. So what sort of level of growth should we anticipate, roughly speaking, on retirement services?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nWe don't -- Mark, obviously, we don't break that out. It doesn't grow quite as quickly as HRS overall, but it's a little bit less than that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nJust a little bit less than what? The organic underlying growth rate?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nHRS overall. Yes, organic underlying growth. Thanks for the clarification.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nAnd then with regards to the health care offering on the PEO side, how should we think about the profitability of that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nThe profitability of the...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nThe minimum premium plan health care option.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. That's an interesting discussion that's probably worth a long, long time. But for purposes of the financial statement, it's a pass-through. It's actually a little bit more complex than that, simply because you do -- you can make some money on the plan. But what ends up happening is that, that just helps you to be that much more competitive in the future and buy down future rates. But from the standpoint of financial -- or financial results, it's largely a pass-through. Whatever your expenses are, you are not permitted to take a margin on those expenses.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nSo it sounds like the reality of what we should think about, from an economic perspective, would basically be that 11% to 14% growth on an underlying basis is really where we should focus?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nThat's right. That's right. Yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then with regards to the core, really glad to hear about how things are shaping up. Can you talk a little bit about some of the sales force metrics with regards to both the turnover rate, as well as the percentage of salespeople that are currently running at your historical quota rates?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. They are -- one, for turnover, it's a little bit below where we've been historically. Kind of historical average is in that 30% to 35% turnover rate. We're at the low end of that range right now. Now that can always change. But for first quarter, it's been very good. The recruiting, I think, of the new reps has been very good. So I think we're picking up a very good quality of new reps. And the training consistently has been revamped and so forth. I think it's very good execution of the leadership team across the board, from the senior team right to the district sales managers, just feel like a good experience level now in that team and that they've done very well. So I mean, when you look at the metrics, and I think I've said this, the units, what they're selling, the number of units is good as well as holding price. So that to us bodes well from an experience level and execution of the reps. So they're not just going in selling price and we're getting more units at a low price. We're getting unit growth and revenue-per-unit growth. So again, first quarter, but we're feeling positive about the execution of that sales team from those kind of metrics.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nGreat. And is there a sizable percentage that are now approaching our old historical prerecession quota rates?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI don't know if I'll go that far. It's -- I would say that from an annualized revenue perspective, they're certainly showing some promise. But I don't think -- again, the economy isn't where it was prerecession. But I'd say relative to the last few years and last year when we started to see really the best in 7 years, we're still at that level. So it's definitely the best we've seen since the recession and it continues to go up. I wouldn't say it's right at that prerecession levels yet though.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then one last one. Marty, with regards to the commentary in terms of the competitive takeaways, I missed that in terms of who that's coming from. Can you...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nNo, because I don't think I said. But I -- so didn't list the exact names there. But it certainly is the national player and -- as well as the regionals, more regional players. I think what you're seeing is national player, I think what we're doing very well is selling the value of our service combined with the technology, and that means that they can be online or they can be a SaaS offering that's online with mobile or full service. I think from the regional players what you're seeing is, particularly smaller players in the market, they're struggling more with the technology. They don't have the mobility offerings. They don't have the online offerings. These are changing constantly. We're updating our mobile offerings probably every quarter with something new. And these -- the smaller players just can't -- you just can't keep up with that technology now. And we're finding that clients are really using it. At the beginning, it was sporadic use. It's a lot of use now. Not so much doing their payroll, but for reports, for information or working with their employees on issues, they're using the mobility a lot. So...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Ellis (Analysts)】\nYes. I had a question on the PEO business, clearly healthy growth there. Can you characterize what, if any, risks you take on as you grow this business, and sort of what the mitigation approaches are around that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. So Lisa, there's 2 risks that everyone takes on who is in the PEO business: It's the quality of the workers' comp underwriting; and then secondarily, although we have talked a lot about minimum premium plans, we still have a lot of health insurance plans that are not under this cost-sharing arrangement. In the cost-sharing arrangements, and I should say the risk-sharing arrangements, if your health care book is not what you expected it to be, you can end up with having more health care costs than you gauged, and same thing with workers' comp. We use a number of sets of actuaries. I'm pretty familiar with the underwriting process in both areas. And we set the probabilities that we will exceed our targets at a very, very low rate. Meaning, when we ask our actuaries to do projections of what we think the costs are, we are not asking them to do a 95% probability. Typically, we're asking them to set it at 99-plus percent. So on the workers' comp side, we have done that over a number of years and have very, very good results managing books, our books of business on the workers' comp side. And we feel pretty comfortable. We have very deep expertise on the health care side, understanding and assessing risks; and in the last year, really built up our underwriting capability and our management capability in the PEO. So feel pretty comfortable. Wouldn't go down this route if we didn't.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Ellis (Analysts)】\nYes. And has that been sort of the rate-limiting factor on growth in the business, given we're seeing healthy growth in the PEO businesses kind of across the industry, and the economics, coming in new to this space, right, the economics to you and the economics to the client appear to be pretty compelling? So I'm just trying to understand like really nice healthy growth, but why isn't that faster? Does it end up being the underwriting components of it that kind of rate limits that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nNo. I think it's one element of it. But Marty faces the decision around how to make trade-offs with investments in -- across a number of different sales forces that are growing. And so I would say 2 or 3 years ago, people who followed us closely knew we struggled a little bit in the PEO, took a breather, retooled and have really gotten ourselves back in the game. So I think our level of investment in that sales force is commensurate with what we think the opportunity is right now. One other thing I would add to that is that it's not just PEO for us that's an important element of what we sell in HRO, but we have a very, very strong ASO business, which is very similar to PEO but doesn't have some of the risk characteristics that the PEO does. So we're looking at it a bit more holistically than other competitors do.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Ellis (Analysts)】\nTerrific. And real quick on the core payroll business. You mentioned that you're seeing continued growth in number of clients in core payroll. I know you don't disclose that on a quarterly basis, but can you kind of bound that? I know in this past fiscal year, it went up above 1% for the first time in several years. Are we sort of still running in that trajectory, stronger, weaker?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nSo we're -- we -- so last year, we finished at about 2%. We're certainly in that range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tien-Tsin Huang (Analysts)】\nJust quickly on the competitive takeaway question. I caught the national and the regional. But what about against point solution providers? You made it pretty clear that service is still in high demand. How about the competitive takeaway versus point solution providers?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nOkay, so define your definition, Tien-tsin, of...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tien-Tsin Huang (Analysts)】\nYes. So I'm thinking about point -- thinking about, let's call it payroll-only player or benefits-only provider, only 401(k) administrator. I'm just trying to think about unbundling all the different HRS solutions out there and see if maybe those are drifting in your direction. Does that make sense, Efrain?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, yes, that makes sense.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nAnd I think that, that is -- we tend to do very well. Again, I think the demand for the HR, kind of the overlapping services is pushed down in the market and so -- with the technology and the offerings and so forth. And so I think point -- the point service -- kind of the point providers, as you'd say, I think it's tougher for them to sell by themselves. And the better you can integrate that experience and make it easier for the client, they do -- more and more clients need multiple services, and they're not as interested in \"Hey, I'm going to take things from 3 different providers.\" So the key is okay now -- and you can see what we've acquired over the years, we brought in these great point solutions, and the key is to integrate them as seamlessly as possible from a service perspective for the client, so that you're adding a lot more value. They don't have the time or the desire anymore to integrate themselves, the clients, to integrate 3 different products, and -- I don't think. And so it's all a matter of integrating it in together. And that's what we've continued to do and will continue to work on.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nAnd, Tien-tsin, in the under-50 space particularly, it may be different in the enterprise space, what clients value about what -- one of the many things that clients value in that space is the ability to have one single point of access and access to your data. So single sign-on is really, really big. And then when that single sign-on is coupled with your ability to access all of the different aspects of the data that you're trying to manage, be it health and benefits, 401(k), HR outsourcing, that's really the compelling proposition. It may be different in the enterprise space. But in the -- certainly, in the under-50 space, they're looking for that integration, as Marty said.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tien-Tsin Huang (Analysts)】\nYes, that makes sense. Just my only follow-on is just I know there's a lot of questions on the 3%, the sales force increase. But given the single point of access, the salesperson is now required to be smart on a lot of different subjects, so does that change your comp structure or even your go-to-market and how you touch the client?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nNo, not really. I mean, I think we've had -- we're very competitive. First of all, from the comp structure, we always make changes to be sure we stay very competitive on that. But also, we're doing a lot of team selling. So the point I was trying to make earlier is that where we've come down now -- where that was always the approach, very much the approach that we had in the 50-plus, below-50 now and probably even in that 20-and-above range, there's a lot more team selling going on. So we have expertise. It's not necessarily expecting the rep to know everything. It's saying, hey, when you used to go in and sell payroll, and then your 401(k) sales team would come in a month later or 2 months later or 6 months later, now we go in together as a team on a lot of these leads and say, \"What's the full breadth of what the client needs,\" and look to sell them upfront. So it's not necessarily requiring a lot more from each individual salesperson, but more of a team approach to the way we're selling, which seems to be getting some traction now. I think the market's ready for it, and I think we're going to -- we will execute it well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nOkay. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived until October 24. Our Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held October 15 at 10 a.m. in Rochester, New York, and that meeting will also be broadcast over the Internet as well. I thank you for your -- taking the time to participate in our call and your interest in Paychex. Have a great day.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. We welcome you to our second quarter conference call. On the call with me are John Standley, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ken Martindale, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Darren Karst, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Vitrano, our Chief Administrative Officer. \r\nOn today's call, John will give an overview of our second quarter results and discuss our business, Ken will give an update on some of our key initiatives, Darren will discuss the financial highlights and fiscal 2015 outlook and then we will take questions. \r\nAs we mentioned in our release, we are providing slides related to the material we will be discussing today. These slides include annual earnings and sales guidance. These slides are provided on our website, www.riteaid.com, under the Investor Relations information tab for conference calls. This guidance is a point-in-time estimate and the company expressly disclaims any current intention to update it. \r\nThis conference call and the related slides will be available on the company's website until the next earnings call, unless the company withdraws them earlier, and should not be relied upon thereafter. We will not be referring to the slides directly in our remarks, but hope you will find them helpful as they summarize some of the key points made on the call. \r\nBefore we start, I'd like to remind you that today's conference call includes certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are made in the context of certain risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ. These risks and uncertainties are described in our press release, in Item 1A of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other documents we file or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission. \r\nAlso, we will be using a non-GAAP financial measure. The definition of the non-GAAP financial measure, along with the reconciliations to the related GAAP measure, are described in our press release. Also included in our slides are the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EBITDA gross profit and adjusted EBITDA SG&A and the reconciliations of these measures to their respective GAAP financial measure. \r\nWith these remarks, I'd now like to turn it over to John.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Matt, and thank you, all, for joining us to review our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. We are pleased with our results for the second quarter, which included our eighth consecutive quarter of profitability, growth in net income and adjusted EBITDA and significant increases in same-store sales and prescription count. \r\nOur total comparable store sales increased by 4.1% in the quarter, driven by a 3.7% increase in comparable scripts. Higher utilization in Medicaid expansion states drove this increase as well as the results of our pharmacy initiatives. The increased sales helped us drive net income of $127.8 million and adjusted EBITDA of $364.2 million, both of which were increases over the prior year second quarter. \r\nOur new Chief Financial Officer, Darren Karst, will provide additional details regarding our financial results for the quarter during his remarks. Darren is a proven leader with a track record of success throughout various financial disciplines, and we are very excited to have him as a member of our team. \r\nOne of the most significant initiatives we focused on during the second quarter was the continued implementation of our new drug purchasing and distribution process with McKesson, which provides our pharmacies with direct-to-store delivery 5 days a week. We have now completed the conversion of all stores and our 4 pharmacy distribution centers to this new distribution process. \r\nThe Rite Aid and McKesson teams did a great job of executing this conversion. We expect that this new process will provide the company with working capital benefits and improved customer service through better in-stock position. The agreement is also generating purchasing savings that are in line with our expectations. \r\nPharmacy gross profit improved due to higher revenues, the benefits of our purchasing agreement with McKesson and the impact on inventory valuation related to our transition to this new process. The net effect on inventory valuation resulting from this transition is not expected to be material for our fiscal 2015 results but did increase gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and pretax income by approximately $40 million in the second quarter. Pharmacy gross profit was negatively impacted by lower reimbursement rates. \r\nOur second quarter results certainly show that we've generated significant sales momentum in both front-end and pharmacy. While we believe that our key initiatives will continue to drive top line growth, we expect pharmacy gross margin in the second half of fiscal '15 to be lower than previous estimates based upon current estimates for reimbursement rates and anticipated lower profitability due to a delay in the introduction of a generic equivalent to Nexium and due to higher costs for generic drugs that recently lost their exclusivity. Therefore, we have lowered our guidance for adjusted EBITDA, net income and net income per diluted share. \r\nIn other developments, we made progress in our continued efforts to more aggressively pursue opportunities for long-term growth while transforming Rite Aid into a growing retail health care company. We continue to expand our pilot for Rite Aid Health Alliance, our innovative program that improves physicians -- that empowers physicians, in-store care coaches from Health Dialog and Rite Aid pharmacists to work together in providing a higher level of care to patients with one or more chronic conditions. \r\nEarly in the second quarter, we announced our largest Health Alliance partnership to date with Heritage Provider Network in Southern California. Most recently, we partnered with a sixth medical practice, Physician Direct ACO in Detroit. We also plan to begin opening RediClinics in select Rite Aid stores during the back half of the fiscal year as we look to deliver yet another convenient layer of health care support to the communities we serve. And as we continue to expand our health care offering, we're also making progress in building up our real estate pipeline to execute our relocation and new store program over the next several years. \r\nAt this time, I'd like to turn it over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Ken Martindale, who has additional information regarding our key initiatives. Ken?\n\n---\n\nThanks, John, and thanks, everybody, for joining us in the call this morning. We continue to make excellent progress on our key initiatives as we build a unique and engaging brand centered around health and wellness while actively working with our customers to keep them well. Our Wellness Store program is perhaps the most visible component of our ongoing transformation, and these stores continue to deliver strong results in the second quarter, once again, outperforming the rest of the chain in terms of same-store front-end sales and script count. Our teams are doing an excellent job of completing additional wellness remodels while minimizing the impact this process has on the customer experience during construction. Thanks to their efforts, we now have a grand total of 1,433 Wellness Stores, which represents about 31% of our entire chain. \r\nWe remain highly focused on leveraging our Wellness Store program to launch innovative merchandising concepts that significantly enhance the shopping experience. A great example is our new OTC presentation. This unique research-based consumer solution was developed and tested in conjunction with several key suppliers during the past year. The new design makes shopping navigation much easier and incorporates consumer education and product cross-selling to deliver a much better customer experience. This concept has been very well received by shoppers and is now rolling out to most future Genuine Well-being stores. \r\nIn addition, Wellness Stores will continue to play a key strategic role in launching initiatives that expand our health care offering. Initiatives such as the Rite Aid Health Alliance and RediClinics are taking our overall health and wellness experience to a new level. \r\nAnother critical component to our health and wellness strategy is our highly successful wellness+ customer loyalty program. During the quarter, we continue to further develop our customer relationship marketing program, which is helping us to better understand the individual needs of our wellness+ members. Our increasing number of targeted campaigns, we've been able to drive incremental growth not only in terms of basket size, but also trip frequency. Our gold membership continues to increase, which is significant because these members represent our most valuable and loyal customers. \r\nThis month, we launched the promotion that gives all wellness+ members the opportunity to earn triple points on qualifying front-end purchases. Known as Member September, this promotion is designed to further engage our plus and bronze level members to incent them to advance to the silver or gold tiers, where they can experience the value of receiving a 10% or 20% discount the entire year. \r\nWe now have more than 2.1 million senior members enrolled in the wellness65+ program. A specific area of success has been our monthly wellness65+ Wednesday events, which allows 65+ members to receive a 20% discount on most items in the store for the entire day. While they're in the store, these members can also participate in our monthly wellness-focused events that are designed to help our senior customers experience all the benefits wellness+ has to offer. \r\nAnd finally, we've incorporated wellness+ into our new comprehensive Quit For You smoking cessation program. Launched in late August, this free program centers around the counseling skills of our nearly 11,000 Rite Aid pharmacists who have received special training to meet one-on-one with these patients who want to quit smoking. Our pharmacists actively work with these patients to develop a personalized quit plan based on a variety of effective smoking cessation methods. We are also providing free in-store and online educational resources as well as discounts and incentives to wellness+ to encourage them to follow through on their quit attempt. \r\nThe Quit For You program is an excellent example of how we continue to look for ways to make wellness+ even stronger while positioning our Rite Aid pharmacists to play a more active role in helping patients achieve their wellness goals. \r\nOur flu immunization program is now in full swing as our teams engage with customers about getting their annual flu shot from a Rite Aid pharmacist. Once again, we're supporting these efforts with a comprehensive marketing campaign, which includes radio spots as well as television commercials airing on national networks through November. Our chain-wide goal for the year is to administer 3 million flu shots. We're also using the annual flu shot campaign as an opportunity to educate our customers about the additional vaccines we offer on a state-by-state basis to strengthen Rite Aid's position as an immunization destination. \r\nCustomers continue to respond positively to our offering of Rite Aid brand products. During the quarter, private brand penetration increased more than 30 basis points over the prior year to 18.3%, and we remain highly focused on further developing our offering to create a world-class private brand. \r\nOur prescription file buy initiative continues to gain momentum as we completed $20.4 million in file buys during the second quarter. We expect to achieve our goal of $90 million for the fiscal year. And as we more aggressively pursue opportunities for growth, we're prepared to increase our allocation for file buys if additional opportunities arise. To sum it up, we are pleased with the significant progress of our key initiatives as we focus on growing our business while delivering the ultimate health and wellness experience for our customers. \r\nWe're also very excited about the recent enhancements we've made to our KidCents program, which is administered through the Rite Aid Foundation. KidCents allows customers to round up their purchases to the nearest dollar and donate the change to support charities focused on the health and well-being of children. We launched KidCents about a year ago and the program has been very well received. Just this week, we announced that we're taking this charitable giving program to the next level by letting customers choose the charity that they want to support by directing their donation to one of our 204 KidCents charities. \r\nTo celebrate the occasion, Rite Aid associates across the country are presenting $10,000 checks to each of these 204 inaugural charities totaling over $2 million in donations. One of our core values is being a caring neighbor in the communities that we serve, and we are proud of the positive impact we're making in support of children's health and wellness through KidCents. \r\nAt this time, I'll turn it over to Darren, who will provide additional details about our financial results. Darren?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results reflect strong script count and front-end trends, good cost control and continued progress on our business initiatives. Gross margin was slightly improved from last year's second quarter due to a lower LIFO charge and cost reductions from our purchasing arrangement with McKesson, but that was partially offset by continuing reimbursement rate pressure. On the call this morning, I will walk through our second quarter financial results; discuss our liquidity, certain balance sheet items, our capital expenditure program; and finally, review our revised 2015 annual guidance. \r\nRevenue for the quarter was $6.5 billion, which was $244 million or 3.9% higher than last year's second quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher pharmacy sales. Overall, same-store sales increased 4.1% in the quarter, reflecting a higher pharmacy script count and inflation rate. Front-end same-store sales increased by 1.1%. Pharmacy same-store sales were higher by 5.6%, which included an approximate 200 basis point negative impact from new generic drugs compared to 250 basis points in the prior year's second quarter. Pharmacy same-store script count was up 3.7%, reflecting higher utilization, particularly in Medicaid expansion states. \r\nAdjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $364.2 million or 5.6% of revenues, which was $22.6 million higher than last year's second quarter of $341.6 million or 5.4% of revenues. The current quarter's results were primarily driven by improved sales, which drove an increase in gross profit, offset in part by higher SG&A, which was also the result of higher sales. \r\nNet income for the quarter was $127.8 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to last year's second quarter net income of $32.8 million or $0.03 per diluted share. The increase was driven by the $22.6 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA, a lower LIFO provision and a $62 million loss on debt retirement in the prior year, all partially offset by higher income tax expense. \r\nIncome tax expense includes certain state income taxes and a provision to maintain a full tax valuation allowance for the company's deferred tax assets. The increase year-over-year was related to the adjustment to maintain the full tax valuation allowance, which was driven by higher stock compensation expense for tax purposes. The valuation allowance increase is a noncash item. The lower LIFO charge was primarily the result of a partial LIFO liquidation, resulting from the decrease in pharmacy inventory levels, which reduced the effect that inflation otherwise had on our LIFO charge. \r\nTotal gross profit dollars in the quarter were $78.2 million better than last year's second quarter and 12 basis points higher as a percent of revenues. Adjusted EBITDA gross profit, which excludes specific items, was favorable to the prior year second quarter by $55.2 million, but lower by 25 basis points as a percent of revenues. Pharmacy gross profit dollars were higher, but margin rate was lower. Pharmacy gross profit was positively impacted by our increased prescription count and negatively impacted by continued reimbursement rate pressure, which we were able to partially offset through purchasing efficiencies. Gross profit was also favorably impacted by the effect on our inventory valuation related to the transition to our new drug purchasing and delivery arrangement with McKesson. The net effect on inventory valuation resulting from this transition to McKesson is not expected to be material to our full year fiscal 2015 results, but it did increase our gross profit by approximately $40 million in the second quarter. We expect to see continued margin pressure from reimbursement rate reductions throughout the remainder of the year. Front-end gross profit dollars and margin rate were favorable to last year. \r\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were higher by $37.6 million but 38 basis points lower as a percent of revenues compared to last year. Adjusted EBITDA SG&A dollars, which excludes specific items, were higher by $32.6 million but 40 basis points lower as a percent of revenues compared to last year, as we were able to leverage the increase in sales through our various expense control initiatives. The increase in dollars was in part related to the incremental $19 million in operating costs related to the recent acquisitions of Health Dialog and RediClinic, with payroll costs related to our higher sales volume driving the balance of the dollar increase. \r\nFIFO inventory was lower than the second quarter of last year by approximately $220 million, driven by a reduction in pharmacy inventory, resulting from our transition to direct-store delivery from McKesson. \r\nOur cash flow statement for the quarter shows a net source of cash from operating activities of $123 million as compared to a source of $80 million in last year's second quarter, with working capital timing differences and higher adjusted EBITDA driving the variance. \r\nNet cash used in investing activities for the quarter was $120 million versus $111 million last year. During the second quarter, we remodeled 117 stores, expanded 1 store, opened 1 store, relocated 5 stores and closed 10 stores. At the end of the second quarter, we've completed and grand reopened 1,433 Wellness Stores. For the second quarter, front-end sales -- front-end same-store sales in our Wellness Stores were approximately 250 basis points higher than our non-Wellness Stores, and script growth was 85 basis points higher. \r\nNow let's discuss liquidity. At the end of the second quarter, we had $1.37 billion of liquidity, and that includes $1.32 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility and $50 million of invested cash. Our liquidity has increased by $340 million year-over-year. We had $405 million of borrowings outstanding under our $1.8 billion revolving credit facility and had $72 million of outstanding letters of credit. Total debt net of invested cash was lower by $348 million from last year's second quarter. Our leverage ratio, defined as total debt less invested cash over LTM adjusted EBITDA, improved to 4.4x from 4.6x as compared to last year's second quarter. \r\nNow let's turn to our current year guidance. Our guidance reflects greater reimbursement rate pressure than we had previously anticipated. In addition, it reflects a delay in the introduction of the generic equivalent of Nexium and lower profitability due to manufacturing delays on new generic drugs that recently lost exclusivity. It also reflects our expected benefits from the McKesson purchasing agreement in the second half of the year. Our guidance continues to include anticipated benefits of our wellness remodel program, customer loyalty program and other initiatives to grow sales and drive operational efficiencies. We expect the current competitive environment to remain promotional. \r\nWe continue to expect a working capital benefit of approximately $250 million as a result of the McKesson agreement. We also continue to expect script growth to benefit from the Affordable Care Act, favorable demographics, file buy acquisitions, growth in immunizations and other initiatives. \r\nTotal sales are expected to be between $26 billion and $26.3 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.2 billion and $1.275 billion for fiscal 2015. \r\nSame-store sales are expected to be in a range from an increase of 3% to 4%, including the anticipated negative pharmacy sales impact of approximately 220 basis points from new generic introductions and continued reimbursement rate pressure. We expect a range of net income of $223 million to $333 million and earnings per diluted share to be in a range of $0.22 to $0.33. The range of guidance is primarily driven by our same-store sales range and pharmacy margin expectations. \r\nOur fiscal 2015 capital expenditure plan is to spend $525 million, with $225 million related to remodels and $90 million for file buys. We're planning to open 2 new stores, acquire 7 stores, complete 16 relocations and remodel 450 Wellness Stores in fiscal 2015. \r\nWe expect free cash flow to be in a range of $325 million to $375 million for the year, including the benefit of lower pharmacy inventory and the acquisition of RediClinic and Health Dialog. We expect to close a total of 40 stores, of which the guidance includes a lease -- a store lease closing provision for 15 stores, with the balance of those stores closing upon lease expiration. \r\nThe guidance also reflects the call and prepayment of our 10.25% second lien notes due in 2019 when the call premium steps down in October. We will fund this prepayment with borrowings under our revolving credit facility. \r\nThis completes my portion of the presentation. And now I'd like to turn it back to John. John?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Darren. Before we open the phone lines for questions, I would like to thank our Rite Aid associates for a great quarter and the tremendous work they're doing to execute our key initiatives and deliver a great experience to our customers. Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to expand our health care offering and position Rite Aid as a convenient destination for affordable and effective health care solutions. We believe that this approach will help us better meet the needs of the communities we serve while capitalizing on key opportunities to grow our business. \r\nThat concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. I'm sure there aren't any questions. But just in case, we'll open the phone lines and see. Operator?",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Matt Schroeder (Executives)】\nThank you, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. We welcome you to our second quarter conference call. On the call with me are John Standley, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ken Martindale, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Darren Karst, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Vitrano, our Chief Administrative Officer. \r\nOn today's call, John will give an overview of our second quarter results and discuss our business, Ken will give an update on some of our key initiatives, Darren will discuss the financial highlights and fiscal 2015 outlook and then we will take questions. \r\nAs we mentioned in our release, we are providing slides related to the material we will be discussing today. These slides include annual earnings and sales guidance. These slides are provided on our website, www.riteaid.com, under the Investor Relations information tab for conference calls. This guidance is a point-in-time estimate and the company expressly disclaims any current intention to update it. \r\nThis conference call and the related slides will be available on the company's website until the next earnings call, unless the company withdraws them earlier, and should not be relied upon thereafter. We will not be referring to the slides directly in our remarks, but hope you will find them helpful as they summarize some of the key points made on the call. \r\nBefore we start, I'd like to remind you that today's conference call includes certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are made in the context of certain risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ. These risks and uncertainties are described in our press release, in Item 1A of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other documents we file or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission. \r\nAlso, we will be using a non-GAAP financial measure. The definition of the non-GAAP financial measure, along with the reconciliations to the related GAAP measure, are described in our press release. Also included in our slides are the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EBITDA gross profit and adjusted EBITDA SG&A and the reconciliations of these measures to their respective GAAP financial measure. \r\nWith these remarks, I'd now like to turn it over to John.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: John Standley (Executives)】\nThanks, Matt, and thank you, all, for joining us to review our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. We are pleased with our results for the second quarter, which included our eighth consecutive quarter of profitability, growth in net income and adjusted EBITDA and significant increases in same-store sales and prescription count. \r\nOur total comparable store sales increased by 4.1% in the quarter, driven by a 3.7% increase in comparable scripts. Higher utilization in Medicaid expansion states drove this increase as well as the results of our pharmacy initiatives. The increased sales helped us drive net income of $127.8 million and adjusted EBITDA of $364.2 million, both of which were increases over the prior year second quarter. \r\nOur new Chief Financial Officer, Darren Karst, will provide additional details regarding our financial results for the quarter during his remarks. Darren is a proven leader with a track record of success throughout various financial disciplines, and we are very excited to have him as a member of our team. \r\nOne of the most significant initiatives we focused on during the second quarter was the continued implementation of our new drug purchasing and distribution process with McKesson, which provides our pharmacies with direct-to-store delivery 5 days a week. We have now completed the conversion of all stores and our 4 pharmacy distribution centers to this new distribution process. \r\nThe Rite Aid and McKesson teams did a great job of executing this conversion. We expect that this new process will provide the company with working capital benefits and improved customer service through better in-stock position. The agreement is also generating purchasing savings that are in line with our expectations. \r\nPharmacy gross profit improved due to higher revenues, the benefits of our purchasing agreement with McKesson and the impact on inventory valuation related to our transition to this new process. The net effect on inventory valuation resulting from this transition is not expected to be material for our fiscal 2015 results but did increase gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and pretax income by approximately $40 million in the second quarter. Pharmacy gross profit was negatively impacted by lower reimbursement rates. \r\nOur second quarter results certainly show that we've generated significant sales momentum in both front-end and pharmacy. While we believe that our key initiatives will continue to drive top line growth, we expect pharmacy gross margin in the second half of fiscal '15 to be lower than previous estimates based upon current estimates for reimbursement rates and anticipated lower profitability due to a delay in the introduction of a generic equivalent to Nexium and due to higher costs for generic drugs that recently lost their exclusivity. Therefore, we have lowered our guidance for adjusted EBITDA, net income and net income per diluted share. \r\nIn other developments, we made progress in our continued efforts to more aggressively pursue opportunities for long-term growth while transforming Rite Aid into a growing retail health care company. We continue to expand our pilot for Rite Aid Health Alliance, our innovative program that improves physicians -- that empowers physicians, in-store care coaches from Health Dialog and Rite Aid pharmacists to work together in providing a higher level of care to patients with one or more chronic conditions. \r\nEarly in the second quarter, we announced our largest Health Alliance partnership to date with Heritage Provider Network in Southern California. Most recently, we partnered with a sixth medical practice, Physician Direct ACO in Detroit. We also plan to begin opening RediClinics in select Rite Aid stores during the back half of the fiscal year as we look to deliver yet another convenient layer of health care support to the communities we serve. And as we continue to expand our health care offering, we're also making progress in building up our real estate pipeline to execute our relocation and new store program over the next several years. \r\nAt this time, I'd like to turn it over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Ken Martindale, who has additional information regarding our key initiatives. Ken?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nThanks, John, and thanks, everybody, for joining us in the call this morning. We continue to make excellent progress on our key initiatives as we build a unique and engaging brand centered around health and wellness while actively working with our customers to keep them well. Our Wellness Store program is perhaps the most visible component of our ongoing transformation, and these stores continue to deliver strong results in the second quarter, once again, outperforming the rest of the chain in terms of same-store front-end sales and script count. Our teams are doing an excellent job of completing additional wellness remodels while minimizing the impact this process has on the customer experience during construction. Thanks to their efforts, we now have a grand total of 1,433 Wellness Stores, which represents about 31% of our entire chain. \r\nWe remain highly focused on leveraging our Wellness Store program to launch innovative merchandising concepts that significantly enhance the shopping experience. A great example is our new OTC presentation. This unique research-based consumer solution was developed and tested in conjunction with several key suppliers during the past year. The new design makes shopping navigation much easier and incorporates consumer education and product cross-selling to deliver a much better customer experience. This concept has been very well received by shoppers and is now rolling out to most future Genuine Well-being stores. \r\nIn addition, Wellness Stores will continue to play a key strategic role in launching initiatives that expand our health care offering. Initiatives such as the Rite Aid Health Alliance and RediClinics are taking our overall health and wellness experience to a new level. \r\nAnother critical component to our health and wellness strategy is our highly successful wellness+ customer loyalty program. During the quarter, we continue to further develop our customer relationship marketing program, which is helping us to better understand the individual needs of our wellness+ members. Our increasing number of targeted campaigns, we've been able to drive incremental growth not only in terms of basket size, but also trip frequency. Our gold membership continues to increase, which is significant because these members represent our most valuable and loyal customers. \r\nThis month, we launched the promotion that gives all wellness+ members the opportunity to earn triple points on qualifying front-end purchases. Known as Member September, this promotion is designed to further engage our plus and bronze level members to incent them to advance to the silver or gold tiers, where they can experience the value of receiving a 10% or 20% discount the entire year. \r\nWe now have more than 2.1 million senior members enrolled in the wellness65+ program. A specific area of success has been our monthly wellness65+ Wednesday events, which allows 65+ members to receive a 20% discount on most items in the store for the entire day. While they're in the store, these members can also participate in our monthly wellness-focused events that are designed to help our senior customers experience all the benefits wellness+ has to offer. \r\nAnd finally, we've incorporated wellness+ into our new comprehensive Quit For You smoking cessation program. Launched in late August, this free program centers around the counseling skills of our nearly 11,000 Rite Aid pharmacists who have received special training to meet one-on-one with these patients who want to quit smoking. Our pharmacists actively work with these patients to develop a personalized quit plan based on a variety of effective smoking cessation methods. We are also providing free in-store and online educational resources as well as discounts and incentives to wellness+ to encourage them to follow through on their quit attempt. \r\nThe Quit For You program is an excellent example of how we continue to look for ways to make wellness+ even stronger while positioning our Rite Aid pharmacists to play a more active role in helping patients achieve their wellness goals. \r\nOur flu immunization program is now in full swing as our teams engage with customers about getting their annual flu shot from a Rite Aid pharmacist. Once again, we're supporting these efforts with a comprehensive marketing campaign, which includes radio spots as well as television commercials airing on national networks through November. Our chain-wide goal for the year is to administer 3 million flu shots. We're also using the annual flu shot campaign as an opportunity to educate our customers about the additional vaccines we offer on a state-by-state basis to strengthen Rite Aid's position as an immunization destination. \r\nCustomers continue to respond positively to our offering of Rite Aid brand products. During the quarter, private brand penetration increased more than 30 basis points over the prior year to 18.3%, and we remain highly focused on further developing our offering to create a world-class private brand. \r\nOur prescription file buy initiative continues to gain momentum as we completed $20.4 million in file buys during the second quarter. We expect to achieve our goal of $90 million for the fiscal year. And as we more aggressively pursue opportunities for growth, we're prepared to increase our allocation for file buys if additional opportunities arise. To sum it up, we are pleased with the significant progress of our key initiatives as we focus on growing our business while delivering the ultimate health and wellness experience for our customers. \r\nWe're also very excited about the recent enhancements we've made to our KidCents program, which is administered through the Rite Aid Foundation. KidCents allows customers to round up their purchases to the nearest dollar and donate the change to support charities focused on the health and well-being of children. We launched KidCents about a year ago and the program has been very well received. Just this week, we announced that we're taking this charitable giving program to the next level by letting customers choose the charity that they want to support by directing their donation to one of our 204 KidCents charities. \r\nTo celebrate the occasion, Rite Aid associates across the country are presenting $10,000 checks to each of these 204 inaugural charities totaling over $2 million in donations. One of our core values is being a caring neighbor in the communities that we serve, and we are proud of the positive impact we're making in support of children's health and wellness through KidCents. \r\nAt this time, I'll turn it over to Darren, who will provide additional details about our financial results. Darren?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Darren Karst (Executives)】\nThanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results reflect strong script count and front-end trends, good cost control and continued progress on our business initiatives. Gross margin was slightly improved from last year's second quarter due to a lower LIFO charge and cost reductions from our purchasing arrangement with McKesson, but that was partially offset by continuing reimbursement rate pressure. On the call this morning, I will walk through our second quarter financial results; discuss our liquidity, certain balance sheet items, our capital expenditure program; and finally, review our revised 2015 annual guidance. \r\nRevenue for the quarter was $6.5 billion, which was $244 million or 3.9% higher than last year's second quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher pharmacy sales. Overall, same-store sales increased 4.1% in the quarter, reflecting a higher pharmacy script count and inflation rate. Front-end same-store sales increased by 1.1%. Pharmacy same-store sales were higher by 5.6%, which included an approximate 200 basis point negative impact from new generic drugs compared to 250 basis points in the prior year's second quarter. Pharmacy same-store script count was up 3.7%, reflecting higher utilization, particularly in Medicaid expansion states. \r\nAdjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $364.2 million or 5.6% of revenues, which was $22.6 million higher than last year's second quarter of $341.6 million or 5.4% of revenues. The current quarter's results were primarily driven by improved sales, which drove an increase in gross profit, offset in part by higher SG&A, which was also the result of higher sales. \r\nNet income for the quarter was $127.8 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to last year's second quarter net income of $32.8 million or $0.03 per diluted share. The increase was driven by the $22.6 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA, a lower LIFO provision and a $62 million loss on debt retirement in the prior year, all partially offset by higher income tax expense. \r\nIncome tax expense includes certain state income taxes and a provision to maintain a full tax valuation allowance for the company's deferred tax assets. The increase year-over-year was related to the adjustment to maintain the full tax valuation allowance, which was driven by higher stock compensation expense for tax purposes. The valuation allowance increase is a noncash item. The lower LIFO charge was primarily the result of a partial LIFO liquidation, resulting from the decrease in pharmacy inventory levels, which reduced the effect that inflation otherwise had on our LIFO charge. \r\nTotal gross profit dollars in the quarter were $78.2 million better than last year's second quarter and 12 basis points higher as a percent of revenues. Adjusted EBITDA gross profit, which excludes specific items, was favorable to the prior year second quarter by $55.2 million, but lower by 25 basis points as a percent of revenues. Pharmacy gross profit dollars were higher, but margin rate was lower. Pharmacy gross profit was positively impacted by our increased prescription count and negatively impacted by continued reimbursement rate pressure, which we were able to partially offset through purchasing efficiencies. Gross profit was also favorably impacted by the effect on our inventory valuation related to the transition to our new drug purchasing and delivery arrangement with McKesson. The net effect on inventory valuation resulting from this transition to McKesson is not expected to be material to our full year fiscal 2015 results, but it did increase our gross profit by approximately $40 million in the second quarter. We expect to see continued margin pressure from reimbursement rate reductions throughout the remainder of the year. Front-end gross profit dollars and margin rate were favorable to last year. \r\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were higher by $37.6 million but 38 basis points lower as a percent of revenues compared to last year. Adjusted EBITDA SG&A dollars, which excludes specific items, were higher by $32.6 million but 40 basis points lower as a percent of revenues compared to last year, as we were able to leverage the increase in sales through our various expense control initiatives. The increase in dollars was in part related to the incremental $19 million in operating costs related to the recent acquisitions of Health Dialog and RediClinic, with payroll costs related to our higher sales volume driving the balance of the dollar increase. \r\nFIFO inventory was lower than the second quarter of last year by approximately $220 million, driven by a reduction in pharmacy inventory, resulting from our transition to direct-store delivery from McKesson. \r\nOur cash flow statement for the quarter shows a net source of cash from operating activities of $123 million as compared to a source of $80 million in last year's second quarter, with working capital timing differences and higher adjusted EBITDA driving the variance. \r\nNet cash used in investing activities for the quarter was $120 million versus $111 million last year. During the second quarter, we remodeled 117 stores, expanded 1 store, opened 1 store, relocated 5 stores and closed 10 stores. At the end of the second quarter, we've completed and grand reopened 1,433 Wellness Stores. For the second quarter, front-end sales -- front-end same-store sales in our Wellness Stores were approximately 250 basis points higher than our non-Wellness Stores, and script growth was 85 basis points higher. \r\nNow let's discuss liquidity. At the end of the second quarter, we had $1.37 billion of liquidity, and that includes $1.32 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility and $50 million of invested cash. Our liquidity has increased by $340 million year-over-year. We had $405 million of borrowings outstanding under our $1.8 billion revolving credit facility and had $72 million of outstanding letters of credit. Total debt net of invested cash was lower by $348 million from last year's second quarter. Our leverage ratio, defined as total debt less invested cash over LTM adjusted EBITDA, improved to 4.4x from 4.6x as compared to last year's second quarter. \r\nNow let's turn to our current year guidance. Our guidance reflects greater reimbursement rate pressure than we had previously anticipated. In addition, it reflects a delay in the introduction of the generic equivalent of Nexium and lower profitability due to manufacturing delays on new generic drugs that recently lost exclusivity. It also reflects our expected benefits from the McKesson purchasing agreement in the second half of the year. Our guidance continues to include anticipated benefits of our wellness remodel program, customer loyalty program and other initiatives to grow sales and drive operational efficiencies. We expect the current competitive environment to remain promotional. \r\nWe continue to expect a working capital benefit of approximately $250 million as a result of the McKesson agreement. We also continue to expect script growth to benefit from the Affordable Care Act, favorable demographics, file buy acquisitions, growth in immunizations and other initiatives. \r\nTotal sales are expected to be between $26 billion and $26.3 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.2 billion and $1.275 billion for fiscal 2015. \r\nSame-store sales are expected to be in a range from an increase of 3% to 4%, including the anticipated negative pharmacy sales impact of approximately 220 basis points from new generic introductions and continued reimbursement rate pressure. We expect a range of net income of $223 million to $333 million and earnings per diluted share to be in a range of $0.22 to $0.33. The range of guidance is primarily driven by our same-store sales range and pharmacy margin expectations. \r\nOur fiscal 2015 capital expenditure plan is to spend $525 million, with $225 million related to remodels and $90 million for file buys. We're planning to open 2 new stores, acquire 7 stores, complete 16 relocations and remodel 450 Wellness Stores in fiscal 2015. \r\nWe expect free cash flow to be in a range of $325 million to $375 million for the year, including the benefit of lower pharmacy inventory and the acquisition of RediClinic and Health Dialog. We expect to close a total of 40 stores, of which the guidance includes a lease -- a store lease closing provision for 15 stores, with the balance of those stores closing upon lease expiration. \r\nThe guidance also reflects the call and prepayment of our 10.25% second lien notes due in 2019 when the call premium steps down in October. We will fund this prepayment with borrowings under our revolving credit facility. \r\nThis completes my portion of the presentation. And now I'd like to turn it back to John. John?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: John Standley (Executives)】\nThank you, Darren. Before we open the phone lines for questions, I would like to thank our Rite Aid associates for a great quarter and the tremendous work they're doing to execute our key initiatives and deliver a great experience to our customers. Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to expand our health care offering and position Rite Aid as a convenient destination for affordable and effective health care solutions. We believe that this approach will help us better meet the needs of the communities we serve while capitalizing on key opportunities to grow our business. \r\nThat concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. I'm sure there aren't any questions. But just in case, we'll open the phone lines and see. Operator?",
      "transcript_text3": "So guys, a few things. You talked about the $40 million valuation -- inventory valuation item as being not material for the year. Is that because there is an offset in other quarters? Or because $40 million on the base of $1.2 billion is not material?\n\n---\n\nThere's offsets coming in the third and fourth quarter.\n\n---\n\nTotaling roughly $40 million or close to it?\n\n---\n\nYes, close to it.\n\n---\n\nAnd then those relate to what? The same valuation item or something else?\n\n---\n\nYes. So as we're making this transition, there is a -- inventory valuation is impacted from a number of different items. So they all relate to inventory valuation but relate to allowances and cost capitalization, all kinds of things, kind of moving through to the numbers as we make this transition.\n\n---\n\nAll right. And then secondly, is reimbursement -- when you think about it, it's not as -- it's worse than you thought it might be. Is that because -- I'm also thinking about generic inflation in here. Are those -- has those things gotten worse in the past 2, 3, 4 months? Or they haven't improved the way you thought they might in the back half?\n\n---\n\nSo we'll break that into 2 pieces. The first animal is really reimbursement rates, and I would say the reimbursement rate environment seems a little tougher in the back half than we expected. And I'm sure, as you know, John, the reimbursement rate view evolves all the time. We're -- have plans that are in negotiation and we have migrations inside the plans, and a number of different things going on all the time related to reimbursement rates. So that's a view we're constantly updating and sort of looking at. And based on what we can see at this time, the back half looks a little tougher than we initially expected or -- expected, even as of June, so that's kind of where we sit. On the generic inflation front, I mean, I think the good news is we're making some good progress in our purchasing arrangement with McKesson. And so I think on the margin side in terms of costs, we had a pretty darn good quarter here this quarter, and we're expecting to continue to make good progress there across the back half.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then lastly, when do you now think Nexium begins to positively impact you? Next fiscal year or...\n\n---\n\nYes, it's next fiscal year. I mean, it feels like in our fiscal year, there -- or [ph] probably be the first or second quarter based on what we know today.\n\n---\n\nThe reimbursement issue is something we've been talking about now for several quarters, and it sounds like it got even worse than what you guys thought it was just 3 months ago. I guess, just maybe to level-set everyone, how well of a handle do you feel like you have on this dynamic today? And then maybe just to help us out, it doesn't necessarily sound like generic inflation itself is the issue. It's really the rate at which your reimbursement rate catches up. I mean, how -- I guess how much exposure do you have to this today? And are there are tangible meaningful things you can do to kind of right this discrepancy in the way you're reimbursed?\n\n---\n\nYes. So in terms of our view and our handle on it, we do have good information for a piece of our business. All of our -- we have a number of fixed-rate contracts we have talked about in the past. But even inside of those plans, there are different levels of rates. And we have migration around inside of those plans, we have migration amongst payers as well as constant contract negotiations going on all the time. So there are a number of dynamics that we do have to estimate, so it is not a perfect science for sure. Having said that, it's also important to keep in mind that we dispense, at the AWP level, about $40 billion worth of drugs a year. So even a modest few basis points in reimbursement rate change in our view can have an impact on earnings, so that's just the way it is. And I think this year may be compared to last year or the year before or the year before that. One significant difference is we do not have as much profitability from new generics that we've had in the past, so whereas we may have seen some volatility in reimbursement rate, we also had a lot of profitability in the generics. And so maybe it just wasn't as visible maybe versus where we're at right this moment. A couple of things that are slipping here are in fact, slipping. We talked about Nexium already. We also had some newer generics that lost exclusivity that didn't come to market as profitably as we thought, honestly, in part because there just weren't as many manufacturers as we expected, but we can see FDA applications coming in on a number of those items. And so we think those are items that are really probably moving to next year. So we'll probably maybe catch up a little bit as those items bring us some profitability into next year. So I think that's all good news. But I think we're going continue to have to work through the reimbursement rate environment that we're in. We're going to have to be efficient. We're going to have to continue to work on the purchasing side as hard as we can and pick away at this thing.\n\n---\n\nThat's fair. And then I guess that kind of leads into my next question in thinking about how unique this year is versus next year. Back half typically better than the front half. Obviously, this year, a lot of different dynamics at play. Probably, that's not the case. But as we think about the back half as a jumping off point into next year, are you guys viewing, even preliminarily, that you'll be able to kind of return to EBITDA growth next year? And I only asked this because from a high level, this year, given the -- other than the reimbursement issues, you did have a positive script trend. The McKesson benefit should help you in the back half. Just trying to think about putting the back half in context of fiscal '16.\n\n---\n\nYes. It's certainly a fair question, and we're going to probably be careful not to give guidance, at this point, based on where we're at today. But we do have some very positive tailwinds to help us. We do have strong momentum on the top line. We are working on a number of initiatives, including the McKesson arrangement. Lots of exciting things going on at retail that Ken is really pushing through the business here. So we remain optimistic about next year. But probably, we're not in a position to give you guidance today.\n\n---\n\nSo just to clarify, the pharmacy reimbursement pressure, is that still related primarily to your MAC-based contracts instead of the AWP deals? And also, is the pressure there related more -- potentially more to Medicare Part D? Or is it commercial? Or is it both? Just trying to get more color on the reimbursement.\n\n---\n\nSure. It's -- it is not solely related to MAC-based contracts. It also has to do with, again, contracts that have been under negotiation, contracts that we know are coming up in our view and estimates of those impacts, migration amongst plans, migration inside of plans. All of those things are starting to get to really blend the numbers that make up our estimates today and have in the past. In terms of where it is, it is not isolated to Med D. It's really we're looking at our total look of business and we see impacts across that book of business.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just quickly on the McKesson deal. Obviously, it's been talked about a little bit already here. But I think -- for me, I think of it, as something that would just sort of gain momentum and improve over time. So I guess I'm still trying to better understand the mechanics on how this sort of hurt your fiscal 1Q, and it seems to provide some pretty good upside, obviously, in the just-reported fiscal 2Q. But then based on the guidance, it seems like it's going to be kind of neutral to negative in the back half of the fiscal year. So I'm just trying to figure out just more color on what you said about some of those negative offsets and why it wouldn't just sort of improve as time goes on.\n\n---\n\nWell, I think -- yes. The first quarter was a difficult transition for us. We were working our way into the relationship. And I think as we talked about, we were pretty unsupported in the marketplace during that first quarter. We really had no levers to work with to help mitigate some of the generic cost inflation that we saw during the first quarter and the reimbursement rate pressure. I think, in the second quarter, we saw pretty much a good strong benefit from the purchasing arrangement with McKesson that really helped drive the second quarter results. And I think if reimbursement rates stayed right where they are right this second, we think the third and fourth quarter would be good, too. But we think the reimbursement rate pressure is going to be tougher in the third and fourth quarter, and it's going to erode some of the savings that we're generating from the McKesson arrangement. I guess it's the best way I can describe it.\n\n---\n\nIn your mind right now -- it's the final one here. With McKesson, do you think that once they add in the Celesio volume, will that lead to a lot of incremental savings from your perspective?\n\n---\n\nI hope so.\n\n---\n\nWelcome, Darren, by the way.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Ed.\n\n---\n\nWhatever this next question is, Darren is going to answer it.\n\n---\n\nSo, John, my question is, again, on reimbursement rate pressure, so we'll continue to beat this horse. It's always been there, right? I mean, you've talked about reimbursement rate pressure for as long as I can remember, but it hasn't historically been this type of forecasting problem. So why is the pressure intensifying? Why is the outlook for the business changing so rapidly? What's different here today?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think touched on a couple of things. One is we have much lower profitability from new generics this year versus other years. And so to some extent, we probably agreed to some rates based on some assumptions we had that haven't fully come to bear, so that's a piece of the puzzle right there. I think it's a competitive marketplace out there. I think there are some probably dynamics at work in the PBM marketplace as well as in the federal and state governments that are also playing in to some of the activity that we see from a reimbursement rate perspective. Those are probably the broader trends I can point at.\n\n---\n\nNow rates are not set sort of beginning of the year, but I guess what you're saying is that they can continue to move around throughout the year.\n\n---\n\nYes, so a couple things there to think about. I mean, one, as you'd expect, there's probably some variation in rates amongst our book of business, so there is migration that occurs throughout the year amongst payers. There's also various rates inside of an individual payer, and we do have movement inside of those plans within a year. And then we have contracts that come up throughout the year.\n\n---\n\nAll right. And this is probably a hard question to answer because things continue to move around here. But what do you think the outlook is for reimbursement rates on sort of an ongoing basis? I mean, the calendar sort of picks up next year. But if we think about the underlying business, do we just assume this level of intensity each year as we think about your business?\n\n---\n\nWe do. We think the reimbursement rate environment remains competitive for some of the reasons that we just talked about, but we also believe that the strategic arrangement with McKesson will help us continue to be an efficient provider in the marketplace. We think we will continue to have opportunities to drive our top line growth through the various initiatives that we're working on that seem to be getting some traction. So reimbursement rate is just always going to be there. I think this is a bit of a unique year with some different dynamics that we have going on inside our own company as well as some dynamics in the marketplace. But overall, we remain optimistic about the future of our business and our company.\n\n---\n\nJohn, just a bigger-question picture question. Is -- I know you can work on the cost side, right? But is there an answer, strategically, for reimbursements? When you think about these models, right, I mean, obviously, Walgreens has had some problems as well. But CVS doesn't seem to be having as many problems. I mean, is there the opportunity for a better mouse trap? I mean, just how do we think about the business in that light?\n\n---\n\nI'll tell you -- I mean, I'll tell you this. I do think that, at the end of the day, we do bring value to the equation in terms of what we do, and I think we're increasing that value every day with the various initiatives that we're working on in terms of things we're doing for chronic care and polychronic care, the counseling services that we continue to extend at the pharmacy. And so I think the strategic answer to this thing down the road is, while today, we have kind of a gross margin -- honestly, a gross margin model, it's a buy low, sell high kind of negotiation that we have with these PBMs. Ultimately, I think the marketplace will recognize us for the value that we bring in patient care. And I don't think that -- that's not something that's going to happen overnight. But in terms -- from a strategic perspective, over time, that's where the real value in this relationship is created.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And just one final question for you, just so we don't run the risk of blowing things out of proportion here. But as we think about your guidance where we started off the year, we're 9%, 10% lower on EBITDA. How much of that do you think is McKesson ramped up maybe slower than what you initially thought. Nexium gets delayed versus sort of structural things like rate pressure?\n\n---\n\nProbably 1/2 to 2/3 of it.\n\n---\n\n1/2 to 2/3 is...\n\n---\n\nIs the McKesson and Nexium and all that stuff.\n\n---\n\nAnd the rest is the rate pressure?\n\n---\n\nThe rest is the rate pressure. And I think the first quarter really suffered from the transition, and that's going to be a chunk of our decline year-over-year.\n\n---\n\nMaybe -- you can probably guess I'm going to drill on kind of reimbursement a little bit more. I guess, can you talk about maybe the earnings cadence of the year? And how should we think about the changes in reimbursement? I think a lot of us think of these reimbursement changes as kind of kicking up in the beginning of the year as that indicated. So like is there -- is Q4 going to be meaningfully weaker than Q3? And I guess any color you can give us kind of on earnings cadence and how we should think about the timing, that's helpful.\n\n---\n\nYes. I -- we don't normally kind of give you a quarterly guidance, but it is a factual statement that we do have planned changes going on in January 1. So that is one of several timing factors that impact reimbursement rates.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So I guess -- so the answer to that might be, yes, we should probably think of Q4 as weaker than Q3.\n\n---\n\nI'm going to -- I'm not going to take the bait.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I'll keep fishing then. And then...\n\n---\n\nTry some different bait.\n\n---\n\nAnd then let's talk about like you talked about the mix a little bit. And should -- how much of the change in the reimbursement should we think of as the change -- what I'll just call pressure from payers in aggregate versus movement of the plan members and mix between different benefit products? Like is more of the pressure being caused by...\n\n---\n\nThey're both kind of the same thing, to some degree, because we're filling that same script at a lower rate, whether they migrated to a narrow network plan or some other product or they migrated between payers or a payer just flat-out lowered their rate. It is all those things combined together.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then this last one, kind of also asked another way. I think you just answered this with the last question. I just want to hear it one more time. I'm trying to kind of understand the amplitude of the impacts. So it sounded like you said in the previous question that if we look at the step-down in the guidance on the year, reimbursement is about half and McKesson is about half. I'm trying to get the sense for if we look at the $125 million EBITDA reduction for the year, it sounds like half of that is the delay in McKesson coming on and half of that is the delay of -- or changes in reimbursement. And just given it's like -- it's kind of a half year impact for McKesson, McKesson could potentially double that on an annualized basis and we should expect...\n\n---\n\nEd, I'm not following any of that math. I mean, I think in terms of McKesson, what happened with McKesson was really a timing issue in terms of when we got the bid to market, when we were able to purchase the products at the new cost, those kinds of things. That really incurred during the first quarter. That, in my mind, is a bit of a onetime issue. And I think our second quarter results -- or kind of proof in pudding on that as McKesson arrangement is now producing some savings in the current quarter that you're looking at right now, which is probably the reason why it came out as nicely at as it did. So -- and then we sort of look at impacts and the occurrence of kind of have the $60 million from the first quarter, which is really a bit of a timing play, I think, with McKesson. We look at the current guidance exchange, I think with talked about 3 things there. We talked about Nexium, really, that we thought we would get some benefit from in the fourth quarter that's slipping into next year. We talked about a number of newer generics that lost exclusivity that will get more manufacturers as time goes on, which will drive some cost out, which we thought we would get this year, which probably falls into next year. And then we talked about reimbursement rate pressure here in the back half. So again, I think you got to stir all those things together in your thinking.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just last tack-on maybe. As I understand the McKesson contract, you guys have a good level of kind of price visibility and price certainty on the generics side that you see with them, I guess. Can you talk about how long that price visibility or price certainty extends? Is that just for this fiscal year? Does that extend beyond this year?\n\n---\n\nWell, prices in the marketplace change all the time. I mean -- so there's no guarantees in life as it relates to any price on any one product. Our relationships with vendors supply us, allow us things like price protection and things like that can help us have more certainty about prices over a short period of time. But over a longer period of time, it's going to be a constant purchasing effort no longer -- no different than it has been in the past. We work very closely with McKesson in that process. We have visibility to drug cost every day in terms of what's in the marketplace and what we're purchasing at.\n\n---\n\nI first have a bigger strategic question and that's really around your comment around valuing patient care. How do you think you get paid for that over time? I mean, we talked a lot today about reimbursement pressure. Do you think that it'll be narrow networks and you get more volume? Is it do you, in some way, get a better reimbursement? Or you actually get paid for the cognitive services that you're providing to the patient? How do we think about that going forward? And then just going back to something Ed said earlier, do you think you need to have a closer relationship with someone like a PBM, where you're their preferred pharmacy or something along those lines of JV type of relationship in order for this to really help to alleviate some of the reimbursement issues?\n\n---\n\nSo I think the concept that I think we have to understand a little bit is that the value that we create through what we do today is not by having the absolute lowest cost on the pill that we purchased. I mean, honestly, average generic drug cost that we sell is maybe $25, $27, something like that. And so how much money are we going to save on a $25 or $30 prescription? That's not really the question at the end of the day. The question is, is the patient compliant? Are they getting the counseling they need? Do they understand what they need to do to improve their health and stay out of emergency rooms and doctors' offices? So again, we're talking philosophically here. I do not have the specific answer on how this migration is going to occur. But I think, over time, there's only so many dollars we're going to be able to squeeze out of the drug spend, particularly on the generic side. And so it's really going to come down to then what differentiates you in the marketplace is not that you can fill that script for $24 versus $25. It's what did you do to help the patient? So at some point, I think the model migrates to something more where maybe there's a reimbursement for the service that you're providing to the patient versus trying to make gross margin on the script. Is that going to happen tomorrow? It's not. But I think if we look over the longer term, that's really probably the model that our industry needs to begin the migration to over some period of time.\n\n---\n\nAnd do you think you need to have a closer relationship? I mean, clearly, the numbers have spoken that CVS has performed better than the peers and they have Caremark. Do you think you need a closer relationship with a PBM entity to be able to capture some of these things that you're talking about?\n\n---\n\nI don't think necessarily that's the case. I'm not -- again, here, I don't want to get into an argument whether if the Caremark model is the right model or the wrong model. It has certainly been an effective model in the marketplace. And I think you can see it certainly provides certain advantages relative to where we sit today on a stand-alone basis. I guess I wouldn't argue with that. But if I look down the road again and think about drug spend and kind of where it's going, I think the real question is, can we bring value at retail? We touch patients more than anybody else in the whole equation here. So as I kind of come back to it, at the end of the day, I think what we have to sort of work towards is it's just -- it isn't so much about, again, putting the cheapest pill in the bottle. It's really about what kind of value can we bring to the patient relationship. Do we need a PBM necessarily to do that? Not necessarily, quite honestly. The direct relationships that we're building with providers gives us a lot of information and capabilities to directly interact with that patient in a way that we would never be able to get that information from a PBM. They don't have that information either. The provider does. And by working directly with the provider, we're gaining access to a view of the patient that we just never had before and now have the capabilities to help that patient in ways we never had before. And somehow, that's got us stir [ph] into the long-term, I think, strategic landing for where we're going.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then I know that you talked about the $115 million to $125 million of EBITDA, and you talked about 2/3 -- 1/2 to 2/3 being McKesson, Nexium and generics. And so therefore, the other 1/2 or 1/3 is reimbursement. I just want to make sure that we have this correct. So as we think about going forward, maybe not necessarily towards the back half of this the this year, but as we go into next year, is it correct to think that McKesson is going to reverse itself, we're ultimately going to get Nexium as we move into next year? And as you talked about a number of these generic drugs that have an application will come to market, so that aspect should somewhat reverse itself and the reimbursement is just going to continue to be reimbursement pressure?\n\n---\n\nI think that's right. I'll just clarify a couple of things. And the thing with McKesson was really a timing issue in terms of just getting a thing implemented, and it's important to understand that it was a massive transition for our company. I mean, we've put in a huge amount of effort, and so did McKesson, to get this thing done in the timeframe that we did. I really believe, strategically, we're headed in the right direction here. I mean, I think our combined purchasing power is going to help us get the lowest cost over time, so we're really excited about where we came out here on this thing. And I got to tell you, our stores love the service that they're getting. This 5 deliveries a week is such a big change from once a week for the vast majority of our stores where we were before. It's really helping from a customer service perspective. So that piece right there, I think, was just a timing transition thing that we had to work through. The Nexium, we've talked about. On the loss of exclusivity, I'll just clean that up a little bit. Those are drugs that are already generics. The generic manufacturer that got it had an exclusivity period. That exclusivity period expired. And either no one else has come to make that drug or those that have come are not as many as we expected. The more manufacturers we get for that drug, the lower the cost. What we can see is that, for some of those drugs, there will be more manufacturers next year, so we do think there's some benefit there for us next year instead of this year, same thing with Nexium. That's going to move into next year. So to your point, as we sort of stand back and look at it, we know reimbursement rate will continue to be a challenge next year. As we get closer to guiding for next year, we'll have more view towards what that pressure is going to be and how all these other things will stir together to help us navigate through that.\n\n---\n\nIt's Mark Wiltamuth from Jefferies. Well, amidst all this concern on the margin rates, you did show some solid expansion from Medicaid states. If you could maybe quantify how much that helped the comp and if you think there's more expansion to go there on the comp front.\n\n---\n\nIt is a very significant part of the comp, having a big impact to, I think, on the pharmacy margin. I think that's going to continue to grow over time as patients utilize the benefits that they receive there. On a much, much, much smaller basis, there is a -- starting to be a developing trend there. As we talked about before, there are some plans, Mark, where they are fairly specific to exchange-based health care. It doesn't cover all the exchange, but there's a few that are pretty focused on the exchanges. And even those are starting -- they're not material yet to the total number, but those are actually growing pretty rapidly right now, too. So we're hopeful that as more and more patients gain access here to health care, we're going to continue to see opportunities to grow our script count.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And as you head down the strategic path and kind of provided more value at retail, obviously, the RediClinics factor into that. How aggressive are you going to be on adding those this year and next year?\n\n---\n\nWe're going to -- I think we're pretty much in line with our original expectations there. Ken, I don't know if you have any other...\n\n---\n\nYes. I think we're tracking right on target. And we're going to start opening in several months, so you're going to see them aggressively rolling out. And we're very excited about the opportunity that lies ahead of us here.\n\n---\n\nAnd is there a sizable CapEx investment to do that remodel? Or does that just get folded into the broader remodel plans you have?\n\n---\n\nIt's in our numbers, guidance numbers.\n\n---\n\nIt's in our guidance. But it's -- some or both, there'll be some stores we put them in that have either already been remodeled and then there are going to be ones we put them in as we remodel. Is that right?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's a combination. Some of it are going into existing Wellness Stores. When we're putting these things up, we're trying to make sure that if the store hasn't been modified, we're going in and trying to update it and do a wellness remodel. But again, that would be tracking with our original plan. So there's not a lot of CapEx above and beyond what we already talked about.\n\n---\n\nAnd do you have any thoughts on if you got any incrementality on scripts coming out of those clinics?\n\n---\n\nWe certainly hope we're going to get some incremental scripts and probably, some incremental front-end business will come along with it as well.\n\n---\n\nWhen we look at the takeout of the 10.25% notes with the revolver, I mean, is the expectation that we would use the free cash flow just to kind of pay that off as it comes in?\n\n---\n\nYes, that is the expectation.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then with your competitor, CVS, exiting the tobacco market, I mean, what have you seen in terms of traffic in that category for sales for you guys?\n\n---\n\nIt's -- whatever's happening out there is -- it's not much. I think, really, what's happening at our stores -- and it's been a little quiet because of all the noise that they've made -- but we rolled out a fairly extensive smoking cessation program about 3 or 4 weeks ago. And we're pretty excited. We're getting some early takeaway and the patients seem to be reacting well to it, and so we're really focused on smoking cessation more than we are in retail sales of tobacco, at this point.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just lastly, and I really don't want to ask another question on reimbursement, but...\n\n---\n\nGo ahead, come on.\n\n---\n\nJust so I'm clear, in terms of that period of exclusivity, I mean, you just mentioned you thought there would be more production and hopefully, there's from production on the horizon for some of these drugs that have lost exclusivity. It is my kind of takeaway here that the reimbursement rates kind of on those drugs have already come down, but the cost just hasn't until that manufacturing picks up? Is that the disconnect that you guys are seeing right now in the market?\n\n---\n\nWell, also, just -- I hate to even bring it up. But remember that for many of our contracts, the reimbursement rate is fixed. So had the cost been lower on those drugs, we would have made more profitability. \r\nAnd I think that wraps up today's call. Thank you very much for joining us.\n\n---\n\nYes. Thank you, everybody.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nSo guys, a few things. You talked about the $40 million valuation -- inventory valuation item as being not material for the year. Is that because there is an offset in other quarters? Or because $40 million on the base of $1.2 billion is not material?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nThere's offsets coming in the third and fourth quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nTotaling roughly $40 million or close to it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYes, close to it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nAnd then those relate to what? The same valuation item or something else?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYes. So as we're making this transition, there is a -- inventory valuation is impacted from a number of different items. So they all relate to inventory valuation but relate to allowances and cost capitalization, all kinds of things, kind of moving through to the numbers as we make this transition.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nAll right. And then secondly, is reimbursement -- when you think about it, it's not as -- it's worse than you thought it might be. Is that because -- I'm also thinking about generic inflation in here. Are those -- has those things gotten worse in the past 2, 3, 4 months? Or they haven't improved the way you thought they might in the back half?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nSo we'll break that into 2 pieces. The first animal is really reimbursement rates, and I would say the reimbursement rate environment seems a little tougher in the back half than we expected. And I'm sure, as you know, John, the reimbursement rate view evolves all the time. We're -- have plans that are in negotiation and we have migrations inside the plans, and a number of different things going on all the time related to reimbursement rates. So that's a view we're constantly updating and sort of looking at. And based on what we can see at this time, the back half looks a little tougher than we initially expected or -- expected, even as of June, so that's kind of where we sit. On the generic inflation front, I mean, I think the good news is we're making some good progress in our purchasing arrangement with McKesson. And so I think on the margin side in terms of costs, we had a pretty darn good quarter here this quarter, and we're expecting to continue to make good progress there across the back half.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then lastly, when do you now think Nexium begins to positively impact you? Next fiscal year or...\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYes, it's next fiscal year. I mean, it feels like in our fiscal year, there -- or [ph] probably be the first or second quarter based on what we know today.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Jones (Analysts)】\nThe reimbursement issue is something we've been talking about now for several quarters, and it sounds like it got even worse than what you guys thought it was just 3 months ago. I guess, just maybe to level-set everyone, how well of a handle do you feel like you have on this dynamic today? And then maybe just to help us out, it doesn't necessarily sound like generic inflation itself is the issue. It's really the rate at which your reimbursement rate catches up. I mean, how -- I guess how much exposure do you have to this today? And are there are tangible meaningful things you can do to kind of right this discrepancy in the way you're reimbursed?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYes. So in terms of our view and our handle on it, we do have good information for a piece of our business. All of our -- we have a number of fixed-rate contracts we have talked about in the past. But even inside of those plans, there are different levels of rates. And we have migration around inside of those plans, we have migration amongst payers as well as constant contract negotiations going on all the time. So there are a number of dynamics that we do have to estimate, so it is not a perfect science for sure. Having said that, it's also important to keep in mind that we dispense, at the AWP level, about $40 billion worth of drugs a year. So even a modest few basis points in reimbursement rate change in our view can have an impact on earnings, so that's just the way it is. And I think this year may be compared to last year or the year before or the year before that. One significant difference is we do not have as much profitability from new generics that we've had in the past, so whereas we may have seen some volatility in reimbursement rate, we also had a lot of profitability in the generics. And so maybe it just wasn't as visible maybe versus where we're at right this moment. A couple of things that are slipping here are in fact, slipping. We talked about Nexium already. We also had some newer generics that lost exclusivity that didn't come to market as profitably as we thought, honestly, in part because there just weren't as many manufacturers as we expected, but we can see FDA applications coming in on a number of those items. And so we think those are items that are really probably moving to next year. So we'll probably maybe catch up a little bit as those items bring us some profitability into next year. So I think that's all good news. But I think we're going continue to have to work through the reimbursement rate environment that we're in. We're going to have to be efficient. We're going to have to continue to work on the purchasing side as hard as we can and pick away at this thing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Jones (Analysts)】\nThat's fair. And then I guess that kind of leads into my next question in thinking about how unique this year is versus next year. Back half typically better than the front half. Obviously, this year, a lot of different dynamics at play. Probably, that's not the case. But as we think about the back half as a jumping off point into next year, are you guys viewing, even preliminarily, that you'll be able to kind of return to EBITDA growth next year? And I only asked this because from a high level, this year, given the -- other than the reimbursement issues, you did have a positive script trend. The McKesson benefit should help you in the back half. Just trying to think about putting the back half in context of fiscal '16.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYes. It's certainly a fair question, and we're going to probably be careful not to give guidance, at this point, based on where we're at today. But we do have some very positive tailwinds to help us. We do have strong momentum on the top line. We are working on a number of initiatives, including the McKesson arrangement. Lots of exciting things going on at retail that Ken is really pushing through the business here. So we remain optimistic about next year. But probably, we're not in a position to give you guidance today.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Valiquette (Analysts)】\nSo just to clarify, the pharmacy reimbursement pressure, is that still related primarily to your MAC-based contracts instead of the AWP deals? And also, is the pressure there related more -- potentially more to Medicare Part D? Or is it commercial? Or is it both? Just trying to get more color on the reimbursement.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nSure. It's -- it is not solely related to MAC-based contracts. It also has to do with, again, contracts that have been under negotiation, contracts that we know are coming up in our view and estimates of those impacts, migration amongst plans, migration inside of plans. All of those things are starting to get to really blend the numbers that make up our estimates today and have in the past. In terms of where it is, it is not isolated to Med D. It's really we're looking at our total look of business and we see impacts across that book of business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Valiquette (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just quickly on the McKesson deal. Obviously, it's been talked about a little bit already here. But I think -- for me, I think of it, as something that would just sort of gain momentum and improve over time. So I guess I'm still trying to better understand the mechanics on how this sort of hurt your fiscal 1Q, and it seems to provide some pretty good upside, obviously, in the just-reported fiscal 2Q. But then based on the guidance, it seems like it's going to be kind of neutral to negative in the back half of the fiscal year. So I'm just trying to figure out just more color on what you said about some of those negative offsets and why it wouldn't just sort of improve as time goes on.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWell, I think -- yes. The first quarter was a difficult transition for us. We were working our way into the relationship. And I think as we talked about, we were pretty unsupported in the marketplace during that first quarter. We really had no levers to work with to help mitigate some of the generic cost inflation that we saw during the first quarter and the reimbursement rate pressure. I think, in the second quarter, we saw pretty much a good strong benefit from the purchasing arrangement with McKesson that really helped drive the second quarter results. And I think if reimbursement rates stayed right where they are right this second, we think the third and fourth quarter would be good, too. But we think the reimbursement rate pressure is going to be tougher in the third and fourth quarter, and it's going to erode some of the savings that we're generating from the McKesson arrangement. I guess it's the best way I can describe it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Valiquette (Analysts)】\nIn your mind right now -- it's the final one here. With McKesson, do you think that once they add in the Celesio volume, will that lead to a lot of incremental savings from your perspective?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI hope so.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nWelcome, Darren, by the way.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Darren Karst (Executives)】\nThanks, Ed.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWhatever this next question is, Darren is going to answer it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nSo, John, my question is, again, on reimbursement rate pressure, so we'll continue to beat this horse. It's always been there, right? I mean, you've talked about reimbursement rate pressure for as long as I can remember, but it hasn't historically been this type of forecasting problem. So why is the pressure intensifying? Why is the outlook for the business changing so rapidly? What's different here today?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWell, I think touched on a couple of things. One is we have much lower profitability from new generics this year versus other years. And so to some extent, we probably agreed to some rates based on some assumptions we had that haven't fully come to bear, so that's a piece of the puzzle right there. I think it's a competitive marketplace out there. I think there are some probably dynamics at work in the PBM marketplace as well as in the federal and state governments that are also playing in to some of the activity that we see from a reimbursement rate perspective. Those are probably the broader trends I can point at.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nNow rates are not set sort of beginning of the year, but I guess what you're saying is that they can continue to move around throughout the year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYes, so a couple things there to think about. I mean, one, as you'd expect, there's probably some variation in rates amongst our book of business, so there is migration that occurs throughout the year amongst payers. There's also various rates inside of an individual payer, and we do have movement inside of those plans within a year. And then we have contracts that come up throughout the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nAll right. And this is probably a hard question to answer because things continue to move around here. But what do you think the outlook is for reimbursement rates on sort of an ongoing basis? I mean, the calendar sort of picks up next year. But if we think about the underlying business, do we just assume this level of intensity each year as we think about your business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWe do. We think the reimbursement rate environment remains competitive for some of the reasons that we just talked about, but we also believe that the strategic arrangement with McKesson will help us continue to be an efficient provider in the marketplace. We think we will continue to have opportunities to drive our top line growth through the various initiatives that we're working on that seem to be getting some traction. So reimbursement rate is just always going to be there. I think this is a bit of a unique year with some different dynamics that we have going on inside our own company as well as some dynamics in the marketplace. But overall, we remain optimistic about the future of our business and our company.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nJohn, just a bigger-question picture question. Is -- I know you can work on the cost side, right? But is there an answer, strategically, for reimbursements? When you think about these models, right, I mean, obviously, Walgreens has had some problems as well. But CVS doesn't seem to be having as many problems. I mean, is there the opportunity for a better mouse trap? I mean, just how do we think about the business in that light?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI'll tell you -- I mean, I'll tell you this. I do think that, at the end of the day, we do bring value to the equation in terms of what we do, and I think we're increasing that value every day with the various initiatives that we're working on in terms of things we're doing for chronic care and polychronic care, the counseling services that we continue to extend at the pharmacy. And so I think the strategic answer to this thing down the road is, while today, we have kind of a gross margin -- honestly, a gross margin model, it's a buy low, sell high kind of negotiation that we have with these PBMs. Ultimately, I think the marketplace will recognize us for the value that we bring in patient care. And I don't think that -- that's not something that's going to happen overnight. But in terms -- from a strategic perspective, over time, that's where the real value in this relationship is created.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nGreat. And just one final question for you, just so we don't run the risk of blowing things out of proportion here. But as we think about your guidance where we started off the year, we're 9%, 10% lower on EBITDA. How much of that do you think is McKesson ramped up maybe slower than what you initially thought. Nexium gets delayed versus sort of structural things like rate pressure?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nProbably 1/2 to 2/3 of it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\n1/2 to 2/3 is...\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nIs the McKesson and Nexium and all that stuff.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nAnd the rest is the rate pressure?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nThe rest is the rate pressure. And I think the first quarter really suffered from the transition, and that's going to be a chunk of our decline year-over-year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Hill (Analysts)】\nMaybe -- you can probably guess I'm going to drill on kind of reimbursement a little bit more. I guess, can you talk about maybe the earnings cadence of the year? And how should we think about the changes in reimbursement? I think a lot of us think of these reimbursement changes as kind of kicking up in the beginning of the year as that indicated. So like is there -- is Q4 going to be meaningfully weaker than Q3? And I guess any color you can give us kind of on earnings cadence and how we should think about the timing, that's helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nYes. I -- we don't normally kind of give you a quarterly guidance, but it is a factual statement that we do have planned changes going on in January 1. So that is one of several timing factors that impact reimbursement rates.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Hill (Analysts)】\nOkay. So I guess -- so the answer to that might be, yes, we should probably think of Q4 as weaker than Q3.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI'm going to -- I'm not going to take the bait.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Hill (Analysts)】\nOkay. I'll keep fishing then. And then...\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nTry some different bait.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Hill (Analysts)】\nAnd then let's talk about like you talked about the mix a little bit. And should -- how much of the change in the reimbursement should we think of as the change -- what I'll just call pressure from payers in aggregate versus movement of the plan members and mix between different benefit products? Like is more of the pressure being caused by...\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nThey're both kind of the same thing, to some degree, because we're filling that same script at a lower rate, whether they migrated to a narrow network plan or some other product or they migrated between payers or a payer just flat-out lowered their rate. It is all those things combined together.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Hill (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then this last one, kind of also asked another way. I think you just answered this with the last question. I just want to hear it one more time. I'm trying to kind of understand the amplitude of the impacts. So it sounded like you said in the previous question that if we look at the step-down in the guidance on the year, reimbursement is about half and McKesson is about half. I'm trying to get the sense for if we look at the $125 million EBITDA reduction for the year, it sounds like half of that is the delay in McKesson coming on and half of that is the delay of -- or changes in reimbursement. And just given it's like -- it's kind of a half year impact for McKesson, McKesson could potentially double that on an annualized basis and we should expect...\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nEd, I'm not following any of that math. I mean, I think in terms of McKesson, what happened with McKesson was really a timing issue in terms of when we got the bid to market, when we were able to purchase the products at the new cost, those kinds of things. That really incurred during the first quarter. That, in my mind, is a bit of a onetime issue. And I think our second quarter results -- or kind of proof in pudding on that as McKesson arrangement is now producing some savings in the current quarter that you're looking at right now, which is probably the reason why it came out as nicely at as it did. So -- and then we sort of look at impacts and the occurrence of kind of have the $60 million from the first quarter, which is really a bit of a timing play, I think, with McKesson. We look at the current guidance exchange, I think with talked about 3 things there. We talked about Nexium, really, that we thought we would get some benefit from in the fourth quarter that's slipping into next year. We talked about a number of newer generics that lost exclusivity that will get more manufacturers as time goes on, which will drive some cost out, which we thought we would get this year, which probably falls into next year. And then we talked about reimbursement rate pressure here in the back half. So again, I think you got to stir all those things together in your thinking.\n\n---\n\n【質問: George Hill (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just last tack-on maybe. As I understand the McKesson contract, you guys have a good level of kind of price visibility and price certainty on the generics side that you see with them, I guess. Can you talk about how long that price visibility or price certainty extends? Is that just for this fiscal year? Does that extend beyond this year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWell, prices in the marketplace change all the time. I mean -- so there's no guarantees in life as it relates to any price on any one product. Our relationships with vendors supply us, allow us things like price protection and things like that can help us have more certainty about prices over a short period of time. But over a longer period of time, it's going to be a constant purchasing effort no longer -- no different than it has been in the past. We work very closely with McKesson in that process. We have visibility to drug cost every day in terms of what's in the marketplace and what we're purchasing at.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Gill (Analysts)】\nI first have a bigger strategic question and that's really around your comment around valuing patient care. How do you think you get paid for that over time? I mean, we talked a lot today about reimbursement pressure. Do you think that it'll be narrow networks and you get more volume? Is it do you, in some way, get a better reimbursement? Or you actually get paid for the cognitive services that you're providing to the patient? How do we think about that going forward? And then just going back to something Ed said earlier, do you think you need to have a closer relationship with someone like a PBM, where you're their preferred pharmacy or something along those lines of JV type of relationship in order for this to really help to alleviate some of the reimbursement issues?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nSo I think the concept that I think we have to understand a little bit is that the value that we create through what we do today is not by having the absolute lowest cost on the pill that we purchased. I mean, honestly, average generic drug cost that we sell is maybe $25, $27, something like that. And so how much money are we going to save on a $25 or $30 prescription? That's not really the question at the end of the day. The question is, is the patient compliant? Are they getting the counseling they need? Do they understand what they need to do to improve their health and stay out of emergency rooms and doctors' offices? So again, we're talking philosophically here. I do not have the specific answer on how this migration is going to occur. But I think, over time, there's only so many dollars we're going to be able to squeeze out of the drug spend, particularly on the generic side. And so it's really going to come down to then what differentiates you in the marketplace is not that you can fill that script for $24 versus $25. It's what did you do to help the patient? So at some point, I think the model migrates to something more where maybe there's a reimbursement for the service that you're providing to the patient versus trying to make gross margin on the script. Is that going to happen tomorrow? It's not. But I think if we look over the longer term, that's really probably the model that our industry needs to begin the migration to over some period of time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Gill (Analysts)】\nAnd do you think you need to have a closer relationship? I mean, clearly, the numbers have spoken that CVS has performed better than the peers and they have Caremark. Do you think you need a closer relationship with a PBM entity to be able to capture some of these things that you're talking about?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI don't think necessarily that's the case. I'm not -- again, here, I don't want to get into an argument whether if the Caremark model is the right model or the wrong model. It has certainly been an effective model in the marketplace. And I think you can see it certainly provides certain advantages relative to where we sit today on a stand-alone basis. I guess I wouldn't argue with that. But if I look down the road again and think about drug spend and kind of where it's going, I think the real question is, can we bring value at retail? We touch patients more than anybody else in the whole equation here. So as I kind of come back to it, at the end of the day, I think what we have to sort of work towards is it's just -- it isn't so much about, again, putting the cheapest pill in the bottle. It's really about what kind of value can we bring to the patient relationship. Do we need a PBM necessarily to do that? Not necessarily, quite honestly. The direct relationships that we're building with providers gives us a lot of information and capabilities to directly interact with that patient in a way that we would never be able to get that information from a PBM. They don't have that information either. The provider does. And by working directly with the provider, we're gaining access to a view of the patient that we just never had before and now have the capabilities to help that patient in ways we never had before. And somehow, that's got us stir [ph] into the long-term, I think, strategic landing for where we're going.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Gill (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then I know that you talked about the $115 million to $125 million of EBITDA, and you talked about 2/3 -- 1/2 to 2/3 being McKesson, Nexium and generics. And so therefore, the other 1/2 or 1/3 is reimbursement. I just want to make sure that we have this correct. So as we think about going forward, maybe not necessarily towards the back half of this the this year, but as we go into next year, is it correct to think that McKesson is going to reverse itself, we're ultimately going to get Nexium as we move into next year? And as you talked about a number of these generic drugs that have an application will come to market, so that aspect should somewhat reverse itself and the reimbursement is just going to continue to be reimbursement pressure?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nI think that's right. I'll just clarify a couple of things. And the thing with McKesson was really a timing issue in terms of just getting a thing implemented, and it's important to understand that it was a massive transition for our company. I mean, we've put in a huge amount of effort, and so did McKesson, to get this thing done in the timeframe that we did. I really believe, strategically, we're headed in the right direction here. I mean, I think our combined purchasing power is going to help us get the lowest cost over time, so we're really excited about where we came out here on this thing. And I got to tell you, our stores love the service that they're getting. This 5 deliveries a week is such a big change from once a week for the vast majority of our stores where we were before. It's really helping from a customer service perspective. So that piece right there, I think, was just a timing transition thing that we had to work through. The Nexium, we've talked about. On the loss of exclusivity, I'll just clean that up a little bit. Those are drugs that are already generics. The generic manufacturer that got it had an exclusivity period. That exclusivity period expired. And either no one else has come to make that drug or those that have come are not as many as we expected. The more manufacturers we get for that drug, the lower the cost. What we can see is that, for some of those drugs, there will be more manufacturers next year, so we do think there's some benefit there for us next year instead of this year, same thing with Nexium. That's going to move into next year. So to your point, as we sort of stand back and look at it, we know reimbursement rate will continue to be a challenge next year. As we get closer to guiding for next year, we'll have more view towards what that pressure is going to be and how all these other things will stir together to help us navigate through that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Wiltamuth (Analysts)】\nIt's Mark Wiltamuth from Jefferies. Well, amidst all this concern on the margin rates, you did show some solid expansion from Medicaid states. If you could maybe quantify how much that helped the comp and if you think there's more expansion to go there on the comp front.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nIt is a very significant part of the comp, having a big impact to, I think, on the pharmacy margin. I think that's going to continue to grow over time as patients utilize the benefits that they receive there. On a much, much, much smaller basis, there is a -- starting to be a developing trend there. As we talked about before, there are some plans, Mark, where they are fairly specific to exchange-based health care. It doesn't cover all the exchange, but there's a few that are pretty focused on the exchanges. And even those are starting -- they're not material yet to the total number, but those are actually growing pretty rapidly right now, too. So we're hopeful that as more and more patients gain access here to health care, we're going to continue to see opportunities to grow our script count.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Wiltamuth (Analysts)】\nOkay. And as you head down the strategic path and kind of provided more value at retail, obviously, the RediClinics factor into that. How aggressive are you going to be on adding those this year and next year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWe're going to -- I think we're pretty much in line with our original expectations there. Ken, I don't know if you have any other...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nYes. I think we're tracking right on target. And we're going to start opening in several months, so you're going to see them aggressively rolling out. And we're very excited about the opportunity that lies ahead of us here.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Wiltamuth (Analysts)】\nAnd is there a sizable CapEx investment to do that remodel? Or does that just get folded into the broader remodel plans you have?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Darren Karst (Executives)】\nIt's in our numbers, guidance numbers.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nIt's in our guidance. But it's -- some or both, there'll be some stores we put them in that have either already been remodeled and then there are going to be ones we put them in as we remodel. Is that right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nYes, it's a combination. Some of it are going into existing Wellness Stores. When we're putting these things up, we're trying to make sure that if the store hasn't been modified, we're going in and trying to update it and do a wellness remodel. But again, that would be tracking with our original plan. So there's not a lot of CapEx above and beyond what we already talked about.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Wiltamuth (Analysts)】\nAnd do you have any thoughts on if you got any incrementality on scripts coming out of those clinics?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nWe certainly hope we're going to get some incremental scripts and probably, some incremental front-end business will come along with it as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karru Martinson (Analysts)】\nWhen we look at the takeout of the 10.25% notes with the revolver, I mean, is the expectation that we would use the free cash flow just to kind of pay that off as it comes in?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Darren Karst (Executives)】\nYes, that is the expectation.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karru Martinson (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then with your competitor, CVS, exiting the tobacco market, I mean, what have you seen in terms of traffic in that category for sales for you guys?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kenneth Martindale (Executives)】\nIt's -- whatever's happening out there is -- it's not much. I think, really, what's happening at our stores -- and it's been a little quiet because of all the noise that they've made -- but we rolled out a fairly extensive smoking cessation program about 3 or 4 weeks ago. And we're pretty excited. We're getting some early takeaway and the patients seem to be reacting well to it, and so we're really focused on smoking cessation more than we are in retail sales of tobacco, at this point.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karru Martinson (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just lastly, and I really don't want to ask another question on reimbursement, but...\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nGo ahead, come on.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karru Martinson (Analysts)】\nJust so I'm clear, in terms of that period of exclusivity, I mean, you just mentioned you thought there would be more production and hopefully, there's from production on the horizon for some of these drugs that have lost exclusivity. It is my kind of takeaway here that the reimbursement rates kind of on those drugs have already come down, but the cost just hasn't until that manufacturing picks up? Is that the disconnect that you guys are seeing right now in the market?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Standley (Executives)】\nWell, also, just -- I hate to even bring it up. But remember that for many of our contracts, the reimbursement rate is fixed. So had the cost been lower on those drugs, we would have made more profitability. \r\nAnd I think that wraps up today's call. Thank you very much for joining us.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matt Schroeder (Executives)】\nYes. Thank you, everybody.",

      "transcript_text1": "We're ready to start. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our 6-month's results. We've had a good first 6 months to the 2014-15 year, sales up 10%, profits up 19%, earnings per share up 20%. In the paper, there are various reasons given why we think we've done well, but I think, actually, probably the biggest ones is, there's some evidence that the U.K. economy now has turned the corner, and we are some real growth come through. \r\nOur strategy in NEXT is fairly straightforward, and I'll reiterate it for you. Again, it's improving and then developing our products, expanding and upgrading our retail estate, developing our Directory customer base and, of course, returning cash to our shareholders. Since I became Chairman 8 years ago, that strategy has remained unchanged. It's held us in good stand, it's not likely to change going forward. Looking ahead, we've given some pretty clear indicators of growth in the statement, 10% in this quarter, and 4% in the last quarter of the year. If we achieve that, we would have a good year. Simon?\n\n---\n\nThank you very much. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for making the effort to be here, now I know you've got far more -- many other more important retailers to talk to this morning. Thank you also, I don't know if you got caught in the queue coming in. But a little [indiscernible] thing going on, getting into the UBS this morning, which I've got caught up in myself. There we are, right. The first half of the year, good first half, sales up 10%, profit up 19%. In terms of that -- the difference in sales growth and profit growth, is not quite as big a gap as it looks, full price sales up 11.5%, of the 19%, 2% of it comes off from a swing in the valuation of currency instruments at the half year, there was a GBP 6 million swing in this valuation, that takes it down to around 17%. Ground grew at 16%, most of the margin gain, by far, the biggest elements of the margin gain has come from growth in our existing store sales. \r\nInterests, up on last year, this is all about the issuing of a bond, our underlying interest rates remain broadly flat. We have about -- we have growth debts around GBP 160 million more than last year. Taxation, 20.5%. Last year in the first half, 20%, but for the full year last year, 20.5%, we're expecting the full year of 20.5% this year, the profit after tax up 18.6%. Earnings per share, expected to be up 22%. This is a combined effect of last year's buybacks in the second half and this year's buybacks. Ordinary dividend, increasing from 36p to 50p, that's a very big percentage increase, but the percentage increase in the half-year dividend is really about rebalancing our dividend, and getting it back to where we wanted it to be, which is 1/3 at the half-year, 2/3 at the end. We are forecasting estimates of 150p dividend for the full year, up 16.5%, in line with the central forecast for earnings per share that we've given for our profits. \r\nMoving on to cash flow. Capital expenditure, this is just a reminder of last year's CapEx of GBP 105 million, pretty much the same amount on new space, of GBP 71 million, and we'll open around the same amount of that space this year as last year. GBP 12 million on what we -- maintenance CapEx, this is CapEx that just so -- that keeps the stores looking nice, we don't get a return on it. At the beginning of the year, we estimated that number was going to be GBP 5 million or GBP 6 million having taken a look at our whole portfolio, in particular, the stores, whose assets have depreciated to 0, where we have more than 3 or 4 years left on the lease. We've looked at those stores and decided to spend a little bit of money getting then back in better shape. GBP 34 million on other. I spent some time explaining this at the full year results, 6 months ago, so I'm just going to bring it up as a reminder how that breaks down. The only number that's changed on here since the beginning of the year is the warehouse number. The warehouse number was near GBP 17 million, and it's about, it's GBP 12 million now. The difference is that, at the beginning of the year, actually, it's about GBP 6 million higher. The difference is that at the beginning of the year, we thought we were going to buy the land for our new furniture warehouse, as it is, we're going to lease it, so that comes out of CapEx, but will obviously be a -- there'll be a rental costs there at some point in the future. \r\nIn terms of operating cash flow, GBP 200 million this year in the first half, as against GBP 130 million, GBP 129 million last year. This is the cash flow before special dividends and buybacks. The increase of GBP 70 million is mainly driven by the profit growth at the top, but also, there's a change in the ESOT number. Last year, we were continuing to increase the percentage of the options in outstanding, that we cover in our ESOT. And that meant, we spent GBP 30 million more increasing the cover, that's a permanent reduction in share capital if we keep the ESOT topped up. And so it's -- about GBP 30 million of that is really a buyback in disguise. \r\nIn terms of special dividends, 2 special dividends in the first half, are share buybacks of GBP 105 million. \r\nMoving onto the balance sheet. Assets down 4%, fixed assets down 4%, this is all about depreciation, and running slightly ahead of CapEx. Stock up 15%. Of that stock increase, around 10% is because we expected our sales to be up 10%. The balance is really a timing issue in terms of the stock that was bought in. We bought in stock a little bit earlier for the launch of our autumn season, and our sale was a week later, which meant that at this point in time, we had a little bit more sales stock in the business, that figure has now fallen back to being near in line with sales. \r\nDebtors, up 9%, and that is driven by, mainly by Directory debtors, up 11%, and that, is driven by credit sales, which are up 10%. The increase in credit sales is not because it increased our credit customers, actually, our credit customers have declined in number, and this is about credit customers spending more with us on their account, partly as a result of increasing credit limits for the very best of our customer base, best credit risk that is. And partly, as a result of increased use of our directory account in-store. \r\nNet debt at the half year, GBP 571 million. Just looking forward to the cash flow to the end of the year, we started the year with GBP 517 million of net debt, and we expect to generate around GBP 330 million of operational cash flow, after ordinary dividends, CapEx, interests, et cetera. Off that, we'll, we'd have already spent GBP 223 million in special dividends, 2 in the first half and 1 in August. And on top of that, GBP 105 million of share buybacks, which will take us back to pretty much where we started in terms of debt. You'll notice that our net debt figure for the business is pretty much similar to what it's been for the last 5 or 6 years, and obviously, as our profits have grown, some of you might remark that we could afford to increase our debt in terms of -- and our balance sheet is beginning to look less efficient, and that will be a correct observation. However, we are -- beyond the upper price limit of our share buyback limit, and the time to extend that debt is when we can retire equity, we wouldn't increase debt in order to pay special dividends, that doesn't seem a sensible thing to do. \r\nRetail is the -- the detail of the retail accounts, revenue up 7.5%, 3.8% growth from net space. Increase in space in terms of the percentage increase in the square footage was 4.4%, you'll notice that that is a much higher return on the square footage. We would normally expect to around a 65% return, that's a -- pretty much for the last 10 years the average will be around 60%, between 60% and 65%. The reason for that is just the small number of very high density big shops we've owned: Camberley, Northampton and Braehead Glasgow, be 3 of the -- are the 3 stores that have driven that the most. In terms of profit, profit margins, moving forward significantly in retail, marked down a positive movement, 0.3. Two opposing things going on here: First of all, the good news is, we had less stock to go, into the sale and full-price sales round ahead of marked down sales. The bad news is, we had only 1% less stock, but 4% lower markdown sales. We think that's partly because we delayed the sale a week. Every 6 years we have to push it back a week as it comes to, ticks forward, looking partly, there's an effect there. Partly, it's a return to more normal levels of clearance. The clearance rate we achieved in both Retail and Directory was in line with, if not slightly ahead of our 5-year average. The net effect of that was a gain in retail. However, the drop in retail stock was driven, in part, by a transfer from directory, being much lower than it was last year. Bought-in gross margin, so that -- did I lose you there a little bit? Don't worry. I'm going to - okay good. Bought-in gross margin, positive movement of 0.2%. This is all about currency. We costed a GBP 1.52. We actually bought the currency at GBP 1.54, so we made a very small currency gain. Achieved gross margin up 0.5%. Payroll, positive movement, 2 things going on here: First of all, better productivity in the stores, partly driven by increasing sales in existing stores which meant that our cover at the beginning and end of day, which is where we're at our least efficient, that we've got some productivity gains there, partly, because we reorganized our man-hour planning system. And those 2 effects offset the cost of living pay raise that we all awarded last October. That improvement in margin will reverse out by the end of the year to around flat because we increased our pay rates by around 6% in June. \r\nStore occupancy costs, big positive movement here. Rental inflation running at around 0.6%, rates at 2.5%, depreciation and one-off movements in occupancy costs, flat on last year. Warehouse, small gain in margin here. Again this is all about leverage over fixed overheads, so a big improvement in margin in the first half. We're not expecting for the same level of improvement in margin in the second half, it will be near a 1% rather than 2%. \r\nIn terms of Directory, revenue up 16%, in terms of the contribution to that growth, 2/3 of it -- of the growth coming from our U.K. business. U.K. business actually grew at slightly more than 10%, and we're at about 11%, 12%. Overseas, contributing 5.5% to the total sales growth of Directory. And I think what we're going to see over the next few years, is that as the U.K. business slows, we're hoping that the growth that we lose from that, as the business matures in the U.K., we will be able to make up for some of that through growing our overseas business. Active customers' up 9%, growth in cash customers, these are customers that come on to the website and pay with a credit card or debit card. That's where the main driver of U.K. growth is coming from. Credit customers down slightly, that's not because credit customers are giving up their accounts. It's because through the churn we're losing more customers -- credit customers than we're recruiting. Most of the new customers we're getting now are cash customers. \r\nProfit analysis. A drop in margin in direction. I'm just going to walk you through that. We're not -- we are expecting a drop in full-year margin for Directory but not as big as the one we've seen in the half year. Markdown, adverse movement here. The opposite effect to what happened in retail. In the full-price sales or markdown sales, the markdowns were slightly less than full-price, but stock for sale was much higher at 26%. So the clearance rates dropped and that meant that we had a bigger markdown charge. It wasn't actually the markdown charge it was more the obsolescence for the stock that we hadn't sold by the end of the season. And in fact, as the sale has progressed beyond the half year, looking at it, that number will probably nudge up to about 0.3%, because the clearance rates have been a bit disappointing since then. \r\nJust to give you a picture of what's happened to the total sale stock in the business. Full-price sales across Retail and Directory up 12%, stock for sale was up 8%, markdown sales were up 3%. So across the whole business, we've put less stock into the sale but our clearance rates were reduced. Overall, across retail and Directory the financial effect of that is broadly neutral. \r\n'14 gross margins in Directory, down 0.1%. Two things going on here. We get the same currency gain that we got in retail but it would've given us 0.2%, but price reductions in some of our overseas territories, we'll be making high profitability, and we took the opportunity to reduce margins to drive sales. And in some currencies, some countries where the currency moved heavily against us, we moved our prices up but not by quite enough to make up for the currency swing and that's pulled our margin down a bit. Achieved gross margin down 0.3%.\r\nInterest income. This is all about interest income. You remember from the credit sales, credit sales grew by 10%, so our credit is still growing but not by as much as sales. Adverse movement on marketing. This is all about direct mail costs. We started doing direct mail this time last year. Direct mail has not been a profitable form of recruitment for many years. Last year we started to do it again and got some positive response to it. That increased our marketing costs and also increases our U.K. sales but marketing costs went up us a percentage of sales. That process will annualize in autumn, winter so we're expecting that marketing, the adverse movement on marketing to reverse out in the second half. \r\nA similar story on creation and print. This is all about new publications. There were 2 publications that we published in the first half, new publications. The LABEL publication, and the autumn New In publication. Both of which were published in the first half but their sales will come through in the second half. So again we expect that margin, adverse margin movement to drop out in the second half. \r\nOverall, central overheads, leveraged or fixed overheads, gives us a 0.2% gain. \r\nFor the full year, in terms of Directory, we expect about half of the loss we've seen in the first half. \r\nMoving on to growth, a subject that we haven't really talked about for many years, sales growth, but a little bit of around it at the moment. I thought it'd be useful to break the sales growth down into its constituent's parts. So in terms of our total growth, there are 5 drivers; new space, existing stores, U.K. Directory, Directory overseas and brands. Retail contributed 4.7%, Directory contributed 6%. And then, of those, you can see that new space and existing store growth gave us about the same growth in sales, 2.5% each. U.K. Directory sales still the biggest driver of growth for the brand at 3.2%. Overseas, 2% of our growth. And brands, particularly, and part of that is this new label business that I'll talk a little bit more about later on, contributing 0.8%. \r\nWhat I'm going to do is just talk through some of the initiatives that have driven the different parts of the business. Space, we've actually lost stores in the first half, but put on about 100,000 square feet. Looking forward to the end of the year we're going to have very good visibility of what we will open. We expect stores to decline by 1%. A total square footage to go up in the order of 350,000 square feet. In terms of -- it's quite interesting, in terms of the average size of the shops that we're opening, the average size of the new stores are around 20,000 square feet, the average size of the ones we're closing are around 7,000 square feet. Please don't take that number and multiply it by the numbers on the left-hand side, because obviously the 21,000 is a gross number, not a net -- not a net increase. \r\nMore of our new spaces going to Home and Fashion, and we now have 25% of our total space given over to Home sales. That would account for around 16%, 17% of our retail sales. Large format stores. This is our store in York, and these are stores where we have a, what looks like a home stand-alone shop on one side, 2 floors, downstairs, going each on the ground floor, kitchen, et cetera. Upstairs, bedroom, furniture and bathroom. And on the other side, a traditional fashion store. What we've found is that, unsurprisingly, when we put the 2 together, each element does better than it would have done on its own. These new large format stores account for 70% of the new space that we'll be opening in the current year. \r\nThese are the ones that we've opened. We've opened 11, of which, 6 we've opened in the current year. Hedge End is an interesting new departure for us. This is a store that we -- for the first time, we actually built the shop ourselves. In terms of the economics of it, it's 58,000 square feet. We appraised the turnover at GBP 19.5 million, appraised profit of 3.5 -- around GBP 3.5 million. We did take a view on the payback here. We think this is a very long-term site, and to a degree, it's an experimental shop, so we took a view of a 35-month payback on the shop. For cost turnover it's actually slightly better, that will drop to around 30 months. We're hoping that in time, as we get used to building these shops we'll be able to get the payback back to our more normal 24 months. But we still think for a site that we're going to occupy for the next 20 years in a good location, the 30-month payback is acceptable. \r\nIn terms of new shops, we've got 10 planned, 26 under negotiation. Of those, 7 of them will be bespoke buildings. \r\nWe haven't forgotten about town centers. This is Skipton as was. This is our new superstore in Skipton. It's right on the High Street but on the edge of the High Street and there's a cut-through to the carpark. And these towns were a typical sort of expansion, old sales were GBP 1.4 million, new store sales GBP 3.5 million, and we're getting a good return from those. We do still have 25 proposals for existing towns and cities, some of them are large scale -- are large-scale developments. And I think it will be a mistake to think that the towns and cities of Great Britain were dead. There are some really good towns and cities, and the cities that have invested in better roads, better parking, and who are more ambitious in terms of what they're allowed to happen, prepared to let happen in their towns, those places, not only are they continuing to survive but actually in many cases, moving forward. \r\nIn terms of the performance of new space, obviously, underlying sales did really well this year so we beat out sales targets. 12%, we were 12% ahead of target, payback in 15 months. That's not because we've set our payback targets lower. If we hit our target, we would have done 22 months payback. \r\nStock profitability, still very healthy. This is the profit before any essential overheads, 24%. In terms of our existing stores, service has been our big drive this year. You remember this graph that I showed you which -- this was a survey that was done in June last year, where customers, this is independent research, customers were asked how they rated different retailers, service, and since you see it's quite a long way down the pack, with only 46% saying outstanding or very good. Since a year ago, we've changed our recruitment methods. We've changed our staff bonus scheme to make it purely gauge of service, we trained -- changed our training scheme, our appraisal system, our planning system, and we've improved our rates of pay. I mentioned the increase in rates of pay earlier, but that's not because we're having difficulty recruiting people, it's because we think that if we pay a little bit more, we will get the best people. And that's a part of improving our service. We just did the survey again, we've got the results of the survey again in June this year, we've gone up 56% and we're now sort of fourth in the pack of competitors on the High Street, still in my view not good enough, but we're making progress. \r\nTransitional stock has been another thing that has really helped our ranges succeed this year. You'll remember that we used to plan 2 seasons, spring/summer, autumn/winter, which meant that, particularly, in the first few phases of those seasons, our stock was often weather inappropriate. When people are buying closer and closer to the point at which they want to wear their clothing, it was becoming less and less productive. We divided our seasons now into 4 seasons. We're not allowed to talk about spring/summer season or autumn/winter season unless we're talking financial half year, but then I'd much rather be using the word half year around spring/summer, and so one of the -- it's amazing how effective that sort of -- the whole control of language thing has been. That's what our shop would have looked like this time last year, this is taken in our mock shop, and this is the same part of the shop this year. So a step-change in the transitional content of our ranges. It's very difficult to measure this, but when our buyers have been categorizing the stock, between transitional and nontraditional stock, we think we're taking around GBP 20 million more on transitional stock this year than last year. \r\nIn terms of Directory, a number of things going on here. The most important things is publications. In line with retail, we have changed the way that we -- buy for the seasons. Last -- in 2012, we would have 4 publications bought for our spring/summer season and autumn/winter season, the first book would've had a lot of the summer stock in it, and we only had 4 books. We trialed a number of smaller New In publications last year, and this year, we have rolled that out in earnest. So in terms of what the publication timetable looks like now, still the same 4 books to coincide with the launch of each season. \r\nAnd in addition to that, 4 New In brochures -- these brochures are around 150 to 250 pages. The 250 page limit is a postal limit, actually. If you've got over that level, and suddenly, you have to pay a fortune for that. We're looking at ways around that. Next year, we hope to be able to increase the size of these, most around 300 to 350. But what you can see is that every 6 weeks our Directory customers in line with our retail customers are getting an injection of new stock. There's obviously one gap that we've left in the middle there, and next year, we will fill that with a high summer New In brochure that will be for the stock that we launched in retail 6 weeks before the sale, but then carryover into autumn. \r\nIn terms of deliveries, we've made some progress here as well. By far, the most important thing has been the introduction of free Next data store delivery. That service covered stores which accounted for 72% of our sales in October. We sold the brochure over the last 2 -- or so over the last year, we've increased the coverage, and it's now running at -- at the moment, it's running at 94%. As a result of that, we have seen a dramatic increase in the percentage of customers who ordered from home, that had their stock to stores. So 52%. Just over half our orders are now being delivered to stores having been ordered at home. That's not as big a number as it looks, because the orders that go to store, because they have free delivery, and the customers don't want to pay money to have small deliveries sent to them, and actually, it still accounts for 30% of our sales, because these orders tend to be the smallest orders that go to store, it's efficient for the customer and it's obviously also efficient for us. \r\nWe'll be moving the cutoff for our store orders, from 10:00 p.m. to midnight in October. Actually, that service is up and running at the moment, but we're not marketing it until October. But if you go on the website during September, you should be able to order up to midnight for next-day delivery to store. \r\nDirectory overseas, a huge number of very small initiatives, new countries, local languages, new tender types, domestic currencies, these are the ones, these are the changes that we've made this year, the type face in black get the things we've already done, the red ones are changes to come. \r\nIn terms of our sales forecast for the full year, we expect the sales to go from GBP 100 million to around GBP 150 million for this year. What you can see is that the sterling increase we're forecasting is broadly the same as last year, but the percentage increase is much lower. And we think that it's very important not to do the sort of the old analyst trick of taking the 50% growth and compounding it for the next 20 years, and coming up with Amazon. We think that growth in percentage terms will moderate over the next 2 or 3 years, as the changes that we've made to the site in terms of currencies, languages, as those annualize. So you don't get too excited about these numbers. \r\nThe one area where we are uncompetitive overseas is on speed of delivery. Actually our pricing, we believe, in most countries where we're trading, we're delivering stock directly from the U.K. at prices that are competitive with the local market. But our speed of delivery is somewhere between 3, and 5 or 6 days and that is obviously something that our local operators can beat. We are doing a trial in Ireland where at the moment we deliver to Northern Ireland and Era from our trucking stock across -- from our warehouses each day. What that means is that in Northern Ireland, rather than having a 10 PM cutoff for next-day delivery, it's midday. And in Era, it's taking us 2 to 3 days to get the stock to our customers. We are building a small hub in Belfast. It's not huge expenditures, about GBP 1.1 million, and it's included in the CapEx numbers that I've given you already. GBP 1.1 million, that will be a mirror image of our warehouse in Yorkshire. In that, it will hold all the items that we expect to sell in Northern Ireland. Many of those items will only be holding 1 or 2 pieces that we stored as singles in a small warehouse. We will replenish that every day by truck to keep the -- those forward locations topped up with stock. And the stock the customer’s order, inevitably, the customers that order stock that isn't in that warehouse. We'll get it wrong on occasions. We think that the majority of those orders we will be able to fly and get into the warehouse before the parcel leaves the next day, on the majority of items. What that means is that we'll have 10:00 p.m. for Northern Ireland for the next-day delivery. We will also have 10:00 p.m. for next-day delivery in the Republic of Ireland. This operation is something of an experiment. So we're not worried about it. We don't think there's enormous risk. The risk, if you like, is on the cost and management side, rather than the service side. But there is a -- there are, there will be lots of things that we have to learn, not least, about the sort of volumes we need to hold in order to service the demand from these countries. Because it's close to home, because it's an English-speaking country, it's a good place to experiment. If that is successful, and once you've got all the operating systems sorted out, it's our intention to open an Eastern European hub sometime in 2015 stroke, '16. \r\nFinally, our brands business. Earlier on we were talking about Directory U.K., contributing around 3% growth to the company. Actually, Directory, the whole Directory business, including brands is nearer 4%, and we think the introduction of LABEL, which allows us to bring in brands that don't want to sit in for the Next Directory, gives us another opportunity of growth in the U.K. as our core Directory business matures. We did a trial, we printed 4,000 -- 400,000 books, and it was profitable. And interestingly, and actually, slightly, to our surprise, we saw no evidence of deflection amongst those people who we sent the LABEL brochure to. So we have succeeded, we think, in limiting the brand to noncompeting brands. \r\nTwo modes of operation: Wholesale and commission. The vast majority at the moment are on wholesale. We, over time, we anticipate that more and more retailers will work with us on a commission basis. We make less profit that way, but we think that it is -- the upside of that, is that our partners make more profit, and therefore, we think that will encourage them to give us better stock. \r\nIn terms of the advantages to our brand partners, obviously, we've got an access to the 4 million customer base of the Next Directory, many of whom are already buying their brands. But a lot of them don't live near a High Street that actually sell those brands. They've got the next-day delivery service, so it'd be exactly the same promise, 10 PM cutoff for next-day delivery, the stock can be delivered any one of our stores, for the 52% of our orders that we get from Home to Store. Obviously, we have a catalog production team and photography team, which enables us to put together, the brochure. And the other thing, that I think is important about this business is that it will have exactly the same approach to this to discounting as NEXT. So we will not discount any of the -- of our partners' products, or promote them, price promote them in season. And we think that, that actually -- brands who we're selling to lots of different people, that price integrity will become more and more important. \r\nIt will have its own labels and packaging. And at some point, we will introduce a dedicated sort of stand-alone website, but that's still under construction and in some way off. \r\nIn terms of total brands business, 77 -- we've grown the business from GBP 65 million to GBP 77 million and we estimate it will be in the order of GBP 110 million in the year ahead. The profitability is around 15%, so less than our core business, and that 15% exclude -- on the label profit, that 15% excludes the startup costs, and -- but it also excludes interest income as well. But it is a profitable business. \r\nIn terms of -- this is one of these slightly, airy fairy things that I can't put numbers on, so it will be of no interest to the analyst community. But in terms of what is driving the business, more than anything else, I think it is our -- the emphasis that we are putting as a business on design. We've -- over the last -- this is something that we've been working on, really, for 3 years, and it's this belief, that if we're at the top-end of the mass-market, ultimately, there are always going to be people to be able to sell clothes cheaper than us. And if we are going to succeed, it has to be through the design of our clothing. What we're attempting to do is that every point that we interact with our customers, we want to give them something that is well-designed, and whether that be the clothes that we design -- and we design all of our -- pretty much, all of our clothes, particularly, all of our clothing that we design in-house including the prints which we designed ourselves. Whether that be our shops, where we're beginning to change people's expectations. We've already, I think, changed people's expectations in terms of what they expect on the inside of our shop. But we are slowly, but surely, over the next 10 years, we want to change people's expectations, as to what they can see by way of architecture, particularly, in our out-of-town stores. And we're investing in that in the business. \r\nSo on the left-hand side this is our campus in -- campus is one a bit of a posh word actually. But you know what I mean, our offices in Leicester. This is a new design studio that we've built right in the middle of our campus. And again, it's sort of -- not only is it investing in design, but it's also the message to the rest of the business, is that design is literally at the heart of the business. \r\nIn terms of outlook, economic environment -- and in terms of economic environment we need to talk about the weather. Obviously retailers are allowed to talk about the weather as an excuse for good sales, never as an excuse for bad sales. But really, what I'm doing is, I'm getting excuses in early for next year in a not too subtle way. But what I would point out is that this is the average temperature this year. You can see that actually we have had a much, much better summer than last year, and that has definitely had an effect on our sales. And we can see on a week-by-week basis, when the sun comes out in the summer season, sales go up. That has been a factor. The rest of the economy, employment is still growing, credit is still flowing back into the economy, housing transactions are at very healthy levels, and that's good for our Home business. Real wages, although the gap is narrowing, and has narrowed from where it was in the middle of the credit crunch, but still, there is still a small gap. And I have to say, that is slightly at odds with our general experience and anecdotal evidence we're getting from how our customers are feeling. But the official figure still show a small, although much narrower gap in real earnings. And interest rates remain low. Think caveat, obviously, interest rates remaining low is good for NEXT, because we're at the top-end of the mass-market, which means, our customers have -- a lot of them have mortgages and we have a big tune in that business which means that a lot of our customers are at the peak of their mortgage cycle, obviously good news while they stay low, but health warning on that. Obviously, when they go up, NEXT is likely to be disproportionately affected by interest rate rises in the U.K. \r\nOutlook for sales, and really, this is just a repetition of what we said in our trading statement. But just to remind you, that's what our growth pattern looked like last year, 1% in the first quarter, 4%, 4% and then 11% in the fourth. In the first 2 quarters, we've grown 11%. The third quarter, we're expecting to be 10%, the fourth quarter, as we reach these very tough comparatives we're expecting that to be 4%. And after everything that we've seen this year so far, in terms of when we come up against the big weeks last year we are seeing an inverse effect. So we do believe that 4% figure. And to give you some comfort on the realism of it, the 2-year growth, if we look at the 2-year growth in quarter 1, quarter 2, 12%, 15%, this is this year's growth from 2 years ago, we're forecasting the same in quarter 3 and actually slightly more in quarter 4. If we achieve our sales range of between 7% and 10% we expect profits to rise somewhere between 11% and 17%. Earnings per share to rise more than that as a result of buybacks, 13% to 19%. Total shareholder return, which in our lingo is earnings per share, plus dividend yield, we expect to be somewhere between 17% and 23%. And just to remind you of the graph that we first put up 5 years ago, in terms of our target range of return, dividends, plus earnings per share, somewhere between 9% and 15%, that's what we've achieved in the past. Last year, it boosted by a big tax gain. This year, we're expecting 17% -- between 17% at the worst case, 23% at the best case.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: R. Barton (Executives)】\nWe're ready to start. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our 6-month's results. We've had a good first 6 months to the 2014-15 year, sales up 10%, profits up 19%, earnings per share up 20%. In the paper, there are various reasons given why we think we've done well, but I think, actually, probably the biggest ones is, there's some evidence that the U.K. economy now has turned the corner, and we are some real growth come through. \r\nOur strategy in NEXT is fairly straightforward, and I'll reiterate it for you. Again, it's improving and then developing our products, expanding and upgrading our retail estate, developing our Directory customer base and, of course, returning cash to our shareholders. Since I became Chairman 8 years ago, that strategy has remained unchanged. It's held us in good stand, it's not likely to change going forward. Looking ahead, we've given some pretty clear indicators of growth in the statement, 10% in this quarter, and 4% in the last quarter of the year. If we achieve that, we would have a good year. Simon?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Simon Wolfson (Executives)】\nThank you very much. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for making the effort to be here, now I know you've got far more -- many other more important retailers to talk to this morning. Thank you also, I don't know if you got caught in the queue coming in. But a little [indiscernible] thing going on, getting into the UBS this morning, which I've got caught up in myself. There we are, right. The first half of the year, good first half, sales up 10%, profit up 19%. In terms of that -- the difference in sales growth and profit growth, is not quite as big a gap as it looks, full price sales up 11.5%, of the 19%, 2% of it comes off from a swing in the valuation of currency instruments at the half year, there was a GBP 6 million swing in this valuation, that takes it down to around 17%. Ground grew at 16%, most of the margin gain, by far, the biggest elements of the margin gain has come from growth in our existing store sales. \r\nInterests, up on last year, this is all about the issuing of a bond, our underlying interest rates remain broadly flat. We have about -- we have growth debts around GBP 160 million more than last year. Taxation, 20.5%. Last year in the first half, 20%, but for the full year last year, 20.5%, we're expecting the full year of 20.5% this year, the profit after tax up 18.6%. Earnings per share, expected to be up 22%. This is a combined effect of last year's buybacks in the second half and this year's buybacks. Ordinary dividend, increasing from 36p to 50p, that's a very big percentage increase, but the percentage increase in the half-year dividend is really about rebalancing our dividend, and getting it back to where we wanted it to be, which is 1/3 at the half-year, 2/3 at the end. We are forecasting estimates of 150p dividend for the full year, up 16.5%, in line with the central forecast for earnings per share that we've given for our profits. \r\nMoving on to cash flow. Capital expenditure, this is just a reminder of last year's CapEx of GBP 105 million, pretty much the same amount on new space, of GBP 71 million, and we'll open around the same amount of that space this year as last year. GBP 12 million on what we -- maintenance CapEx, this is CapEx that just so -- that keeps the stores looking nice, we don't get a return on it. At the beginning of the year, we estimated that number was going to be GBP 5 million or GBP 6 million having taken a look at our whole portfolio, in particular, the stores, whose assets have depreciated to 0, where we have more than 3 or 4 years left on the lease. We've looked at those stores and decided to spend a little bit of money getting then back in better shape. GBP 34 million on other. I spent some time explaining this at the full year results, 6 months ago, so I'm just going to bring it up as a reminder how that breaks down. The only number that's changed on here since the beginning of the year is the warehouse number. The warehouse number was near GBP 17 million, and it's about, it's GBP 12 million now. The difference is that, at the beginning of the year, actually, it's about GBP 6 million higher. The difference is that at the beginning of the year, we thought we were going to buy the land for our new furniture warehouse, as it is, we're going to lease it, so that comes out of CapEx, but will obviously be a -- there'll be a rental costs there at some point in the future. \r\nIn terms of operating cash flow, GBP 200 million this year in the first half, as against GBP 130 million, GBP 129 million last year. This is the cash flow before special dividends and buybacks. The increase of GBP 70 million is mainly driven by the profit growth at the top, but also, there's a change in the ESOT number. Last year, we were continuing to increase the percentage of the options in outstanding, that we cover in our ESOT. And that meant, we spent GBP 30 million more increasing the cover, that's a permanent reduction in share capital if we keep the ESOT topped up. And so it's -- about GBP 30 million of that is really a buyback in disguise. \r\nIn terms of special dividends, 2 special dividends in the first half, are share buybacks of GBP 105 million. \r\nMoving onto the balance sheet. Assets down 4%, fixed assets down 4%, this is all about depreciation, and running slightly ahead of CapEx. Stock up 15%. Of that stock increase, around 10% is because we expected our sales to be up 10%. The balance is really a timing issue in terms of the stock that was bought in. We bought in stock a little bit earlier for the launch of our autumn season, and our sale was a week later, which meant that at this point in time, we had a little bit more sales stock in the business, that figure has now fallen back to being near in line with sales. \r\nDebtors, up 9%, and that is driven by, mainly by Directory debtors, up 11%, and that, is driven by credit sales, which are up 10%. The increase in credit sales is not because it increased our credit customers, actually, our credit customers have declined in number, and this is about credit customers spending more with us on their account, partly as a result of increasing credit limits for the very best of our customer base, best credit risk that is. And partly, as a result of increased use of our directory account in-store. \r\nNet debt at the half year, GBP 571 million. Just looking forward to the cash flow to the end of the year, we started the year with GBP 517 million of net debt, and we expect to generate around GBP 330 million of operational cash flow, after ordinary dividends, CapEx, interests, et cetera. Off that, we'll, we'd have already spent GBP 223 million in special dividends, 2 in the first half and 1 in August. And on top of that, GBP 105 million of share buybacks, which will take us back to pretty much where we started in terms of debt. You'll notice that our net debt figure for the business is pretty much similar to what it's been for the last 5 or 6 years, and obviously, as our profits have grown, some of you might remark that we could afford to increase our debt in terms of -- and our balance sheet is beginning to look less efficient, and that will be a correct observation. However, we are -- beyond the upper price limit of our share buyback limit, and the time to extend that debt is when we can retire equity, we wouldn't increase debt in order to pay special dividends, that doesn't seem a sensible thing to do. \r\nRetail is the -- the detail of the retail accounts, revenue up 7.5%, 3.8% growth from net space. Increase in space in terms of the percentage increase in the square footage was 4.4%, you'll notice that that is a much higher return on the square footage. We would normally expect to around a 65% return, that's a -- pretty much for the last 10 years the average will be around 60%, between 60% and 65%. The reason for that is just the small number of very high density big shops we've owned: Camberley, Northampton and Braehead Glasgow, be 3 of the -- are the 3 stores that have driven that the most. In terms of profit, profit margins, moving forward significantly in retail, marked down a positive movement, 0.3. Two opposing things going on here: First of all, the good news is, we had less stock to go, into the sale and full-price sales round ahead of marked down sales. The bad news is, we had only 1% less stock, but 4% lower markdown sales. We think that's partly because we delayed the sale a week. Every 6 years we have to push it back a week as it comes to, ticks forward, looking partly, there's an effect there. Partly, it's a return to more normal levels of clearance. The clearance rate we achieved in both Retail and Directory was in line with, if not slightly ahead of our 5-year average. The net effect of that was a gain in retail. However, the drop in retail stock was driven, in part, by a transfer from directory, being much lower than it was last year. Bought-in gross margin, so that -- did I lose you there a little bit? Don't worry. I'm going to - okay good. Bought-in gross margin, positive movement of 0.2%. This is all about currency. We costed a GBP 1.52. We actually bought the currency at GBP 1.54, so we made a very small currency gain. Achieved gross margin up 0.5%. Payroll, positive movement, 2 things going on here: First of all, better productivity in the stores, partly driven by increasing sales in existing stores which meant that our cover at the beginning and end of day, which is where we're at our least efficient, that we've got some productivity gains there, partly, because we reorganized our man-hour planning system. And those 2 effects offset the cost of living pay raise that we all awarded last October. That improvement in margin will reverse out by the end of the year to around flat because we increased our pay rates by around 6% in June. \r\nStore occupancy costs, big positive movement here. Rental inflation running at around 0.6%, rates at 2.5%, depreciation and one-off movements in occupancy costs, flat on last year. Warehouse, small gain in margin here. Again this is all about leverage over fixed overheads, so a big improvement in margin in the first half. We're not expecting for the same level of improvement in margin in the second half, it will be near a 1% rather than 2%. \r\nIn terms of Directory, revenue up 16%, in terms of the contribution to that growth, 2/3 of it -- of the growth coming from our U.K. business. U.K. business actually grew at slightly more than 10%, and we're at about 11%, 12%. Overseas, contributing 5.5% to the total sales growth of Directory. And I think what we're going to see over the next few years, is that as the U.K. business slows, we're hoping that the growth that we lose from that, as the business matures in the U.K., we will be able to make up for some of that through growing our overseas business. Active customers' up 9%, growth in cash customers, these are customers that come on to the website and pay with a credit card or debit card. That's where the main driver of U.K. growth is coming from. Credit customers down slightly, that's not because credit customers are giving up their accounts. It's because through the churn we're losing more customers -- credit customers than we're recruiting. Most of the new customers we're getting now are cash customers. \r\nProfit analysis. A drop in margin in direction. I'm just going to walk you through that. We're not -- we are expecting a drop in full-year margin for Directory but not as big as the one we've seen in the half year. Markdown, adverse movement here. The opposite effect to what happened in retail. In the full-price sales or markdown sales, the markdowns were slightly less than full-price, but stock for sale was much higher at 26%. So the clearance rates dropped and that meant that we had a bigger markdown charge. It wasn't actually the markdown charge it was more the obsolescence for the stock that we hadn't sold by the end of the season. And in fact, as the sale has progressed beyond the half year, looking at it, that number will probably nudge up to about 0.3%, because the clearance rates have been a bit disappointing since then. \r\nJust to give you a picture of what's happened to the total sale stock in the business. Full-price sales across Retail and Directory up 12%, stock for sale was up 8%, markdown sales were up 3%. So across the whole business, we've put less stock into the sale but our clearance rates were reduced. Overall, across retail and Directory the financial effect of that is broadly neutral. \r\n'14 gross margins in Directory, down 0.1%. Two things going on here. We get the same currency gain that we got in retail but it would've given us 0.2%, but price reductions in some of our overseas territories, we'll be making high profitability, and we took the opportunity to reduce margins to drive sales. And in some currencies, some countries where the currency moved heavily against us, we moved our prices up but not by quite enough to make up for the currency swing and that's pulled our margin down a bit. Achieved gross margin down 0.3%.\r\nInterest income. This is all about interest income. You remember from the credit sales, credit sales grew by 10%, so our credit is still growing but not by as much as sales. Adverse movement on marketing. This is all about direct mail costs. We started doing direct mail this time last year. Direct mail has not been a profitable form of recruitment for many years. Last year we started to do it again and got some positive response to it. That increased our marketing costs and also increases our U.K. sales but marketing costs went up us a percentage of sales. That process will annualize in autumn, winter so we're expecting that marketing, the adverse movement on marketing to reverse out in the second half. \r\nA similar story on creation and print. This is all about new publications. There were 2 publications that we published in the first half, new publications. The LABEL publication, and the autumn New In publication. Both of which were published in the first half but their sales will come through in the second half. So again we expect that margin, adverse margin movement to drop out in the second half. \r\nOverall, central overheads, leveraged or fixed overheads, gives us a 0.2% gain. \r\nFor the full year, in terms of Directory, we expect about half of the loss we've seen in the first half. \r\nMoving on to growth, a subject that we haven't really talked about for many years, sales growth, but a little bit of around it at the moment. I thought it'd be useful to break the sales growth down into its constituent's parts. So in terms of our total growth, there are 5 drivers; new space, existing stores, U.K. Directory, Directory overseas and brands. Retail contributed 4.7%, Directory contributed 6%. And then, of those, you can see that new space and existing store growth gave us about the same growth in sales, 2.5% each. U.K. Directory sales still the biggest driver of growth for the brand at 3.2%. Overseas, 2% of our growth. And brands, particularly, and part of that is this new label business that I'll talk a little bit more about later on, contributing 0.8%. \r\nWhat I'm going to do is just talk through some of the initiatives that have driven the different parts of the business. Space, we've actually lost stores in the first half, but put on about 100,000 square feet. Looking forward to the end of the year we're going to have very good visibility of what we will open. We expect stores to decline by 1%. A total square footage to go up in the order of 350,000 square feet. In terms of -- it's quite interesting, in terms of the average size of the shops that we're opening, the average size of the new stores are around 20,000 square feet, the average size of the ones we're closing are around 7,000 square feet. Please don't take that number and multiply it by the numbers on the left-hand side, because obviously the 21,000 is a gross number, not a net -- not a net increase. \r\nMore of our new spaces going to Home and Fashion, and we now have 25% of our total space given over to Home sales. That would account for around 16%, 17% of our retail sales. Large format stores. This is our store in York, and these are stores where we have a, what looks like a home stand-alone shop on one side, 2 floors, downstairs, going each on the ground floor, kitchen, et cetera. Upstairs, bedroom, furniture and bathroom. And on the other side, a traditional fashion store. What we've found is that, unsurprisingly, when we put the 2 together, each element does better than it would have done on its own. These new large format stores account for 70% of the new space that we'll be opening in the current year. \r\nThese are the ones that we've opened. We've opened 11, of which, 6 we've opened in the current year. Hedge End is an interesting new departure for us. This is a store that we -- for the first time, we actually built the shop ourselves. In terms of the economics of it, it's 58,000 square feet. We appraised the turnover at GBP 19.5 million, appraised profit of 3.5 -- around GBP 3.5 million. We did take a view on the payback here. We think this is a very long-term site, and to a degree, it's an experimental shop, so we took a view of a 35-month payback on the shop. For cost turnover it's actually slightly better, that will drop to around 30 months. We're hoping that in time, as we get used to building these shops we'll be able to get the payback back to our more normal 24 months. But we still think for a site that we're going to occupy for the next 20 years in a good location, the 30-month payback is acceptable. \r\nIn terms of new shops, we've got 10 planned, 26 under negotiation. Of those, 7 of them will be bespoke buildings. \r\nWe haven't forgotten about town centers. This is Skipton as was. This is our new superstore in Skipton. It's right on the High Street but on the edge of the High Street and there's a cut-through to the carpark. And these towns were a typical sort of expansion, old sales were GBP 1.4 million, new store sales GBP 3.5 million, and we're getting a good return from those. We do still have 25 proposals for existing towns and cities, some of them are large scale -- are large-scale developments. And I think it will be a mistake to think that the towns and cities of Great Britain were dead. There are some really good towns and cities, and the cities that have invested in better roads, better parking, and who are more ambitious in terms of what they're allowed to happen, prepared to let happen in their towns, those places, not only are they continuing to survive but actually in many cases, moving forward. \r\nIn terms of the performance of new space, obviously, underlying sales did really well this year so we beat out sales targets. 12%, we were 12% ahead of target, payback in 15 months. That's not because we've set our payback targets lower. If we hit our target, we would have done 22 months payback. \r\nStock profitability, still very healthy. This is the profit before any essential overheads, 24%. In terms of our existing stores, service has been our big drive this year. You remember this graph that I showed you which -- this was a survey that was done in June last year, where customers, this is independent research, customers were asked how they rated different retailers, service, and since you see it's quite a long way down the pack, with only 46% saying outstanding or very good. Since a year ago, we've changed our recruitment methods. We've changed our staff bonus scheme to make it purely gauge of service, we trained -- changed our training scheme, our appraisal system, our planning system, and we've improved our rates of pay. I mentioned the increase in rates of pay earlier, but that's not because we're having difficulty recruiting people, it's because we think that if we pay a little bit more, we will get the best people. And that's a part of improving our service. We just did the survey again, we've got the results of the survey again in June this year, we've gone up 56% and we're now sort of fourth in the pack of competitors on the High Street, still in my view not good enough, but we're making progress. \r\nTransitional stock has been another thing that has really helped our ranges succeed this year. You'll remember that we used to plan 2 seasons, spring/summer, autumn/winter, which meant that, particularly, in the first few phases of those seasons, our stock was often weather inappropriate. When people are buying closer and closer to the point at which they want to wear their clothing, it was becoming less and less productive. We divided our seasons now into 4 seasons. We're not allowed to talk about spring/summer season or autumn/winter season unless we're talking financial half year, but then I'd much rather be using the word half year around spring/summer, and so one of the -- it's amazing how effective that sort of -- the whole control of language thing has been. That's what our shop would have looked like this time last year, this is taken in our mock shop, and this is the same part of the shop this year. So a step-change in the transitional content of our ranges. It's very difficult to measure this, but when our buyers have been categorizing the stock, between transitional and nontraditional stock, we think we're taking around GBP 20 million more on transitional stock this year than last year. \r\nIn terms of Directory, a number of things going on here. The most important things is publications. In line with retail, we have changed the way that we -- buy for the seasons. Last -- in 2012, we would have 4 publications bought for our spring/summer season and autumn/winter season, the first book would've had a lot of the summer stock in it, and we only had 4 books. We trialed a number of smaller New In publications last year, and this year, we have rolled that out in earnest. So in terms of what the publication timetable looks like now, still the same 4 books to coincide with the launch of each season. \r\nAnd in addition to that, 4 New In brochures -- these brochures are around 150 to 250 pages. The 250 page limit is a postal limit, actually. If you've got over that level, and suddenly, you have to pay a fortune for that. We're looking at ways around that. Next year, we hope to be able to increase the size of these, most around 300 to 350. But what you can see is that every 6 weeks our Directory customers in line with our retail customers are getting an injection of new stock. There's obviously one gap that we've left in the middle there, and next year, we will fill that with a high summer New In brochure that will be for the stock that we launched in retail 6 weeks before the sale, but then carryover into autumn. \r\nIn terms of deliveries, we've made some progress here as well. By far, the most important thing has been the introduction of free Next data store delivery. That service covered stores which accounted for 72% of our sales in October. We sold the brochure over the last 2 -- or so over the last year, we've increased the coverage, and it's now running at -- at the moment, it's running at 94%. As a result of that, we have seen a dramatic increase in the percentage of customers who ordered from home, that had their stock to stores. So 52%. Just over half our orders are now being delivered to stores having been ordered at home. That's not as big a number as it looks, because the orders that go to store, because they have free delivery, and the customers don't want to pay money to have small deliveries sent to them, and actually, it still accounts for 30% of our sales, because these orders tend to be the smallest orders that go to store, it's efficient for the customer and it's obviously also efficient for us. \r\nWe'll be moving the cutoff for our store orders, from 10:00 p.m. to midnight in October. Actually, that service is up and running at the moment, but we're not marketing it until October. But if you go on the website during September, you should be able to order up to midnight for next-day delivery to store. \r\nDirectory overseas, a huge number of very small initiatives, new countries, local languages, new tender types, domestic currencies, these are the ones, these are the changes that we've made this year, the type face in black get the things we've already done, the red ones are changes to come. \r\nIn terms of our sales forecast for the full year, we expect the sales to go from GBP 100 million to around GBP 150 million for this year. What you can see is that the sterling increase we're forecasting is broadly the same as last year, but the percentage increase is much lower. And we think that it's very important not to do the sort of the old analyst trick of taking the 50% growth and compounding it for the next 20 years, and coming up with Amazon. We think that growth in percentage terms will moderate over the next 2 or 3 years, as the changes that we've made to the site in terms of currencies, languages, as those annualize. So you don't get too excited about these numbers. \r\nThe one area where we are uncompetitive overseas is on speed of delivery. Actually our pricing, we believe, in most countries where we're trading, we're delivering stock directly from the U.K. at prices that are competitive with the local market. But our speed of delivery is somewhere between 3, and 5 or 6 days and that is obviously something that our local operators can beat. We are doing a trial in Ireland where at the moment we deliver to Northern Ireland and Era from our trucking stock across -- from our warehouses each day. What that means is that in Northern Ireland, rather than having a 10 PM cutoff for next-day delivery, it's midday. And in Era, it's taking us 2 to 3 days to get the stock to our customers. We are building a small hub in Belfast. It's not huge expenditures, about GBP 1.1 million, and it's included in the CapEx numbers that I've given you already. GBP 1.1 million, that will be a mirror image of our warehouse in Yorkshire. In that, it will hold all the items that we expect to sell in Northern Ireland. Many of those items will only be holding 1 or 2 pieces that we stored as singles in a small warehouse. We will replenish that every day by truck to keep the -- those forward locations topped up with stock. And the stock the customer’s order, inevitably, the customers that order stock that isn't in that warehouse. We'll get it wrong on occasions. We think that the majority of those orders we will be able to fly and get into the warehouse before the parcel leaves the next day, on the majority of items. What that means is that we'll have 10:00 p.m. for Northern Ireland for the next-day delivery. We will also have 10:00 p.m. for next-day delivery in the Republic of Ireland. This operation is something of an experiment. So we're not worried about it. We don't think there's enormous risk. The risk, if you like, is on the cost and management side, rather than the service side. But there is a -- there are, there will be lots of things that we have to learn, not least, about the sort of volumes we need to hold in order to service the demand from these countries. Because it's close to home, because it's an English-speaking country, it's a good place to experiment. If that is successful, and once you've got all the operating systems sorted out, it's our intention to open an Eastern European hub sometime in 2015 stroke, '16. \r\nFinally, our brands business. Earlier on we were talking about Directory U.K., contributing around 3% growth to the company. Actually, Directory, the whole Directory business, including brands is nearer 4%, and we think the introduction of LABEL, which allows us to bring in brands that don't want to sit in for the Next Directory, gives us another opportunity of growth in the U.K. as our core Directory business matures. We did a trial, we printed 4,000 -- 400,000 books, and it was profitable. And interestingly, and actually, slightly, to our surprise, we saw no evidence of deflection amongst those people who we sent the LABEL brochure to. So we have succeeded, we think, in limiting the brand to noncompeting brands. \r\nTwo modes of operation: Wholesale and commission. The vast majority at the moment are on wholesale. We, over time, we anticipate that more and more retailers will work with us on a commission basis. We make less profit that way, but we think that it is -- the upside of that, is that our partners make more profit, and therefore, we think that will encourage them to give us better stock. \r\nIn terms of the advantages to our brand partners, obviously, we've got an access to the 4 million customer base of the Next Directory, many of whom are already buying their brands. But a lot of them don't live near a High Street that actually sell those brands. They've got the next-day delivery service, so it'd be exactly the same promise, 10 PM cutoff for next-day delivery, the stock can be delivered any one of our stores, for the 52% of our orders that we get from Home to Store. Obviously, we have a catalog production team and photography team, which enables us to put together, the brochure. And the other thing, that I think is important about this business is that it will have exactly the same approach to this to discounting as NEXT. So we will not discount any of the -- of our partners' products, or promote them, price promote them in season. And we think that, that actually -- brands who we're selling to lots of different people, that price integrity will become more and more important. \r\nIt will have its own labels and packaging. And at some point, we will introduce a dedicated sort of stand-alone website, but that's still under construction and in some way off. \r\nIn terms of total brands business, 77 -- we've grown the business from GBP 65 million to GBP 77 million and we estimate it will be in the order of GBP 110 million in the year ahead. The profitability is around 15%, so less than our core business, and that 15% exclude -- on the label profit, that 15% excludes the startup costs, and -- but it also excludes interest income as well. But it is a profitable business. \r\nIn terms of -- this is one of these slightly, airy fairy things that I can't put numbers on, so it will be of no interest to the analyst community. But in terms of what is driving the business, more than anything else, I think it is our -- the emphasis that we are putting as a business on design. We've -- over the last -- this is something that we've been working on, really, for 3 years, and it's this belief, that if we're at the top-end of the mass-market, ultimately, there are always going to be people to be able to sell clothes cheaper than us. And if we are going to succeed, it has to be through the design of our clothing. What we're attempting to do is that every point that we interact with our customers, we want to give them something that is well-designed, and whether that be the clothes that we design -- and we design all of our -- pretty much, all of our clothes, particularly, all of our clothing that we design in-house including the prints which we designed ourselves. Whether that be our shops, where we're beginning to change people's expectations. We've already, I think, changed people's expectations in terms of what they expect on the inside of our shop. But we are slowly, but surely, over the next 10 years, we want to change people's expectations, as to what they can see by way of architecture, particularly, in our out-of-town stores. And we're investing in that in the business. \r\nSo on the left-hand side this is our campus in -- campus is one a bit of a posh word actually. But you know what I mean, our offices in Leicester. This is a new design studio that we've built right in the middle of our campus. And again, it's sort of -- not only is it investing in design, but it's also the message to the rest of the business, is that design is literally at the heart of the business. \r\nIn terms of outlook, economic environment -- and in terms of economic environment we need to talk about the weather. Obviously retailers are allowed to talk about the weather as an excuse for good sales, never as an excuse for bad sales. But really, what I'm doing is, I'm getting excuses in early for next year in a not too subtle way. But what I would point out is that this is the average temperature this year. You can see that actually we have had a much, much better summer than last year, and that has definitely had an effect on our sales. And we can see on a week-by-week basis, when the sun comes out in the summer season, sales go up. That has been a factor. The rest of the economy, employment is still growing, credit is still flowing back into the economy, housing transactions are at very healthy levels, and that's good for our Home business. Real wages, although the gap is narrowing, and has narrowed from where it was in the middle of the credit crunch, but still, there is still a small gap. And I have to say, that is slightly at odds with our general experience and anecdotal evidence we're getting from how our customers are feeling. But the official figure still show a small, although much narrower gap in real earnings. And interest rates remain low. Think caveat, obviously, interest rates remaining low is good for NEXT, because we're at the top-end of the mass-market, which means, our customers have -- a lot of them have mortgages and we have a big tune in that business which means that a lot of our customers are at the peak of their mortgage cycle, obviously good news while they stay low, but health warning on that. Obviously, when they go up, NEXT is likely to be disproportionately affected by interest rate rises in the U.K. \r\nOutlook for sales, and really, this is just a repetition of what we said in our trading statement. But just to remind you, that's what our growth pattern looked like last year, 1% in the first quarter, 4%, 4% and then 11% in the fourth. In the first 2 quarters, we've grown 11%. The third quarter, we're expecting to be 10%, the fourth quarter, as we reach these very tough comparatives we're expecting that to be 4%. And after everything that we've seen this year so far, in terms of when we come up against the big weeks last year we are seeing an inverse effect. So we do believe that 4% figure. And to give you some comfort on the realism of it, the 2-year growth, if we look at the 2-year growth in quarter 1, quarter 2, 12%, 15%, this is this year's growth from 2 years ago, we're forecasting the same in quarter 3 and actually slightly more in quarter 4. If we achieve our sales range of between 7% and 10% we expect profits to rise somewhere between 11% and 17%. Earnings per share to rise more than that as a result of buybacks, 13% to 19%. Total shareholder return, which in our lingo is earnings per share, plus dividend yield, we expect to be somewhere between 17% and 23%. And just to remind you of the graph that we first put up 5 years ago, in terms of our target range of return, dividends, plus earnings per share, somewhere between 9% and 15%, that's what we've achieved in the past. Last year, it boosted by a big tax gain. This year, we're expecting 17% -- between 17% at the worst case, 23% at the best case.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you. Welcome, everyone, to this telephone conference on the occasion of H&M's 9-month results 2014. Our CFO, Jyrki Tervonen is with me, and we'll be happy to answer your questions after the presentation. You'll find the presentation slides to this telephone conference on hm.com.\r\nPlease look at the slide, Third Quarter 2014. It was a very strong quarter, both in terms of sales and profits. We continued gaining market share with very well-received collections and we continued our global expansion, with new stores as well as new large online markets. \r\nH&M Group's sales increased 21% in SEK and 16% in local currencies. Sales were strong for all group brands: H&M, COS, & Other Stories, Monki, Weekday and Cheap Monday. We see this performance as a receipt that customers appreciate our collections. \r\nGross profit in the third quarter increased 20% to SEK 23 billion, corresponding to a gross margin of 58.3% compared to 58.8% a year ago. \r\nLooking at the market situation for some external factors, such as raw material prices, cost inflation, supplier capacity, purchasing currencies and transportation costs, combined market situation for these factors was slightly negative compared to the corresponding purchasing period the year before, mainly as a result of increased cost inflation. \r\nLooking at the purchasing period for the fourth quarter, the combined market situation for the external factors is also expected to be slightly negative. \r\nThe summer months in fashion retail are generally characterized by clearance sales to make room for incoming autumn collections. This year, markdowns in relation to sales are marginally higher than in Q3 2013. \r\nCost control in the group remains very good. Costs in comparable stores were higher in absolute terms than last year but, as a share of sales, costs in comparable stores were lower. \r\nSG&A increased by 16% in local currencies and translating to SEK, the increase was 20% to SEK 15.7 billion. The increase is mainly related to our expansion, with costs for new stores and to our long-term investments. \r\nPlease turn to the slide, Long-Term Investments. We have continued our substantial long-term investments in IT and online, but also in the broadening of the product range and in our new brands. These are investments that we see as very important for H&M's future success. They cost a lot now, but will be very important for H&M for many years to come. The long-term investments are aimed at further strengthening H&M's market position and securing future expansion. \r\nOnline expansion has been rapid this year, with 4 new markets: France in March; followed by Italy and Spain in August; and China now in September, which was even a little earlier than planned. We are happy to see that customer reception has been very good in all these markets. \r\nNext year, we will launch H&M Shop Online in another 8 to 10 new markets. Long-term investments increased in the third quarter compared to the third quarter last year. In the third quarter this year, the long-term investments had a greater impact on results than in Q2 this year. \r\nCompared to Q3 2013, the effect in Q3 this year was slightly more than 30 basis points higher on the gross margin as well as on SG&A. So in total, a negative effect of approximately 65 basis points. \r\nTo look at profitability in the quarter, please return to the slide, Third Quarter 2014. Operating profit increased by 20% to SEK 6.9 billion, and the operating margin was 17.7% compared to 18% in the third quarter last year. \r\nProfit after financial items also increased by 20% to SEK 7 billion in the quarter. And after a tax rate of 24%, net profit increased to SEK 5.3 billion, equaling earnings per share of SEK 3.20, up from SEK 2.68. \r\nAnd now for some key figures, please turn to the slide, Key Data. Stock-in-trade, as of the 31st of August, amounted to SEK 17.9 billion, an increase of 17% in SEK and 15% in local currencies. The increase is mainly explained by the expansion in stores and online. The level and the composition of the stock-in-trade are considered good. \r\nCash flow from current operations was SEK 18 billion. The investments, in terms of CapEx, totaled SEK 6.3 billion. We invested mainly in new stores, but also in rebuilds and IT. \r\nThe financial position of the group remained strong. Liquid funds amounted to SEK 13.5 billion, and return on equity was 46.1% rolling 12 months compared to 43.4% last year. \r\nAnd now some words on our store expansion. Please turn to the next slide. We continue our strong store expansion. In the third quarter, we opened 56 new stores net and, as of the 31st of August, we have 3,341 stores in 54 markets. \r\nChina and the U.S. remain the largest expansion markets. In July, we opened a new flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York, which you can see on the next slide. Customer reception has been very good. It is H&M's 13th store on Manhattan, and we have 334 stores in the U.S. today. \r\nFor the full year 2014, we maintain our plan to open around 375 new stores net, within our expansion target of increasing the number of stores by 10% to 15% per year. \r\nThe Philippines will become a new market for H&M in October, with a flagship store in the SM Megamall in Manila. We see this -- we see great anticipation ahead of the opening, and plan to open more stores in Manila already this year. \r\nWe're also looking forward to opening H&M in India. The opening in India, which was planned for late this year, has been moved to 2015. Next year, we will also open the first H&M stores in South Africa, Peru, Taiwan and Macau. \r\nExpansion continues for the newer brands of the group as well, and we're also continuing to broaden our offering within H&M. One example is our new extended sports concept. Please turn to the slide, H&M Sport. \r\nWe're offering the new H&M Sport online at hm.com as well as in stores in selected markets. \r\nH&M Sport has enjoyed a very good start. We're developing the collections, and we see that our customers appreciate it. So we are ready for the next step to gradually expand the new H&M Sport to more stores and markets. \r\nAnother example is our extended shoe range. Please turn to the slide, H&M Shoes. This autumn, H&M is launching an extended shoe range for women, men, teenagers and children. Like the Sport concept, H&M's extended shoe collections are available online and in selected stores. The launch is still at an early stage, but customer reception, so far, has been very good. \r\nAnd now before we move on to the Q&A session, some words on current trading. In September, sales in local currencies have increased 7% from the first to the 23rd compared with the same period last year. \r\nLooking at trading this time of the year, August, September and October should be viewed together, as the beginning of autumn can vary a lot between the years. This year, sales in the second half of August were helped by cooler weather, while sales in September, so far, have been affected by unusually warm weather in most of our markets. The weather effect in September is clearly reflected in available external market data like, for example, from Germany. But we have an exciting autumn ahead of us. \r\nPlease turn to the next slide. Already next week, H&M is launching a collection that we are very proud of, H&M Conscious Denim. It is a denim collection that is made of more sustainable materials, such as organic cotton, recycled cotton and Tencel. Two of the pieces also include recycled fibers from clothes that we have collected under H&M's global Garment Collecting initiative. So far, customers have handed in more than 8,000 tons of used garments for reuse or recycling. Garment Collection is part of our work to close the loop for materials. It is one of the many initiatives that we invest in for a more sustainable future. \r\nAnd with that, we are now happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions]",

      "transcript_text3": "I was just wondering, on the online, given that you said China was launched a little earlier than expected, what is the potential to accelerate the opening for the coming 8 to 10 markets?\n\n---\n\nDon't get too carried away now. We -- there's intense work going on for the preparation for the 8 to 10 new markets, and we will come back to you in due time when they will open. But it's -- I want to remind you again, it's a lot of work and we invest a lot on this but, of course, it's in our own interest.\n\n---\n\nCan I just follow up on that? Could you just tell us a little how the work on the standardized online platform is going?\n\n---\n\nIt's going very well. As you can see, we've now launched 4 new markets within a very short time. So of course, that's boding well for the future.\n\n---\n\nCedric Lecasble from Raymond James. I have a question on FX. The impact -- the potential impact on sourcing COS. How are you dealing today with rapidly evolving FX, and USD in particular? And what kind of impact could you expect beyond next quarter? Do you think it could change, put a little more pressure on your gross margin?\n\n---\n\nAgain, as we've said many, many times before, the gross margin is affected by really 25 to 30 different factors, where FX or currency is one of them. And of course, one of the most important relations is between the U.S. dollars, since we source a lot in U.S. dollar, and the euro because, still, majority of our sales is done in euro. So in a very simple way, you could say that a strong dollar versus a weak euro is negative, all things equal. But things are not equal, so it's not that simple. At the moment, I would say it's pretty flattish. It's no dramatic changes. And then, just to explain a bit further, there is -- as soon as we have placed an order we hedge that, we lock in the markup, so to speak. So the effect on the currencies are, so to speak, postponed until we sell the garment, and you'll see it in our P&L.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to ask you to talk -- you had mentioned the spring/summer collections and, clearly, there've been a lot of strength in the numbers the last couple of quarters. Can you talk about what you think some of the key factors were in those collections that drove such strong sales and margins? And then, maybe talk about the strategies in the future to replicate that kind of success with future collections.\n\n---\n\nWell, I think it's difficult to point out a specific product, a specific factor. I think it's a combination of many, many different factors. But all in all, we believe that -- I mean, we always work with continuous improvement, and we've done a lot of efforts -- we always do a lot of efforts in order to improve the collections. And certainly, we are very happy and the customers seem to be also very happy with the spring and summer collections. But it's very difficult to pinpoint a specific detail or so.\n\n---\n\nAnd just to follow up. So there hasn't been any change in the design process or the collection rollout process or anything like that?\n\n---\n\nNo, not really. I mean, apart from the fact that we continuously work with improvement, and there are always changes going on, but it's more evolution. There's no dramatic change that has been done, no.\n\n---\n\nJust to add, it's the whole customer experience also in the stores, the total customer offering. We have been working a lot with the customer offering. One part is the sustainability work we do. So it's a lot of different factors affecting the turnover. So we shouldn't forget the efforts we are doing in many, many areas, like sustainability and the store experience.\n\n---\n\nCan you -- is your guidance for the longer-term investment package 2014 still SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million? And what would you say -- what would you guide for 2015, please?\n\n---\n\nWhen it comes to the guidance that we gave earlier, SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million for 2014, we are -- now it looks more SEK 800 million or slightly above for 2014. And for next year, it's too early to give you an exact figure how it will look. We will have to come back to that in connection with the Q4 year-end report. But what we can say is that the long-term investments will be -- be on -- still, on a high level in 2015.\n\n---\n\nLovely. And could you just give us some idea on CapEx? I think it was north of SEK 9 billion for this year, is that right?\n\n---\n\nYes. As we've said, we started the year to guide you in a range of SEK 9 billion to SEK 9.5 billion, and now it looks like it will be within that range, but maybe more towards SEK 9.5 billion. But as we always say, it's still, even though we are in September, there are moving parts, still. We are opening, I think, 180, 185 stores still in Q4 and, of course, that could have some moving parts. But that's the best guidance that may be towards SEK 9.5 billion.\n\n---\n\nRight. And for next year, would that grow in line with -- what sort of level of growth would you expect on that for next year?\n\n---\n\nThat, we have to come back to in connection with the year-end report to have a better guidance for 2015.\n\n---\n\nHopefully, there will be some new stores next year as well.\n\n---\n\nJust interested in the markdowns, which you said in Q3 was slightly higher than the corresponding quarter last year. Can you give us a sense of the markdown or if you don't want to do that, just the incremental change, Q3 versus Q3 last year, please, and why that was?\n\n---\n\nYes. They are slightly higher, less than 20 basis points than compared to Q3 last year. And it's not always as simple that we have a stock problem or too high stock or certain products that is not selling with the planned speed. As we have said, we have been happy with the stock-in-trade level when we went into Q3, and we are happy with the stock level and composition in the end of Q3 as well. But it can also be a situation that we feel is quite common, especially with these past years, that it's still a very high level of price activities on several markets. And then, of course, if we see that the competition is doing a lot of the price activities, for instance, back-to-school activities, then, of course, we also have to react on that. So it's a lot of the salesmanship also included in working with reductions. So it hasn't always to be a stock problem.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Just lastly, a follow-up on the same question, so it isn't an additional one. Given September was a bit weaker than expected, I guess it's going to affect everybody because of the weather. But assuming October, November are a bit stronger, given your stock levels are a bit higher, you'd still be comfortable that there shouldn't be substantial potential markdown effects if the remaining part of the quarter, actually, is back to your sort of growth expectations? You'd still be comfortable?\n\n---\n\nAs we said, we have a good level of stock-in-trade as per end August and also the composition, but it's far too early to say anything about the reduction levels for Q4. We still have more than 2 months ahead of us, and especially if the market situation is that it's tough selling figures on the market, it might be that the promotion activities and price activities also will increase during the quarter. So -- but it's far too early to have any guidance when we still left over 2 months in Q4. So we have to come back to that in connection with the next quarterly report.\n\n---\n\nI had a question about the long-term investments online. And just wondered if you could update us on what you're doing to improve your delivery offer and, in particular, moving towards click-and-collect, perhaps. Just looking for an update on some of your key markets.\n\n---\n\nYes, of course. We are, as you've heard, investing a lot in long-term investments, and a lot of that is, of course, aimed for online. So for us, top priorities is expansion, to roll out into new markets. But parallel to that, of course, we work with a number of things to improve the customer experience, including -- and lots of factors, like click-and-collect, that we're looking at. But -- and gradually, we are improving the customer -- it's not that it's bad today, but it can always be improved, and a lot of things are going on. Any follow-up to that or is that it?\n\n---\n\nPerhaps, I can just try ask you just another slight one. You said last time that you were already online in around 65% to 70% of your market. I'm guessing, by the end of -- by sales. I'm guessing, by the end of the year, you'll probably be somewhere around 75% to 85%. Could you: A, confirm that; and b, by the end of next year, once you've opened another 8 to 10 countries, would you be nearer sort of 95%, 100% -- probably, approaching...\n\n---\n\nWe are approaching 100%, absolutely. But I mean, it's been pleasing. If you look at the quarterly report and just take the countries where we have online, they represent, as you say, more than 75% already. And of course, the 8 to 10 new markets we plan to open next year will add that figure even more. So yes.\n\n---\n\nCan we just talk a little bit about the overall impact of the Sport collection and the shoes and all of these other product initiatives in terms of what that's doing to your average prices?\n\n---\n\nAverage prices? It doesn't have any material effect on the average prices in the world, but what it does do, of course, is that it extends our offering and we attract even more customers. And the stores we open actually tend to be larger and larger, that I can say.\n\n---\n\nRight. But obviously, a lot of these will be at higher prices generally than your kind of normal offer. So surely, won't it be mixing your average pricing up?\n\n---\n\nI see what you mean. But that's more up to you to speculate in. But it's not the reason that we want to drive the ASP.\n\n---\n\nBut it's also widespread in the price range so, of course, they will -- when we are increasing the assortment in shoes, for instance, we will not only increase the higher price group, we will also have the mid-priced, low-priced. So I think that's the mix. So I don't think that will have a material effect on the average sales price. It's looking at the whole H&M assortment.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Could I just also ask about your attitude to other online distribution? I mean, clearly, your primary focus is distributing H&M, in particular, through the -- through your own platforms. But particularly with your smaller brands, what have you done so far in terms of using kind of third-party distribution methods?\n\n---\n\nWell, first of all, if we take the brand, Cheap Monday, that's sold through several different platforms or other companies because it's a wholesale operation, and also including ASOS. And we have there, Monki, it is sold through ASOS as well. And I think that's it at the moment.\n\n---\n\nBut of course, we are looking -- but first priority is, of course, to use our own platform. But of course, there are possibilities all around the globe, for instance, in China, Tmall, et cetera. So -- but we will prioritize our own channel.\n\n---\n\nYes. And do you think that would be appropriate for COS?\n\n---\n\nFor COS, I mean, we're very prismatic but, so far, we have COS in, I think, 18 or 17 markets online. And it our own platform and it's very successful.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to pick up from that latest point on -- about Tmall. Wanted to ask about the online in China. You certainly have gone on -- have started very well. Are you planning to go on Tmall? And if yes, how soon? And also, in terms of the online impact...\n\n---\n\nIf we just take the first question. As Jyrki just said, I mean, the preferred path is always to do it organic, through our own platform. That's how we have started and we're very happy so far, even though it's very early stage, I must say. But however, we were very pragmatic and, of course, we mentioned Tmall as an option, but who knows? I mean, that's something we will have to follow up.\n\n---\n\nOkay. In terms of the impact of -- that online has to your sales and profits, and I appreciate that China, that's very early. But if I look at the non-store growth in countries that you have operated online, like the U.S., France and Spain or even Italy, they have shown some pretty significant accretion there. Do you confirm or do you also believe that online has been earnings-accretive or do you feel that's the same -- it has the same profitability as in -- as in-store?\n\n---\n\nAre you talking about margins or top line or what are you talk about?\n\n---\n\nTop line and margin.\n\n---\n\nWell, we've said many, many times that, for us, online is more or less on the same profitability level as stores. And we also said that online is a very good complement to the offline, and so we're talking about a seamless -- omni-channel shopping experience. So that's clearly why we invest so much and roll it out so rapid now because we see it's a very interesting way going forward.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Last one for me. If we think very long term, because now you do -- your growth markets are China and the U.S. and, I guess, little more emerging markets than your core German and the Nordics countries. If we think that your expansion now is going to be more into the emerging markets, potentially, how should we think about the long-term gross margin? Should we think about a different mix or, more or less, the different geographies have very, very similar gross margins?\n\n---\n\nOf course, there are different margin -- gross margins in different markets, however, for us, it's always about the pricing strategy. We always start from the customer perspective, and we actually have the same price strategy in all markets. Then, of course, gross margin can differ from market-to-market, depending on different cost levels, different import costs, VAT, et cetera. But the spread between the countries, on a price perspective, is -- it's quite limited.\n\n---\n\nAnd in the long term, it's dependent on what's happening on the market. So if the market is trending towards lower gross margins or higher gross margins, of course, we are following the markets. But as Nils said, we always start from the customer offering, and that's the main focus in our business. As you said, long term, that's a word we like.\n\n---\n\nBut as it stands today, can you say that the gross margin, as it stands today, is higher in the emerging markets versus the established markets or not really?\n\n---\n\nFirst of all, we don't split up the world in emerging markets and non-emerging markets. We look at each markets, per se, and there are differences, but no dramatic differences.\n\n---\n\nI had sort of follow-up questions on the operating cost. Firstly, further to Rebecca's question about the long-term investments. I think given what you indicated through the first 3 quarters, even if we're going to go slightly over SEK 800 million for the full year, that implies a substantial drop in that cost in the fourth quarter. I just want to confirm that I'm interpreting that correctly. And then, I've got a follow-up question on store cost.\n\n---\n\nYes, we don't give any figures for the fourth quarter when it comes to this. But our guidance is that full year, we'll be slightly above SEK 800 million. So I think, in average, I would say it's more or less on the same level as the third -- 3 first quarters have been, in average. So I think it's no major, major changes. Maybe -- maybe than -- slightly less than in Q3, but no major differences in level.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then, you alluded that costs in existing stores rose, but rose about less than the sales in those existing stores.\n\n---\n\nCorrect, yes.\n\n---\n\nSo if I just say simply like-for-like store cost rose slightly, that would be the first time that that has happened in over a year. I'm just wondering, is this the annualization of specific cost savings initiatives, and we should, therefore, think that like-for-like store costs might start to creep up again? Or how can we think about the dynamics there?\n\n---\n\nNo. I think the normal situation, when we have a sales increase as high as we had in the third quarter, the normal situation is, of course, that we have to add a lot of more hours in the stores, in the logistic organization, et cetera. So I would say that, that's the normal situation. We have been successful in several quarters to have a good balance in the comparable stores. And we still have very good cost controls. As you said, we are increasing the absolute figures but still, as a share of sales, it's better than last year. But for me, there's still very good cost control. And then, also, there are differences in quarters, even though the sales development might be the same, like Q2, plus 20, Q3, plus 21, more or less the same levels. But there is a big difference how much volumes you handle during Q3 compared to Q2. A quarter where you have, like, a big summer sale, of course, you handle much more volumes, both in the logistical chain and also in the stores. So it's a little bit tougher to have a leverage during big reduction quarters. So -- but I think I'm convinced that we will, also in the future, have very good cost controls in our comparable stores.\n\n---\n\nUnderstood. And one final brief question. I know you don't disclose like-for-like sales specifically anymore but, last quarter, you confirmed that the big contribution from new space was running broadly level. Is that still the case or those new space and new online could have driven some of that strong growth?\n\n---\n\nCould you rephrase the question, please?\n\n---\n\nWell, I'll put simply, were your like-for-like sales as strong in Q3 as Q2?\n\n---\n\nYes, absolutely.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nMy question concerns the launch of the 8 to 10 online markets in 2015. I'm wondering how much of the investment for that fell into 2014 or falls into 2014?\n\n---\n\nWas the question the long-term investments, how much of the part from 2015 will fall in, in 2014 or?\n\n---\n\nYes. For the 8 to 10 online markets that will be launched in 2015, how much of that falls into 2014?\n\n---\n\nExactly how much but, of course, we will start, and already have been starting to make, preparations with those 8 to 10 new online markets that we are going to open in 2015. But exactly how much of that will land in this current year, it depends on how good we are in getting the process ahead. So that's for sure. We have been working simultaneously with these 8, 10 markets already now, and we'll continue now in the fourth quarter.\n\n---\n\nI'm going to ask on the long-term investments, and there's sort of 2 bits to it, really. The first, when you think about your Conscious collection, your sort of move towards more organic cotton, are these initiatives part of your long-term investment program as you classify it? Or are they just completely separate?\n\n---\n\nThey are not included in the long term that we're talking, SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million. They are not included in that figure.\n\n---\n\nBut still, they're very long term.\n\n---\n\nThey are very long term, but not in that sense.\n\n---\n\nAnd in terms of your sort of price points on them, are they something that you just absorb the additional cost of any incremental bits that are more expensive or do you pass it through to the consumer and the consumer accepts the -- charge?\n\n---\n\nWe absorb it.\n\n---\n\nWe absorb it.\n\n---\n\nAnd in the medium term, would you expect your proportion of sort of sustainable cotton, organic cotton, et cetera, to increase overall?\n\n---\n\nYes, the goal is that by 2020, all cotton should be from more sustainable sources.\n\n---\n\nAnd how much do you think that would cost you?\n\n---\n\nA lot. But this is something we think is very -- of course, it's an investment, but for us, it's very -- as Karl-Johan writes in the report, we're, \"investing in our common future.\"\n\n---\n\nAnd I think that this is one part of having a good sales development in the future. I think more and more customers, they are really putting focus on how companies work with sustainability, and so I think it shouldn't be looked as a cost. I think it's an investment for the future. It's one of the most important investments in our customer offering. So I think it's very basic for us that, of course, we should do this.\n\n---\n\nI think you're certainly ahead of the game, but the fact that it's described as very long term and a big investment, I just thought it might fall into the long-term investment costs [ph].\n\n---\n\nNo, it's not falling in those SEK 800-plus million.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And secondly, in terms of those long-term investment costs going into online and IT, when you mentioned earlier about online sales being roughly the same profitability as in-store sales, is that after sort of allocation of all of those long-term investment costs included within that number?\n\n---\n\nYes, but these investments that we are activating in the balance sheet, of course, they will start to be depreciated there. So of course, the cost will come into that online business as well. Now we activate in the balance sheet and now we already have been starting to make some depreciations of them. So...\n\n---\n\nBut I see what you mean. We don't break it down in more detail because we also invest for, like I said, omni-channel, which is for both channels. We don't see it so clearly as separate, but it's absolutely clear that it's not -- what you're asking for is if it's margin-dilutive or not, no, it's not.\n\n---\n\nSo it's not margin-dilutive, including all of the allocated costs?\n\n---\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\nMy question is about China. I know that you mentioned that it's one of the key countries for future store openings. And having gone there this summer and talking to some real estate professionals, the sense that I took away was that there's too much retail space being opened and too many malls being opened. So the first question is are you seeing that? And then, how do you take that into account when you think about your own store openings?\n\n---\n\nWell, this is, of course, a risk and that's why it's important to have good teams in place. Now we have several expansions teams in place and monitor the expansion and should be the right malls because, as you say, there's a lot of malls being constructed and all of them will not succeed. But it's key to map the ones that we feel are the best ones. And of course, in that sense, it's very important and very good to have a strong brand, and H&M is one of the strongest brands in fashion apparel, globally and in China.\n\n---\n\nAnd doesn't it -- there's no -- you don't feel there's any need to slow openings to test, just wait and see which malls are going to be the right ones or anything like that?\n\n---\n\nWell, we always want to grow with quality, as we say. So there's a lot of work going on and careful benchmarking between the different options, and we feel very comfortable with the expansion pace we have at the moment.\n\n---\n\nCan you talk a little bit about, as you think about the month of September and the different markets: Europe, U.S, Asia, are there markets that are specifically slower, as you had mentioned, Germany? And with the level of markdowns, given the slower September, how are you gauging the level of markdowns? And then, lastly, on the compensation expense...\n\n---\n\nPlease, please, please -- Dana, please, 1 question at a time for all the listeners on the call. Okay. So the first question, if we see differences? Yes, of course, we do. And we feel that's one way of analyzing is it weather, is it collection? And there are, of course, differences in -- and depending on what country you have. And in some countries where it's been very cold, of course, that's affecting sales more. And in some countries where it's been colder, we've seen very good sales development, of course.\n\n---\n\nAnd is the U.S. different than Europe? Is it different markets -- different?\n\n---\n\nIf you're talking about the first 2 weeks in September, I think the weather in Europe has been much warmer historically than may be the situation in, like, North America.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then, in terms of compensation expense, how do you see that impact the change in compensation expense, that impact on operating expenses going forward?\n\n---\n\nCompensation -- do you mean salary increase or...\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think...\n\n---\n\nThat you had mentioned.\n\n---\n\nOur own?\n\n---\n\nIn sourcing...\n\n---\n\nIn sourcing or our own salary?\n\n---\n\nOn the compensation expense, the change that was made, that was mentioned in the release, how does that impact the expense structure?\n\n---\n\nYou're talking about our incentive program?\n\n---\n\nThe incentive program?\n\n---\n\nYes, exactly. Yes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Okay, then it's clear. It's good that you mentioned it. The -- we call it HIP, H&M Incentive Program, which is for all staff, all, no matter what country you work in and no matter what salary you have, and you have to work for 5 years in H&M to get included in the program. And the rules say that if H&M's profit year-on-year increases, 10% of the net profit after-tax, before HIP, should be paid to HIP. So hopefully, if we continue like this, there will be a payout in Q4.\n\n---\n\nSo it will affect the Q4 results.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nObviously, you don't disclose like-for-like anymore, but when you look at your store performance, what's driving the growth in same stores? Is it, like, managing to get more footfall in? Is it basket size? What's the dynamic behind the like-for-like expansion?\n\n---\n\nAgain, for it is, as you know, one of the most competitive industries in the globe perhaps and we don't want to go reveal all the -- of course, we keep track of all these KPIs. But I think the most important thing is what we mentioned before, even stronger collections and better customer experience in the stores and online, of course, yes.\n\n---\n\nCool. And just a totally unconnected follow-up, did I hear you say you're going to open 180 stores in Q4? And is that gross or net?\n\n---\n\nGross.\n\n---\n\nSo we will -- gross.\n\n---\n\nIs your promotional policy online consistent with the -- your promotional strategy in the stores?\n\n---\n\nOf course, but it has to be adjusted for -- for the channel.\n\n---\n\nRight. So it isn't completely -- it doesn't completely reflect what's going on in-store, then?\n\n---\n\nWell, yes and no. I mean, we've got 1 H&M, but then, each channel has to be adjusted for. So it could be that you sometimes have a markdown activity online, and sometimes it's something that you will find in stores but of course, what we -- it's coordinated centrally.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And my second question, please, is how has your average transaction value online trended since you sort of started out into new markets? Have you seen an increase in the average transaction value or?\n\n---\n\nThe average transaction value?\n\n---\n\nAverage order value or average basket size online?\n\n---\n\nThat's, of course, we monitor this very closely. And again, sorry, it's not something we want to go into details in.\n\n---\n\nJust one follow-up for me. As you expand into new geographies, obviously, Australia next year, South Africa. So potentially more Southern Hemisphere. Do you have to make material changes to your supply chain, supplier base, distribution, logistics? Or is that something that you're comfortable with? Can you just explain how you are looking at that expansion to the Southern Hemisphere, please?\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely. You're touching upon something that was a hinder for us before we launched H&M in the Southern Hemisphere, and that's, of course, due to the complexity with the reverse season. Because now, when we have autumn, they have spring, et cetera. But we have developed a way of coming around that and, obviously, our customers in the first 2 stores in the Southern Hemisphere are very happy. You've seen the figures in each Chile and in Australia. So of course, now there's a very interesting potential for us to scale this up and open up a lot of stores in the Southern Hemisphere. But exactly how we have solved it, it's not something we want to go into details with everybody. But the most important thing is that the customers in the Southern Hemisphere can -- they can, of course, find the latest trends and seasonal products.\n\n---\n\nSo you're comfortable that you've got the supply chain right in terms of the different seasonality of the products? It sounds like you're having no problems there.\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely.\n\n---\n\nOne follow-up for me as well, a technical one, probably. On the gross margin, you mentioned that 30 basis points is from the long-term investments, negative, and another maybe 15 to 20 basis points is from the markdowns. Then, that explains the whole gross margin difference. In which case, I wonder why do you say that the external factors are slightly negative? Am I missing something here?\n\n---\n\nWell, you're not missing anything. But again, there are maybe 25 or 30 different factors and so there are a lot of other things and some of them might be positive and some of them might be negative, but we point out 2 of the -- 2 of them.\n\n---\n\nIs FX positive or negative for the gross margin in the quarter?\n\n---\n\nWhich -- which one?\n\n---\n\nThe FX.\n\n---\n\nFX is positive, yes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So with that, thank you, all, very much for participating in this conference call, and welcome back for the full year results on the 28th of January next year.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Erik Karlsson (Analysts)】\nI was just wondering, on the online, given that you said China was launched a little earlier than expected, what is the potential to accelerate the opening for the coming 8 to 10 markets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nDon't get too carried away now. We -- there's intense work going on for the preparation for the 8 to 10 new markets, and we will come back to you in due time when they will open. But it's -- I want to remind you again, it's a lot of work and we invest a lot on this but, of course, it's in our own interest.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Erik Karlsson (Analysts)】\nCan I just follow up on that? Could you just tell us a little how the work on the standardized online platform is going?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nIt's going very well. As you can see, we've now launched 4 new markets within a very short time. So of course, that's boding well for the future.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Cedric Lecasble (Analysts)】\nCedric Lecasble from Raymond James. I have a question on FX. The impact -- the potential impact on sourcing COS. How are you dealing today with rapidly evolving FX, and USD in particular? And what kind of impact could you expect beyond next quarter? Do you think it could change, put a little more pressure on your gross margin?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nAgain, as we've said many, many times before, the gross margin is affected by really 25 to 30 different factors, where FX or currency is one of them. And of course, one of the most important relations is between the U.S. dollars, since we source a lot in U.S. dollar, and the euro because, still, majority of our sales is done in euro. So in a very simple way, you could say that a strong dollar versus a weak euro is negative, all things equal. But things are not equal, so it's not that simple. At the moment, I would say it's pretty flattish. It's no dramatic changes. And then, just to explain a bit further, there is -- as soon as we have placed an order we hedge that, we lock in the markup, so to speak. So the effect on the currencies are, so to speak, postponed until we sell the garment, and you'll see it in our P&L.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Omar Saad (Analysts)】\nI wanted to ask you to talk -- you had mentioned the spring/summer collections and, clearly, there've been a lot of strength in the numbers the last couple of quarters. Can you talk about what you think some of the key factors were in those collections that drove such strong sales and margins? And then, maybe talk about the strategies in the future to replicate that kind of success with future collections.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWell, I think it's difficult to point out a specific product, a specific factor. I think it's a combination of many, many different factors. But all in all, we believe that -- I mean, we always work with continuous improvement, and we've done a lot of efforts -- we always do a lot of efforts in order to improve the collections. And certainly, we are very happy and the customers seem to be also very happy with the spring and summer collections. But it's very difficult to pinpoint a specific detail or so.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Omar Saad (Analysts)】\nAnd just to follow up. So there hasn't been any change in the design process or the collection rollout process or anything like that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nNo, not really. I mean, apart from the fact that we continuously work with improvement, and there are always changes going on, but it's more evolution. There's no dramatic change that has been done, no.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nJust to add, it's the whole customer experience also in the stores, the total customer offering. We have been working a lot with the customer offering. One part is the sustainability work we do. So it's a lot of different factors affecting the turnover. So we shouldn't forget the efforts we are doing in many, many areas, like sustainability and the store experience.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nCan you -- is your guidance for the longer-term investment package 2014 still SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million? And what would you say -- what would you guide for 2015, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nWhen it comes to the guidance that we gave earlier, SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million for 2014, we are -- now it looks more SEK 800 million or slightly above for 2014. And for next year, it's too early to give you an exact figure how it will look. We will have to come back to that in connection with the Q4 year-end report. But what we can say is that the long-term investments will be -- be on -- still, on a high level in 2015.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nLovely. And could you just give us some idea on CapEx? I think it was north of SEK 9 billion for this year, is that right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes. As we've said, we started the year to guide you in a range of SEK 9 billion to SEK 9.5 billion, and now it looks like it will be within that range, but maybe more towards SEK 9.5 billion. But as we always say, it's still, even though we are in September, there are moving parts, still. We are opening, I think, 180, 185 stores still in Q4 and, of course, that could have some moving parts. But that's the best guidance that may be towards SEK 9.5 billion.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nRight. And for next year, would that grow in line with -- what sort of level of growth would you expect on that for next year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nThat, we have to come back to in connection with the year-end report to have a better guidance for 2015.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nHopefully, there will be some new stores next year as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nJust interested in the markdowns, which you said in Q3 was slightly higher than the corresponding quarter last year. Can you give us a sense of the markdown or if you don't want to do that, just the incremental change, Q3 versus Q3 last year, please, and why that was?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes. They are slightly higher, less than 20 basis points than compared to Q3 last year. And it's not always as simple that we have a stock problem or too high stock or certain products that is not selling with the planned speed. As we have said, we have been happy with the stock-in-trade level when we went into Q3, and we are happy with the stock level and composition in the end of Q3 as well. But it can also be a situation that we feel is quite common, especially with these past years, that it's still a very high level of price activities on several markets. And then, of course, if we see that the competition is doing a lot of the price activities, for instance, back-to-school activities, then, of course, we also have to react on that. So it's a lot of the salesmanship also included in working with reductions. So it hasn't always to be a stock problem.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nOkay. Just lastly, a follow-up on the same question, so it isn't an additional one. Given September was a bit weaker than expected, I guess it's going to affect everybody because of the weather. But assuming October, November are a bit stronger, given your stock levels are a bit higher, you'd still be comfortable that there shouldn't be substantial potential markdown effects if the remaining part of the quarter, actually, is back to your sort of growth expectations? You'd still be comfortable?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nAs we said, we have a good level of stock-in-trade as per end August and also the composition, but it's far too early to say anything about the reduction levels for Q4. We still have more than 2 months ahead of us, and especially if the market situation is that it's tough selling figures on the market, it might be that the promotion activities and price activities also will increase during the quarter. So -- but it's far too early to have any guidance when we still left over 2 months in Q4. So we have to come back to that in connection with the next quarterly report.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Caroline Gulliver (Analysts)】\nI had a question about the long-term investments online. And just wondered if you could update us on what you're doing to improve your delivery offer and, in particular, moving towards click-and-collect, perhaps. Just looking for an update on some of your key markets.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nYes, of course. We are, as you've heard, investing a lot in long-term investments, and a lot of that is, of course, aimed for online. So for us, top priorities is expansion, to roll out into new markets. But parallel to that, of course, we work with a number of things to improve the customer experience, including -- and lots of factors, like click-and-collect, that we're looking at. But -- and gradually, we are improving the customer -- it's not that it's bad today, but it can always be improved, and a lot of things are going on. Any follow-up to that or is that it?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Caroline Gulliver (Analysts)】\nPerhaps, I can just try ask you just another slight one. You said last time that you were already online in around 65% to 70% of your market. I'm guessing, by the end of -- by sales. I'm guessing, by the end of the year, you'll probably be somewhere around 75% to 85%. Could you: A, confirm that; and b, by the end of next year, once you've opened another 8 to 10 countries, would you be nearer sort of 95%, 100% -- probably, approaching...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWe are approaching 100%, absolutely. But I mean, it's been pleasing. If you look at the quarterly report and just take the countries where we have online, they represent, as you say, more than 75% already. And of course, the 8 to 10 new markets we plan to open next year will add that figure even more. So yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Irwin (Analysts)】\nCan we just talk a little bit about the overall impact of the Sport collection and the shoes and all of these other product initiatives in terms of what that's doing to your average prices?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nAverage prices? It doesn't have any material effect on the average prices in the world, but what it does do, of course, is that it extends our offering and we attract even more customers. And the stores we open actually tend to be larger and larger, that I can say.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Irwin (Analysts)】\nRight. But obviously, a lot of these will be at higher prices generally than your kind of normal offer. So surely, won't it be mixing your average pricing up?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nI see what you mean. But that's more up to you to speculate in. But it's not the reason that we want to drive the ASP.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nBut it's also widespread in the price range so, of course, they will -- when we are increasing the assortment in shoes, for instance, we will not only increase the higher price group, we will also have the mid-priced, low-priced. So I think that's the mix. So I don't think that will have a material effect on the average sales price. It's looking at the whole H&M assortment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Irwin (Analysts)】\nOkay. Could I just also ask about your attitude to other online distribution? I mean, clearly, your primary focus is distributing H&M, in particular, through the -- through your own platforms. But particularly with your smaller brands, what have you done so far in terms of using kind of third-party distribution methods?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWell, first of all, if we take the brand, Cheap Monday, that's sold through several different platforms or other companies because it's a wholesale operation, and also including ASOS. And we have there, Monki, it is sold through ASOS as well. And I think that's it at the moment.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nBut of course, we are looking -- but first priority is, of course, to use our own platform. But of course, there are possibilities all around the globe, for instance, in China, Tmall, et cetera. So -- but we will prioritize our own channel.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Irwin (Analysts)】\nYes. And do you think that would be appropriate for COS?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nFor COS, I mean, we're very prismatic but, so far, we have COS in, I think, 18 or 17 markets online. And it our own platform and it's very successful.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nI wanted to pick up from that latest point on -- about Tmall. Wanted to ask about the online in China. You certainly have gone on -- have started very well. Are you planning to go on Tmall? And if yes, how soon? And also, in terms of the online impact...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nIf we just take the first question. As Jyrki just said, I mean, the preferred path is always to do it organic, through our own platform. That's how we have started and we're very happy so far, even though it's very early stage, I must say. But however, we were very pragmatic and, of course, we mentioned Tmall as an option, but who knows? I mean, that's something we will have to follow up.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nOkay. In terms of the impact of -- that online has to your sales and profits, and I appreciate that China, that's very early. But if I look at the non-store growth in countries that you have operated online, like the U.S., France and Spain or even Italy, they have shown some pretty significant accretion there. Do you confirm or do you also believe that online has been earnings-accretive or do you feel that's the same -- it has the same profitability as in -- as in-store?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nAre you talking about margins or top line or what are you talk about?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nTop line and margin.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWell, we've said many, many times that, for us, online is more or less on the same profitability level as stores. And we also said that online is a very good complement to the offline, and so we're talking about a seamless -- omni-channel shopping experience. So that's clearly why we invest so much and roll it out so rapid now because we see it's a very interesting way going forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nOkay. Last one for me. If we think very long term, because now you do -- your growth markets are China and the U.S. and, I guess, little more emerging markets than your core German and the Nordics countries. If we think that your expansion now is going to be more into the emerging markets, potentially, how should we think about the long-term gross margin? Should we think about a different mix or, more or less, the different geographies have very, very similar gross margins?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nOf course, there are different margin -- gross margins in different markets, however, for us, it's always about the pricing strategy. We always start from the customer perspective, and we actually have the same price strategy in all markets. Then, of course, gross margin can differ from market-to-market, depending on different cost levels, different import costs, VAT, et cetera. But the spread between the countries, on a price perspective, is -- it's quite limited.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nAnd in the long term, it's dependent on what's happening on the market. So if the market is trending towards lower gross margins or higher gross margins, of course, we are following the markets. But as Nils said, we always start from the customer offering, and that's the main focus in our business. As you said, long term, that's a word we like.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nBut as it stands today, can you say that the gross margin, as it stands today, is higher in the emerging markets versus the established markets or not really?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nFirst of all, we don't split up the world in emerging markets and non-emerging markets. We look at each markets, per se, and there are differences, but no dramatic differences.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nI had sort of follow-up questions on the operating cost. Firstly, further to Rebecca's question about the long-term investments. I think given what you indicated through the first 3 quarters, even if we're going to go slightly over SEK 800 million for the full year, that implies a substantial drop in that cost in the fourth quarter. I just want to confirm that I'm interpreting that correctly. And then, I've got a follow-up question on store cost.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, we don't give any figures for the fourth quarter when it comes to this. But our guidance is that full year, we'll be slightly above SEK 800 million. So I think, in average, I would say it's more or less on the same level as the third -- 3 first quarters have been, in average. So I think it's no major, major changes. Maybe -- maybe than -- slightly less than in Q3, but no major differences in level.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then, you alluded that costs in existing stores rose, but rose about less than the sales in those existing stores.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nCorrect, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nSo if I just say simply like-for-like store cost rose slightly, that would be the first time that that has happened in over a year. I'm just wondering, is this the annualization of specific cost savings initiatives, and we should, therefore, think that like-for-like store costs might start to creep up again? Or how can we think about the dynamics there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nNo. I think the normal situation, when we have a sales increase as high as we had in the third quarter, the normal situation is, of course, that we have to add a lot of more hours in the stores, in the logistic organization, et cetera. So I would say that, that's the normal situation. We have been successful in several quarters to have a good balance in the comparable stores. And we still have very good cost controls. As you said, we are increasing the absolute figures but still, as a share of sales, it's better than last year. But for me, there's still very good cost control. And then, also, there are differences in quarters, even though the sales development might be the same, like Q2, plus 20, Q3, plus 21, more or less the same levels. But there is a big difference how much volumes you handle during Q3 compared to Q2. A quarter where you have, like, a big summer sale, of course, you handle much more volumes, both in the logistical chain and also in the stores. So it's a little bit tougher to have a leverage during big reduction quarters. So -- but I think I'm convinced that we will, also in the future, have very good cost controls in our comparable stores.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nUnderstood. And one final brief question. I know you don't disclose like-for-like sales specifically anymore but, last quarter, you confirmed that the big contribution from new space was running broadly level. Is that still the case or those new space and new online could have driven some of that strong growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nCould you rephrase the question, please?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nWell, I'll put simply, were your like-for-like sales as strong in Q3 as Q2?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nYes, absolutely.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anne Critchlow (Analysts)】\nMy question concerns the launch of the 8 to 10 online markets in 2015. I'm wondering how much of the investment for that fell into 2014 or falls into 2014?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nWas the question the long-term investments, how much of the part from 2015 will fall in, in 2014 or?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anne Critchlow (Analysts)】\nYes. For the 8 to 10 online markets that will be launched in 2015, how much of that falls into 2014?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nExactly how much but, of course, we will start, and already have been starting to make, preparations with those 8 to 10 new online markets that we are going to open in 2015. But exactly how much of that will land in this current year, it depends on how good we are in getting the process ahead. So that's for sure. We have been working simultaneously with these 8, 10 markets already now, and we'll continue now in the fourth quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Adam Cochrane (Analysts)】\nI'm going to ask on the long-term investments, and there's sort of 2 bits to it, really. The first, when you think about your Conscious collection, your sort of move towards more organic cotton, are these initiatives part of your long-term investment program as you classify it? Or are they just completely separate?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nThey are not included in the long term that we're talking, SEK 600 million to SEK 800 million. They are not included in that figure.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nBut still, they're very long term.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nThey are very long term, but not in that sense.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Adam Cochrane (Analysts)】\nAnd in terms of your sort of price points on them, are they something that you just absorb the additional cost of any incremental bits that are more expensive or do you pass it through to the consumer and the consumer accepts the -- charge?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWe absorb it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nWe absorb it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Adam Cochrane (Analysts)】\nAnd in the medium term, would you expect your proportion of sort of sustainable cotton, organic cotton, et cetera, to increase overall?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nYes, the goal is that by 2020, all cotton should be from more sustainable sources.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Adam Cochrane (Analysts)】\nAnd how much do you think that would cost you?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nA lot. But this is something we think is very -- of course, it's an investment, but for us, it's very -- as Karl-Johan writes in the report, we're, \"investing in our common future.\"\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nAnd I think that this is one part of having a good sales development in the future. I think more and more customers, they are really putting focus on how companies work with sustainability, and so I think it shouldn't be looked as a cost. I think it's an investment for the future. It's one of the most important investments in our customer offering. So I think it's very basic for us that, of course, we should do this.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Adam Cochrane (Analysts)】\nI think you're certainly ahead of the game, but the fact that it's described as very long term and a big investment, I just thought it might fall into the long-term investment costs [ph].\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nNo, it's not falling in those SEK 800-plus million.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Adam Cochrane (Analysts)】\nOkay. And secondly, in terms of those long-term investment costs going into online and IT, when you mentioned earlier about online sales being roughly the same profitability as in-store sales, is that after sort of allocation of all of those long-term investment costs included within that number?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, but these investments that we are activating in the balance sheet, of course, they will start to be depreciated there. So of course, the cost will come into that online business as well. Now we activate in the balance sheet and now we already have been starting to make some depreciations of them. So...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nBut I see what you mean. We don't break it down in more detail because we also invest for, like I said, omni-channel, which is for both channels. We don't see it so clearly as separate, but it's absolutely clear that it's not -- what you're asking for is if it's margin-dilutive or not, no, it's not.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Adam Cochrane (Analysts)】\nSo it's not margin-dilutive, including all of the allocated costs?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nNo.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nNo.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jamie Merriman (Analysts)】\nMy question is about China. I know that you mentioned that it's one of the key countries for future store openings. And having gone there this summer and talking to some real estate professionals, the sense that I took away was that there's too much retail space being opened and too many malls being opened. So the first question is are you seeing that? And then, how do you take that into account when you think about your own store openings?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWell, this is, of course, a risk and that's why it's important to have good teams in place. Now we have several expansions teams in place and monitor the expansion and should be the right malls because, as you say, there's a lot of malls being constructed and all of them will not succeed. But it's key to map the ones that we feel are the best ones. And of course, in that sense, it's very important and very good to have a strong brand, and H&M is one of the strongest brands in fashion apparel, globally and in China.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jamie Merriman (Analysts)】\nAnd doesn't it -- there's no -- you don't feel there's any need to slow openings to test, just wait and see which malls are going to be the right ones or anything like that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWell, we always want to grow with quality, as we say. So there's a lot of work going on and careful benchmarking between the different options, and we feel very comfortable with the expansion pace we have at the moment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Dana Telsey (Analysts)】\nCan you talk a little bit about, as you think about the month of September and the different markets: Europe, U.S, Asia, are there markets that are specifically slower, as you had mentioned, Germany? And with the level of markdowns, given the slower September, how are you gauging the level of markdowns? And then, lastly, on the compensation expense...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nPlease, please, please -- Dana, please, 1 question at a time for all the listeners on the call. Okay. So the first question, if we see differences? Yes, of course, we do. And we feel that's one way of analyzing is it weather, is it collection? And there are, of course, differences in -- and depending on what country you have. And in some countries where it's been very cold, of course, that's affecting sales more. And in some countries where it's been colder, we've seen very good sales development, of course.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Dana Telsey (Analysts)】\nAnd is the U.S. different than Europe? Is it different markets -- different?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nIf you're talking about the first 2 weeks in September, I think the weather in Europe has been much warmer historically than may be the situation in, like, North America.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Dana Telsey (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then, in terms of compensation expense, how do you see that impact the change in compensation expense, that impact on operating expenses going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nCompensation -- do you mean salary increase or...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Dana Telsey (Analysts)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, I think...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Dana Telsey (Analysts)】\nThat you had mentioned.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nOur own?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nIn sourcing...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nIn sourcing or our own salary?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Dana Telsey (Analysts)】\nOn the compensation expense, the change that was made, that was mentioned in the release, how does that impact the expense structure?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nYou're talking about our incentive program?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nThe incentive program?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Dana Telsey (Analysts)】\nYes, exactly. Yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nOkay. Okay, then it's clear. It's good that you mentioned it. The -- we call it HIP, H&M Incentive Program, which is for all staff, all, no matter what country you work in and no matter what salary you have, and you have to work for 5 years in H&M to get included in the program. And the rules say that if H&M's profit year-on-year increases, 10% of the net profit after-tax, before HIP, should be paid to HIP. So hopefully, if we continue like this, there will be a payout in Q4.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nSo it will affect the Q4 results.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Geoff Lowery (Analysts)】\nObviously, you don't disclose like-for-like anymore, but when you look at your store performance, what's driving the growth in same stores? Is it, like, managing to get more footfall in? Is it basket size? What's the dynamic behind the like-for-like expansion?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nAgain, for it is, as you know, one of the most competitive industries in the globe perhaps and we don't want to go reveal all the -- of course, we keep track of all these KPIs. But I think the most important thing is what we mentioned before, even stronger collections and better customer experience in the stores and online, of course, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Geoff Lowery (Analysts)】\nCool. And just a totally unconnected follow-up, did I hear you say you're going to open 180 stores in Q4? And is that gross or net?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nGross.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nSo we will -- gross.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nIs your promotional policy online consistent with the -- your promotional strategy in the stores?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nOf course, but it has to be adjusted for -- for the channel.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nRight. So it isn't completely -- it doesn't completely reflect what's going on in-store, then?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWell, yes and no. I mean, we've got 1 H&M, but then, each channel has to be adjusted for. So it could be that you sometimes have a markdown activity online, and sometimes it's something that you will find in stores but of course, what we -- it's coordinated centrally.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nOkay. And my second question, please, is how has your average transaction value online trended since you sort of started out into new markets? Have you seen an increase in the average transaction value or?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nThe average transaction value?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nAverage order value or average basket size online?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nThat's, of course, we monitor this very closely. And again, sorry, it's not something we want to go into details in.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nJust one follow-up for me. As you expand into new geographies, obviously, Australia next year, South Africa. So potentially more Southern Hemisphere. Do you have to make material changes to your supply chain, supplier base, distribution, logistics? Or is that something that you're comfortable with? Can you just explain how you are looking at that expansion to the Southern Hemisphere, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nAbsolutely. You're touching upon something that was a hinder for us before we launched H&M in the Southern Hemisphere, and that's, of course, due to the complexity with the reverse season. Because now, when we have autumn, they have spring, et cetera. But we have developed a way of coming around that and, obviously, our customers in the first 2 stores in the Southern Hemisphere are very happy. You've seen the figures in each Chile and in Australia. So of course, now there's a very interesting potential for us to scale this up and open up a lot of stores in the Southern Hemisphere. But exactly how we have solved it, it's not something we want to go into details with everybody. But the most important thing is that the customers in the Southern Hemisphere can -- they can, of course, find the latest trends and seasonal products.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nSo you're comfortable that you've got the supply chain right in terms of the different seasonality of the products? It sounds like you're having no problems there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nAbsolutely.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nOne follow-up for me as well, a technical one, probably. On the gross margin, you mentioned that 30 basis points is from the long-term investments, negative, and another maybe 15 to 20 basis points is from the markdowns. Then, that explains the whole gross margin difference. In which case, I wonder why do you say that the external factors are slightly negative? Am I missing something here?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWell, you're not missing anything. But again, there are maybe 25 or 30 different factors and so there are a lot of other things and some of them might be positive and some of them might be negative, but we point out 2 of the -- 2 of them.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nIs FX positive or negative for the gross margin in the quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWhich -- which one?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nThe FX.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nFX is positive, yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nOkay. So with that, thank you, all, very much for participating in this conference call, and welcome back for the full year results on the 28th of January next year.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thanks, operator. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Sasol's year-end results conference call today. Joining me here in Johannesburg from Sasol are Paul Victor, our acting Chief Financial Officer; Bernard Klingenberg, Executive Vice President for Southern Africa operations; and Steve Cornell, Executive Vice President, International Operations. \r\nAs you would have seen from our results announcement today, this past financial year, the group posted another outstanding all-around performance against our financial and operational targets. Underpinned by ongoing operational efficiencies, we outperformed our previous best efforts. \r\nTurning to Slide 4. Let me start with an overview of what you're going to hear today. First of all, we'll highlight what we mean by a new era for Sasol as a repositioned, restructured and refocused organization. And here, we'll be providing you with a 3-year overview so that you can better understand the magnitude of our achievements. I'll then talk you through the single key ingredient to our global growth drive, which is natural gas. Next, I'll update you on our business performance enhancement program, which is delivering operational efficiencies and driving cost discipline across the group. Paul Victor will then go into more detail on the financial and operational performance of our businesses. As part of summarizing why Sasol remains a very compelling investment case, I'll then provide you with more color on our Lake Charles chemicals project in Louisiana, and we'll open it up for any questions you'd like to ask us. \r\nMoving on to Slide 5. The necessity for change, first identified at the end 2011, arose out of the management team's commitment to sustain our strong operational and financial performance. Through implementation of our group-wide change program, in 2012, we started to reposition the organization by driving a single set of priorities across the group, with safe, stable and efficient operations at the core. In 2013, to ensure greater focus across the organization, we prioritized our project portfolio, which includes the clear articulation of our near- to medium-term strategy centered on 2 key regions, Southern Africa and North America. In parallel, from 2012 to 2014, we restructured the group and introduced changes to our top and senior management layers and corporate structures and cemented our longer-term strategic direction. These changes culminated in the rollout of our new operating model on July 1, when we implemented our revised structures and processes. \r\nNext, Slide 6 highlights a few noteworthy aspects of how we repositioned ourselves over the past 3 years. I'll not talk to the specific call-out boxes, but as you can see from the slide, Sasol has strategically repositioned itself to advance our gas-based growth programs concentrated largely in Southern Africa and North America. \r\nSo what is the net result of all of this? Looking at Slide 7, first, our headline earnings per share have, in the last 3 years, increased by 78%. Second, Sasol has increased dividend per share by 65% over the same period. And third, this performance has contributed to our share price increasing by 78%. In addition, total shareholder returns of 103% in rand terms were achieved over this period. Certainly, a very healthy position to build on. \r\nTurning to Slide 8. In looking at our growth programs, one ingredient is constant and that is natural gas. From 2008 to 2013, 9 of the 17 largest gas discoveries in the world have been in Sub-Saharan Africa. 2 of the top 3 gas discoveries have been in our neighboring country of Mozambique, and we are no strangers to Mozambique, having first entered the country in 1999. And now, 15 years later and with most of the required infrastructure in place, we have been processing and transporting gas for just over a decade. \r\nOver this period, we have steadily increased production, and as a consequence, our share of the gas produced in Mozambique has increased by 13% year-on-year to 116 million gigajoules. The increased production will not only allow more gas to be brought to South Africa, but will also enable greater in-country gas utilization in Mozambique. Here, at the end of last month, we inaugurated Mozambique's first permanent 175-megawatt gas-fired power plant in Ressano Garcia, which will serve to provide electricity to 2 million Mozambicans or 23% of the current power demand. In tandem, we're expanding the required pipeline infrastructure to facilitate the transportation of additional gas to Southern Mozambique and then into South Africa. This loopline, running in parallel to the existing line for the first 128 kilometers, will come onstream in the next 2 months. \r\nWe are also looking to expand our production efforts from the Production Sharing Agreement area. Here, we are planning to submit a field development plan next February, an important step in reserve development. To help assess the potential of the large gas reserves in Northern Mozambique earlier this year, we announced a gas-to-liquids pre-feasibility study together with our partners, ENH and Eni. \r\nCloser to home, we are also exploring for gas in the Durban basin off the KwaZulu-Natal coast. In June, we signed a conditional 40% farm-down agreement with Eni to explore and develop this block. The seismic survey has been completed, and the data is being processed. In addition, we are planning to drill an onshore concession Area A, which will facilitate further valuation of this under-explored portion of the Mozambique basin. \r\nMoving on to Slide 9. After a detailed diagnostic and to achieve our strategic objectives at the start of this past financial year, we officially launched a comprehensive business performance enhancement program, which cut across the entire organization. Our leadership structures are now complete and have, in FY '14, resulted in voluntary retrenchments and early retirements amongst the most senior layers of the organization. The restructuring process will be concluded in FY '15. \r\nThe catalyst for our restructuring was a development and introduction of our new operating model, which is organized along an integrated value chain. This new operating platform was effective from July 1, the start of our 2015 financial year. The consolidation and rightsizing of our corporate and legal structures were a crucial building block of our group-wide restructuring, particularly here in South Africa. This has resulted in a more effective and efficient decision-making and governance framework. With new structures, systems and processes now in place, we're confident that the program will deliver sustainable cost savings of at least ZAR 4 billion annually from 2016 onwards. We've already banked ZAR 469 million of cost savings in FY '14, or ZAR 700 million annualized, which was mainly achieved through voluntary retrenchments and reduced external spend. Looking ahead at our performance enhancement program, we'll continue to improve our operational productivity while benefiting from a more effective, simplified and tailor-made operating model. In FY '15, we expect cost savings of approximately ZAR 1.5 billion or ZAR 2.2 billion annualized. \r\nIn repositioning Sasol for a new era, a key feature of our license to operate is the broader contribution we make to society. Slide 10 provides a few highlights of our South African contributions in FY '14, as well as combined totals for the last 3 years. These important points are self-explanatory. \r\nTurning next to Slide 11 and to our FY '14 performance. It's clear that our solid operations underpinned our excellent results. At our Synfuels complex, improved plant efficiencies drove production up to 7.6 million tons, the highest output in a decade. In Qatar, our flagship GTL joint venture, the ORYX GTL plant, continues to achieve new production records coupled with an impressive safety recordable case rate of 0 over the past 3 years. \r\nIn terms of our financial performance and through the efforts of our business performance enhancement program, our normalized cash fixed costs were 1.8% below South African PPI. Headline earnings per share were up 14% to ZAR 60.16, another new record high. Attributable earnings were ZAR 29.6 billion, up 13% year-on-year, another all-time high. Cash generated from operations was up 26% to ZAR 65.5 billion, enabling a total dividend of ZAR 20.50 (sic) [ZAR 21.50] per share, another record which remains well aligned with our progressive dividend policy. \r\nWith that, let me now hand over to Paul, who will unpack our results in a little more detail. Paul?\n\n---\n\nThanks, David. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'm delighted to present our 2014 full year results to you today. We have, once again, delivered record earnings. \r\nOur reported earnings are at the midpoint of the guided range provided in our recent trading statement. Before I move into the details of the 2014 results, I would like to make a couple of remarks. First, management's continued focus on factors within our control has resulted in excellent underlying business performance, with improved volumes ahead of internal targets. Second, our continuous focus on cost control, coupled with the early successes of our business performance enhancement program, has seen us contain the increase in normalized cash fixed cost to well below inflation despite a very challenging South African cost environment. And finally, our robust cash flow-generating ability and ungeared balance sheet allows us to deliver superior returns through our progressive dividend policy while still positioning Sasol well to fund our attractive growth program and to provide a buffer for volatility. \r\nMoving to Slide 13. The macroeconomic environment remains volatile and uncertain. The average rand-U.S. dollar exchange rate was 17% weaker compared to the prior year, with the flat average being crude oil price and a progressive improvement in chemical prices. The Sasol business remains sensitive to significant movements in the rand-dollar exchange rate and oil prices, and we remind you of our sensitivities to each of these variables. We estimate that a ZAR 0.10 change in the annual average rand-dollar exchange rate and a $1 change in crude oil prices will affect our profits from global operations by approximately ZAR 860 million and ZAR 750 million, respectively. \r\nMoving to Slide 14. As mentioned in the half yearly results presentation, we adopted a new suite of consolidation accounting standards, resulting in changes in how certain of our engagements are accounted for in our financial results. Prior year numbers have been restated accordingly. For further details, I do refer you to our full results announcement. \r\nOverall, the group delivered an excellent business performance, supported by a weaker rand-dollar exchange rate and a progressive improvement in chemical prices. Headlines earnings per share increased by 14% to a new record of ZAR 60.16 per share. Operating profit of ZAR 41.7 billion was up 7% despite remeasurement items of ZAR 7.6 billion relating mainly to the ZAR 5.3 billion impairment of our Canadian shale gas assets and the ZAR 1.4 billion impairment and loss on disposal of our Solvents Germany assets. \r\nOur South African energy cluster delivered an overall strong performance, driven largely by the better-than-expected production performance from Synfuels despite the largest shutdown in its history and favorable rand product prices. In our international energy business, ORYX GTL, again, delivered a stellar operating performance, ahead of our own expectations, achieving a record annual average utilization rate of 97%, while in our chemicals cluster, both improved volumes and higher product prices boosted profitability. \r\nTurning to Slide 15. We are very and extremely pleased with our cost performance this year. The increase in normalized cash fixed cost has been contained to 1.8% below the South African producer price inflation of 7.3% for the 2014 financial year. Sustainable savings from our business performance enhancement program amounted to ZAR 469 million for the financial year, and net other cost savings identified assisted us, offsetting the impact of the ZAR 534 million penalty relating to the Polymer's Tribunal fine. Although overall, we benefited from a weaker rand-dollar exchange rate, the impact of the weaker rand added a 5.2% to the total cash fixed cost base. Cash implementation cost of our business performance enhancement program added a further 1.3%. Labor, maintenance and energy remains the main drivers of our cost base, with labor now comprising approximately 55% of our total cash fixed cost base. We have concluded wage settlements with the trade unions in the mining, chemical and petroleum sectors for the forthcoming year at increases averaging between 7.5% and 8.5%. \r\nOur strategy to contain energy costs has seen us successfully ramping up our electricity-generating capacity in South Africa to around 70% of our own requirements. We caution that cost pressures may be experienced as a result of higher-than-expected electricity price increases for the 2015 financial year. Our investment in plant maintenance over the recent years has successfully delivered plant stability and improved volumes across our key businesses. And finally, cost reduction continues to be one of the critical focus areas for management, and through our business performance enhancement program, we aim to beat the cost trends by means of focused business structural changes and process efficiency improvements. \r\nMoving on to Slide 16. The weaker rand-dollar exchange rate was the largest contributor to the increase in operating profit this year, boosting operating profit by 28%. Improved product prices added a further 3%. Year-end adjustments include a substantial increase in the provision for long-term employee share-based payment expenses of ZAR 3.6 billion, following a 47% increase in our share price over the financial year. Furthermore, additional remeasurement items of ZAR 1.3 billion, partially offset by the impact of the Sasol Wax fine refund of ZAR 2.5 billion, had a negative impact of 16% on profit from operations, joint ventures and associates. Higher depreciation charges in respect of new plants, as well as shutdown and factory maintenance, adversely affected operating profit by 6%. However, it is extremely encouraging to note the positive impact of the increased sales volumes of 7% across the group for 2014. This is on the back of a 7% increase in sales volumes for the 2013 financial year. The total increase in sales volumes over the last 2 years amounts to ZAR 4.5 billion in real terms on a record 2012 earnings base. \r\nMoving to Slide 17. Our SA energy cluster continues to underpin the group's profitability, as well as cash flow generation, contributing 90% to the group profitability. Sasol Mining's operating profit increased by 11%, benefiting from increased sales prices to Sasol Synfuels and a weaker rand. Normalized mining unit cost increases are successfully contained to only an increase of 7% for the 2014 financial year. Sasol Gas operating profit increased by 7%, mainly as a result of the 7% increase in sales volumes and a gain of ZAR 453 million on the disposal of our investment in Spring Lights Gas. Sasol Synfuels continues to underpin the group's profit, delivering an increase in operating profit of 15% and operating margins at 49%. The increase in profits were driven largely by the better-than-expected production volumes and a weaker rand. Production volumes increased by 2% to 7.6 million tons, a record for the past decade despite the largest shutdown in Synfuels' history. If the shutdown is excluded, production would have increased by 4%. Cash unit costs increased by 10.6% due to higher feedstock prices and energy costs. Management continues to focus on cost management and improved plant stability. Sasol Oil's operating profit decreased by 18%, with lower refining margins offsetting a 5% increase in sales volumes. The increase in sales volumes was against a backdrop of a relatively flat SA retail market growth rate. \r\nMoving on to Slide 18. We turn to our international energy cluster. Sasol Synfuels International recorded a 6% improvement in its operating loss to ZAR 935 million for the year, driven largely by low study costs. Our ORYX GTL joint venture delivered an exceptional performance on the back of a record annual average utilization rate of 97%, as well as a weaker rand. Our share of the income of our ORYX GTL joint venture increased by 52% to ZAR 4 billion. ORYX GTL's strong performance continued to reinforce our GTL value proposition. \r\nSasol Petroleum International recorded an operating loss of ZAR 6 billion for the year. Excluding Canada, SPI yielded an improved performance with an operating profit of ZAR 1 billion compared to an operating loss of ZAR 71 million in the prior year. In Africa, Mozambique and Gabon performed well, delivering a 9% increase in production volumes. We are also progressing well with our growth plans in Mozambique, which David expanded on earlier. \r\nOur Canadian upstream assets generated an operating loss of ZAR 7 billion, which includes the impact of a ZAR 5.3 billion impairment and a depreciation charge of ZAR 1.9 billion. The impairment, as announced at our 2014 interim results, was mainly due to the decline in North American gas prices. We continue to execute on our approved development plan in conjunction with our now new JV partner, Progress Energy. Drilling activities will increase once we see an improvement of the gas price. With our joint venture partner, Progress Energy, we aim to further reduce drilling and completion costs to below our original business case assumptions. \r\nMoving to Slide 19. We have continued to see an overall recovery in sales prices and volumes in our chemicals business. Our Polymer business is returning to profitability with a 5% increase in sales volumes. The operating loss of ZAR 35 million, after excluding once-off items of ZAR 732 million, reduced from an operating loss of ZAR 1.5 billion in the prior year. Plant efficiencies were mainly brought about by the commissioning of the EPU5 plant in October 2013. Solvents' 76% decrease in operating profit to ZAR 200 million was due to the negative impact of the sale of our Solvents Germany assets. On 31 May 2014, we disposed of our Solvents Germany assets totaling ZAR 1.4 billion in impairment and disposal losses. Adjusting for the sale of assets, operating profit would have increased by 54%, boosted by overall improved plant stability, as well as a weaker rand. O&S continued to deliver strong earnings growth, underpinned by consistent and reliable operations delivery and a weaker rand. Operating profit increased by 49% to ZAR 5.3 billion or 21% in euro terms, while operating margins expanded by 1% to 9.5%. Our U.S. business continues to benefit from low ethane prices. However, our European operations are still under margin pressure on the back of softer demand, coupled with higher petrochemical feedstock prices. Our other chemical business recorded an operating profit of ZAR 3.6 billion compared to ZAR 123 million operating profit in the prior year. This increase was largely the result of a ZAR 2.5 billion payment received in respect of a reduction on our 2009 fine paid by our Sasol Wax business due to the European Commission. This decision can still be appealed. Our Infrachem and Nitro business continued to experience challenging market conditions. \r\nTurning on to Slide 20. I would like to expand on what David touched on earlier in respect of our business performance enhancement program. We have increased our savings target and now expect to generate sustainable annual savings of at least ZAR 4 billion by 2016 from a 2013 cost base. We have already achieved a ZAR 469 million saving, or ZAR 700 million on an annualized basis, in the 2014 financial year and expect to generate an additional ZAR 1.5 billion, or ZAR 2.2 billion annualized, in the 2015 financial year with the balance realized by 2016. Further potential upside to these savings target will be communicated in due course. Project implementation costs of ZAR 1.3 billion were incurred for the 2014 financial year and expected to peak at approximately ZAR 2.1 billion in our 2015 financial year before tapering off in the 2016 financial year as we finalize implementation. We expect cash fixed cost to follow inflation from 2016. \r\nMoving to Slide 21. Taking into account our record earnings, the ongoing strength of our financial position, as well as our current capital investment plans and our progressive dividend policy, we have increased the final dividend by 1.5% to ZAR 13.50 per share, taking the full year dividend to a record ZAR 20.50 (sic) [ZAR 21.50], which is a 13.2% increase from the prior year. Our dividend yield of approximately 3.4% and our total shareholder return of 184%, measured over 5 years in rand terms, continue to position us competitively within our peer group. The compounded annual growth rate over the last 3 years of 18% in dividends, supported by 21% per annum growth rate in headline earnings per share, demonstrates our commitment to consistently return sustainable value to our shareholders. \r\nMoving to Slide 22. We continue to deliver strong cash flow generation across the group, as evidenced by the increase in cash flow generated from operations of 26% to ZAR 65.5 billion. This, together with the deleveraged balance sheet, which continues to reflect an ungeared position of 6.3% at year end, positions us uniquely to fund our growth program, as well as to deliver on our progressive dividend policy. We spent ZAR 40 billion on capital expenditure in the current financial year, of which 57% was spent in South Africa. We maintain our capital estimate for 2015 of ZAR 50 billion and estimate capital expenditure of approximately ZAR 65 billion for 2016. A substantial portion of our capital spend over the following 2 years will be towards our growth projects as we execute our gas-based growth strategy. \r\nMoving to Slide 23. We expect macroeconomic conditions to remain volatile and uncertain, which may impact our assumption in respect of economic variables. Our oil price and rand-dollar exchange rate views for now remain relatively unchanged, but we do want to highlight the increased risk of financial market volatility. We continue to focus on the factors within our control, that being volume growth, margin improvement and cost reduction. We expect an overall solid production performance for the 2015 financial year. Sasol Synfuels volumes are expected to be between 7.5 million and 7.6 million tons. We expect ORYX GTL average utilization rate of about 85%, taking the statutory shutdown into account. In Canada, we expect our gas throughput to be at similar levels compared to 2014 with incremental volume additions expected in our natural gas, ethylene and propylene value chains. We expect normalized cash fixed costs to follow inflation, although we do want to caution that cost increases may experience pressure due to higher-than-expected electricity price increases. \r\nIn conclusion, as we embark on a new era, we are very well placed to consistently deliver sustainable value to our shareholders. And on that note, I will hand back to David.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Paul, and I'll now direct you to Slide 25. In North America, the shale gas revolution, along with the wide differential between oil and gas prices and the abundance of low-cost ethane, have set the stage for attractive growth opportunities in the U.S., as you well know. This forms the basis of our gas-based growth program on the continent. \r\nIn pursuing our U.S. growth program, the key consideration was how to unlock maximum value for our shareholders over the long term. Looking specifically at our Lake Charles ethane cracker project, here are a few salient points to note. First, the front-end engineering and design work for the chemical complex is nearing completion, with the project economics remaining robust. Second, we have concluded term-based ethane feedstock supply agreements and have secured sufficient ethane transportation capacity, utilizing various pipelines. Third and crucially important, the air, water and wetlands permits for both the cracker and the gas-to-liquids facility were issued without any challenge or objection, which highlights the positive views our stakeholders have of these projects. Fourth and in parallel, we are making very good progress on the cracker financing. And fifth, our well-defined contracting strategy mixes fixed-price and reimbursable contracts. This will limit undue cost contingencies and the related risk.  Based on the significant progress made to date, we are confident that a final investment decision on the cracker will be taken before the end of this calendar year. \r\nFor my final slide, Slide 26 and to summarize, Sasol remains a compelling investment proposition, and this assertion is illustrated in the 3 columns you see on this slide. First, looking at our existing asset base, our foundation businesses are delivering record results. Here, our proven technologies and flagship plants in South Africa and Qatar continue to achieve impressive gains in throughput and efficiencies. Supported by our new operating model and cost discipline throughout the group, our foundation businesses provide us with a solid platform to springboard our expansion efforts. As you heard today from Paul, our businesses remain highly cash-generative, delivering strong cash flows. \r\nNext, our growth opportunities remain attractive. Here, our ambitions are based on harnessing a mix of key factors, including delivering on our near-term incremental growth projects in Southern Africa and also abroad; developing our gas-based growth programs in Southern Africa and North America; and getting ready to take a final investment decision on the first component of our U.S. megaprojects, the ethane cracker. \r\nFinally, Sasol continues to create value. A solid balance sheet, healthy cash flow generation continue to support our progressive dividend policy and the funding of our growth plans. Coupled with our dividends and through our share price performance, Sasol continues to create long-term shareholder value. \r\nWith that, we'd now be happy to open it up for any questions that you may have. Operator?",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nThanks, operator. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Sasol's year-end results conference call today. Joining me here in Johannesburg from Sasol are Paul Victor, our acting Chief Financial Officer; Bernard Klingenberg, Executive Vice President for Southern Africa operations; and Steve Cornell, Executive Vice President, International Operations. \r\nAs you would have seen from our results announcement today, this past financial year, the group posted another outstanding all-around performance against our financial and operational targets. Underpinned by ongoing operational efficiencies, we outperformed our previous best efforts. \r\nTurning to Slide 4. Let me start with an overview of what you're going to hear today. First of all, we'll highlight what we mean by a new era for Sasol as a repositioned, restructured and refocused organization. And here, we'll be providing you with a 3-year overview so that you can better understand the magnitude of our achievements. I'll then talk you through the single key ingredient to our global growth drive, which is natural gas. Next, I'll update you on our business performance enhancement program, which is delivering operational efficiencies and driving cost discipline across the group. Paul Victor will then go into more detail on the financial and operational performance of our businesses. As part of summarizing why Sasol remains a very compelling investment case, I'll then provide you with more color on our Lake Charles chemicals project in Louisiana, and we'll open it up for any questions you'd like to ask us. \r\nMoving on to Slide 5. The necessity for change, first identified at the end 2011, arose out of the management team's commitment to sustain our strong operational and financial performance. Through implementation of our group-wide change program, in 2012, we started to reposition the organization by driving a single set of priorities across the group, with safe, stable and efficient operations at the core. In 2013, to ensure greater focus across the organization, we prioritized our project portfolio, which includes the clear articulation of our near- to medium-term strategy centered on 2 key regions, Southern Africa and North America. In parallel, from 2012 to 2014, we restructured the group and introduced changes to our top and senior management layers and corporate structures and cemented our longer-term strategic direction. These changes culminated in the rollout of our new operating model on July 1, when we implemented our revised structures and processes. \r\nNext, Slide 6 highlights a few noteworthy aspects of how we repositioned ourselves over the past 3 years. I'll not talk to the specific call-out boxes, but as you can see from the slide, Sasol has strategically repositioned itself to advance our gas-based growth programs concentrated largely in Southern Africa and North America. \r\nSo what is the net result of all of this? Looking at Slide 7, first, our headline earnings per share have, in the last 3 years, increased by 78%. Second, Sasol has increased dividend per share by 65% over the same period. And third, this performance has contributed to our share price increasing by 78%. In addition, total shareholder returns of 103% in rand terms were achieved over this period. Certainly, a very healthy position to build on. \r\nTurning to Slide 8. In looking at our growth programs, one ingredient is constant and that is natural gas. From 2008 to 2013, 9 of the 17 largest gas discoveries in the world have been in Sub-Saharan Africa. 2 of the top 3 gas discoveries have been in our neighboring country of Mozambique, and we are no strangers to Mozambique, having first entered the country in 1999. And now, 15 years later and with most of the required infrastructure in place, we have been processing and transporting gas for just over a decade. \r\nOver this period, we have steadily increased production, and as a consequence, our share of the gas produced in Mozambique has increased by 13% year-on-year to 116 million gigajoules. The increased production will not only allow more gas to be brought to South Africa, but will also enable greater in-country gas utilization in Mozambique. Here, at the end of last month, we inaugurated Mozambique's first permanent 175-megawatt gas-fired power plant in Ressano Garcia, which will serve to provide electricity to 2 million Mozambicans or 23% of the current power demand. In tandem, we're expanding the required pipeline infrastructure to facilitate the transportation of additional gas to Southern Mozambique and then into South Africa. This loopline, running in parallel to the existing line for the first 128 kilometers, will come onstream in the next 2 months. \r\nWe are also looking to expand our production efforts from the Production Sharing Agreement area. Here, we are planning to submit a field development plan next February, an important step in reserve development. To help assess the potential of the large gas reserves in Northern Mozambique earlier this year, we announced a gas-to-liquids pre-feasibility study together with our partners, ENH and Eni. \r\nCloser to home, we are also exploring for gas in the Durban basin off the KwaZulu-Natal coast. In June, we signed a conditional 40% farm-down agreement with Eni to explore and develop this block. The seismic survey has been completed, and the data is being processed. In addition, we are planning to drill an onshore concession Area A, which will facilitate further valuation of this under-explored portion of the Mozambique basin. \r\nMoving on to Slide 9. After a detailed diagnostic and to achieve our strategic objectives at the start of this past financial year, we officially launched a comprehensive business performance enhancement program, which cut across the entire organization. Our leadership structures are now complete and have, in FY '14, resulted in voluntary retrenchments and early retirements amongst the most senior layers of the organization. The restructuring process will be concluded in FY '15. \r\nThe catalyst for our restructuring was a development and introduction of our new operating model, which is organized along an integrated value chain. This new operating platform was effective from July 1, the start of our 2015 financial year. The consolidation and rightsizing of our corporate and legal structures were a crucial building block of our group-wide restructuring, particularly here in South Africa. This has resulted in a more effective and efficient decision-making and governance framework. With new structures, systems and processes now in place, we're confident that the program will deliver sustainable cost savings of at least ZAR 4 billion annually from 2016 onwards. We've already banked ZAR 469 million of cost savings in FY '14, or ZAR 700 million annualized, which was mainly achieved through voluntary retrenchments and reduced external spend. Looking ahead at our performance enhancement program, we'll continue to improve our operational productivity while benefiting from a more effective, simplified and tailor-made operating model. In FY '15, we expect cost savings of approximately ZAR 1.5 billion or ZAR 2.2 billion annualized. \r\nIn repositioning Sasol for a new era, a key feature of our license to operate is the broader contribution we make to society. Slide 10 provides a few highlights of our South African contributions in FY '14, as well as combined totals for the last 3 years. These important points are self-explanatory. \r\nTurning next to Slide 11 and to our FY '14 performance. It's clear that our solid operations underpinned our excellent results. At our Synfuels complex, improved plant efficiencies drove production up to 7.6 million tons, the highest output in a decade. In Qatar, our flagship GTL joint venture, the ORYX GTL plant, continues to achieve new production records coupled with an impressive safety recordable case rate of 0 over the past 3 years. \r\nIn terms of our financial performance and through the efforts of our business performance enhancement program, our normalized cash fixed costs were 1.8% below South African PPI. Headline earnings per share were up 14% to ZAR 60.16, another new record high. Attributable earnings were ZAR 29.6 billion, up 13% year-on-year, another all-time high. Cash generated from operations was up 26% to ZAR 65.5 billion, enabling a total dividend of ZAR 20.50 (sic) [ZAR 21.50] per share, another record which remains well aligned with our progressive dividend policy. \r\nWith that, let me now hand over to Paul, who will unpack our results in a little more detail. Paul?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Paul Victor (Executives)】\nThanks, David. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'm delighted to present our 2014 full year results to you today.

If the shutdown is excluded, production would have increased by 4%. Cash unit costs increased by 10.6% due to higher feedstock prices and energy costs. Management continues to focus on cost management and improved plant stability. Sasol Oil's operating profit decreased by 18%, with lower refining margins offsetting a 5% increase in sales volumes. The increase in sales volumes was against a backdrop of a relatively flat SA retail market growth rate. \r\nMoving on to Slide 18. We turn to our international energy cluster. Sasol Synfuels International recorded a 6% improvement in its operating loss to ZAR 935 million for the year, driven largely by low study costs. Our ORYX GTL joint venture delivered an exceptional performance on the back of a record annual average utilization rate of 97%, as well as a weaker rand. Our share of the income of our ORYX GTL joint venture increased by 52% to ZAR 4 billion. ORYX GTL's strong performance continued to reinforce our GTL value proposition. \r\nSasol Petroleum International recorded an operating loss of ZAR 6 billion for the year. Excluding Canada, SPI yielded an improved performance with an operating profit of ZAR 1 billion compared to an operating loss of ZAR 71 million in the prior year. In Africa, Mozambique and Gabon performed well, delivering a 9% increase in production volumes. We are also progressing well with our growth plans in Mozambique, which David expanded on earlier. \r\nOur Canadian upstream assets generated an operating loss of ZAR 7 billion, which includes the impact of a ZAR 5.3 billion impairment and a depreciation charge of ZAR 1.9 billion. The impairment, as announced at our 2014 interim results, was mainly due to the decline in North American gas prices. We continue to execute on our approved development plan in conjunction with our now new JV partner, Progress Energy. Drilling activities will increase once we see an improvement of the gas price. With our joint venture partner, Progress Energy, we aim to further reduce drilling and completion costs to below our original business case assumptions. \r\nMoving to Slide 19. We have continued to see an overall recovery in sales prices and volumes in our chemicals business. Our Polymer business is returning to profitability with a 5% increase in sales volumes. The operating loss of ZAR 35 million, after excluding once-off items of ZAR 732 million, reduced from an operating loss of ZAR 1.5 billion in the prior year. Plant efficiencies were mainly brought about by the commissioning of the EPU5 plant in October 2013. Solvents' 76% decrease in operating profit to ZAR 200 million was due to the negative impact of the sale of our Solvents Germany assets. On 31 May 2014, we disposed of our Solvents Germany assets totaling ZAR 1.4 billion in impairment and disposal losses. Adjusting for the sale of assets, operating profit would have increased by 54%, boosted by overall improved plant stability, as well as a weaker rand. O&S continued to deliver strong earnings growth, underpinned by consistent and reliable operations delivery and a weaker rand. Operating profit increased by 49% to ZAR 5.3 billion or 21% in euro terms, while operating margins expanded by 1% to 9.5%. Our U.S. business continues to benefit from low ethane prices. However, our European operations are still under margin pressure on the back of softer demand, coupled with higher petrochemical feedstock prices. Our other chemical business recorded an operating profit of ZAR 3.6 billion compared to ZAR 123 million operating profit in the prior year. This increase was largely the result of a ZAR 2.5 billion payment received in respect of a reduction on our 2009 fine paid by our Sasol Wax business due to the European Commission. This decision can still be appealed. Our Infrachem and Nitro business continued to experience challenging market conditions. \r\nTurning on to Slide 20. I would like to expand on what David touched on earlier in respect of our business performance enhancement program. We have increased our savings target and now expect to generate sustainable annual savings of at least ZAR 4 billion by 2016 from a 2013 cost base. We have already achieved a ZAR 469 million saving, or ZAR 700 million on an annualized basis, in the 2014 financial year and expect to generate an additional ZAR 1.5 billion, or ZAR 2.2 billion annualized, in the 2015 financial year with the balance realized by 2016. Further potential upside to these savings target will be communicated in due course. Project implementation costs of ZAR 1.3 billion were incurred for the 2014 financial year and expected to peak at approximately ZAR 2.1 billion in our 2015 financial year before tapering off in the 2016 financial year as we finalize implementation. We expect cash fixed cost to follow inflation from 2016. \r\nMoving to Slide 21. Taking into account our record earnings, the ongoing strength of our financial position, as well as our current capital investment plans and our progressive dividend policy, we have increased the final dividend by 1.5% to ZAR 13.50 per share, taking the full year dividend to a record ZAR 20.50 (sic) [ZAR 21.50], which is a 13.2% increase from the prior year. Our dividend yield of approximately 3.4% and our total shareholder return of 184%, measured over 5 years in rand terms, continue to position us competitively within our peer group. The compounded annual growth rate over the last 3 years of 18% in dividends, supported by 21% per annum growth rate in headline earnings per share, demonstrates our commitment to consistently return sustainable value to our shareholders. \r\nMoving to Slide 22. We continue to deliver strong cash flow generation across the group, as evidenced by the increase in cash flow generated from operations of 26% to ZAR 65.5 billion. This, together with the deleveraged balance sheet, which continues to reflect an ungeared position of 6.3% at year end, positions us uniquely to fund our growth program, as well as to deliver on our progressive dividend policy. We spent ZAR 40 billion on capital expenditure in the current financial year, of which 57% was spent in South Africa. We maintain our capital estimate for 2015 of ZAR 50 billion and estimate capital expenditure of approximately ZAR 65 billion for 2016. A substantial portion of our capital spend over the following 2 years will be towards our growth projects as we execute our gas-based growth strategy. \r\nMoving to Slide 23. We expect macroeconomic conditions to remain volatile and uncertain, which may impact our assumption in respect of economic variables. Our oil price and rand-dollar exchange rate views for now remain relatively unchanged, but we do want to highlight the increased risk of financial market volatility. We continue to focus on the factors within our control, that being volume growth, margin improvement and cost reduction. We expect an overall solid production performance for the 2015 financial year. Sasol Synfuels volumes are expected to be between 7.5 million and 7.6 million tons. We expect ORYX GTL average utilization rate of about 85%, taking the statutory shutdown into account. In Canada, we expect our gas throughput to be at similar levels compared to 2014 with incremental volume additions expected in our natural gas, ethylene and propylene value chains. We expect normalized cash fixed costs to follow inflation, although we do want to caution that cost increases may experience pressure due to higher-than-expected electricity price increases. \r\nIn conclusion, as we embark on a new era, we are very well placed to consistently deliver sustainable value to our shareholders. And on that note, I will hand back to David.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nThank you, Paul, and I'll now direct you to Slide 25. In North America, the shale gas revolution, along with the wide differential between oil and gas prices and the abundance of low-cost ethane, have set the stage for attractive growth opportunities in the U.S., as you well know. This forms the basis of our gas-based growth program on the continent. \r\nIn pursuing our U.S. growth program, the key consideration was how to unlock maximum value for our shareholders over the long term. Looking specifically at our Lake Charles ethane cracker project, here are a few salient points to note. First, the front-end engineering and design work for the chemical complex is nearing completion, with the project economics remaining robust. Second, we have concluded term-based ethane feedstock supply agreements and have secured sufficient ethane transportation capacity, utilizing various pipelines. Third and crucially important, the air, water and wetlands permits for both the cracker and the gas-to-liquids facility were issued without any challenge or objection, which highlights the positive views our stakeholders have of these projects. Fourth and in parallel, we are making very good progress on the cracker financing. And fifth, our well-defined contracting strategy mixes fixed-price and reimbursable contracts. This will limit undue cost contingencies and the related risk.  Based on the significant progress made to date, we are confident that a final investment decision on the cracker will be taken before the end of this calendar year. \r\nFor my final slide, Slide 26 and to summarize, Sasol remains a compelling investment proposition, and this assertion is illustrated in the 3 columns you see on this slide. First, looking at our existing asset base, our foundation businesses are delivering record results. Here, our proven technologies and flagship plants in South Africa and Qatar continue to achieve impressive gains in throughput and efficiencies. Supported by our new operating model and cost discipline throughout the group, our foundation businesses provide us with a solid platform to springboard our expansion efforts. As you heard today from Paul, our businesses remain highly cash-generative, delivering strong cash flows. \r\nNext, our growth opportunities remain attractive. Here, our ambitions are based on harnessing a mix of key factors, including delivering on our near-term incremental growth projects in Southern Africa and also abroad; developing our gas-based growth programs in Southern Africa and North America; and getting ready to take a final investment decision on the first component of our U.S. megaprojects, the ethane cracker. \r\nFinally, Sasol continues to create value. A solid balance sheet, healthy cash flow generation continue to support our progressive dividend policy and the funding of our growth plans. Coupled with our dividends and through our share price performance, Sasol continues to create long-term shareholder value. \r\nWith that, we'd now be happy to open it up for any questions that you may have. Operator?",
      "transcript_text3": "Just 2 questions on Canada, please, on the shale gas, and then just one on the CapEx. Just looking on at the Canadian shale gas depreciation, it seems to have rolled over quite significantly in 2H relative to 1H. I wonder if you could just give us some kind of guidance for what we can expect for depreciation there on those Canadian gas assets. And then if you can give us also some kind of indication of what the book value of those Canadian assets are sitting at, at the moment? That's the first 2 questions. And then just the one on CapEx, I'm just wondering if you could break down that ZAR 65 billion FY '16 forecast for us just a little bit in terms of what is the ethane cracker, whether that's in those numbers or not, and what actually relates to, potentially, Mozambique as well.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Jarrett, for the 3 questions, and I think Paul's going to get all 3 of them. I could take a stab at the book value, but I'll let you do that.\n\n---\n\nAll right. Let's get the easy one out of the road. The book value is approximately CAD 1.1 billion. Basically, the depreciation charge, Jarrett, you have to view that over a financial year, very difficult to just figure down on one-off versus a second-off. So typically, the way that we look at it is roughly between CAD 200 million and CAD 230 million as a range that you can use for the 2015 financial year. Your capital estimate was for 2015, the ZAR 50 billion in terms of its makeup?\n\n---\n\nYes, he wanted detail on ZAR 65 billion for FY '16.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So basically, the ZAR 50 billion in terms of the makeup of 2015 is ZAR 20 billion in any given year for the next 2 financial years will relate to our sustenance program, of which the majority will be spent at Sasol Mining and Sasol Synfuels. In terms of the growth cost, the large portion of the growth charges will primarily be spent in the U.S, specifically on the cracker project and also on the FEED cost for the GTL. There will be also a portion being spent on the rigs that we currently have active in Canada and then also a portion relating to the PSA development in Mozambique.\n\n---\n\nAnd for '16 as well?\n\n---\n\nFor '16, it's pretty much the same in terms of the ratio. So the ZAR 65 billion, again, ZAR 20 billion will be spent on Sasol's capital, with the majority, then, being spent on the cracker and then on the FEED costs of the GTL. Those will be the 2 big projects, which we then will need to execute in the next 2 years.\n\n---\n\nThree questions, please. First of all, on the cost savings, on the ZAR 4 billion sustainable cost savings you're now talking about, can you give us any breakdown in terms of what the key components of those savings are? You mentioned, for example, in the savings you've already achieved, some impact of people costs and reduced external spend, but can you give us any idea on the ZAR 4 billion number? And then secondly, on the ethane cracker, and you talked a bit about your contracting strategy there. So are you concerned about CapEx inflation that we're seeing in North America at the moment, and what do you think the acceptable level of risk in terms of exposure to that inflation is for you in the ethane cracker project? And then just finally, if I read it correctly, I think you suffered 5 fatalities this year. And if you could tell us about those and what your plans are to reduce that level going forward?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Let's start with cost savings. Caroline, as you heard we've -- thanks for the questions. As you heard, we've increased the business performance enhancement programs target to at least ZAR 4 billion annually starting in FY '16, and we think there's also some upside to that as well. The breakdown of the various pockets, I think, you need to look at some headcount reduction. We've had workforce transitioned in the upper levels of our management structures, the top 4 levels of the company where we have transitioned primarily through voluntary retrenchments and voluntary early retirements. Those activities are ongoing and they will run through this financial year in other levels of the organization and in -- out in our facilities as well. But I will say that we do not expect to make any forced retrenchments of our monthly salaried personnel. Based on the numbers that we're expecting to transition, based, if you look at our -- the fact that we've frozen hiring and filling vacancies and attrition that we have in the company that's voluntary retrenchments, voluntary early retirements will take the vast majority of the workforce transition process. And looking at other pockets of savings, again, headcount is just a small portion of that. We need to look at operational productivity. That's going to be a big driver of the cost savings. That's one of the bigger buckets that you'll see, along with inbound supply chain spent. A huge amount of savings will be driven by our supply chain group in reducing our external spend. And then I think the other big bucket that you can count on is based on the new operating model and the structure of the company, where we're reducing our businesses down from 16 -- down to 16. We're also streamlining our functions. So we -- going forward, we will have fit-for-purpose functions supporting the businesses, and we expect to see a lot of the cost savings coming from the functional groups as well. On CapEx, we're in the final throes of the estimates on the cracker over in the U.S. and, like I said, we're looking at taking a final investment decision here before the end of the year. And I think I'll ask Steve Cornell, who is here with us today, to comment on your inflation question and how we're looking at that with respect to cost and schedule on the megaproject on the cracker. Steve?\n\n---\n\nCaroline, certainly, we have seen cost pressure as the other companies building similar type projects in the Gulf Coast have seen. We've got a number of actions that we've implemented to try to make sure that we're mitigating that. The mixed contracting strategy is one of those, as David has said. We're also making good use of the local Louisiana contractors. We have the luxury of being in the Louisiana area, and not necessarily right around the Houston area. So we have the ability to lock in a higher percentage of local contractors. And we do assume, in our cost estimate that we'll continue to see some of the impact of the heated market and wage rates. But really, the view generally is not as bad as once thought. We're seeing some pressure and we've allowed for some of that in the cost estimate, and we've done quite a bit of benchmarking on what our costs are in the different areas. And we benchmark really well. So we've got a lot of confidence on this. We've gone out for firm bids on a significant amount of the cost elements. So I think we're going to feel very good as we go forward to the board for a final approval before the end of the year.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Thanks, Steve. On the last question, on the fatalities. I'll give you some color on those first, and then talk a little bit about the way forward. Of the 5 -- and just remember this is coming from some numbers that were quite a bit higher in previous years. So we've been -- in the left few years we've been able to get down to 4 fatalities, 5 fatalities -- 4 to 5 fatalities in the last 3 years and we, obviously, are driving to 0 harm going forward and continue to. It is our #1 value of the company. Obviously, safety is first and foremost, and top of all our minds at all times. Of the 5 fatalities, 2 were I would not say directly operationally related. One was due to extreme weather that a windstorm had knocked a crane over after hours and unfortunately, we had one fatality with that crane that buckled on us. And one was a car accident of a sales executive in our old business, who was out on the public roads. The other 3: One was in Synfuels at the boiler station, where we were maintaining a boiler, and unfortunately we had some coal dust fall and that caused -- resulted in a fatality. Then finally, we had 2 surface mining incidents at Sasol Mining. One involving a reclaimed bucket -- rotating reclaimed bucket that caused a fatality and then finally, a conveyer incident. So those were the 5. Again, we are focused on 0 harm at the company, and we not only focus on our safety of personnel individually but also have a large, strong push on process safety because process safety management is extremely important, and that's where you can get very large incidents that can cause great numbers of fatalities. Our process safety management and our risk-based approach to safety is gaining good traction. And in fact, we've just reviewed with the board that risk-based safety approach on how we plan to roll out the top risks in safety across the group into the businesses. And from there, have them work through each of their specific top safety risks in each of the operating hubs and businesses, and make sure that we have the -- not only the preventive controls in place for each of those types of incidents, but also the corrective controls on the back end as well. So a lot going on in safety as it always has in Sasol, and we continue to up our game. And we believe that, that risk-based safety approach is, as we're told, best-in-class and right up there with the best industry peers, major peers in oil, gas and petrochemicals. So thanks for those 3 questions.\n\n---\n\nJust coming back to the CapEx. The CapEx guidance for the next couple of years, could you maybe just indicate if that -- what of Clean Fuels II, the Clean Fuels II project that includes and where do we stand with that project? Secondly, I guess I have to ask this question around Synfuels production. You've had the big shutdown and still, you're fairly conservative on production next year. Why is that, if the shutdown doesn't repeat? And I guess, for me, the ultimate question is then what is Synfuels' sustainable production in the long run? And then lastly, I see a picture of a head office in Houston. Are you building a new head office in Houston as well?\n\n---\n\nSure. Thanks, Gerhard. Let's start with CapEx guidance and then I'll ask Bernard to talk to the Synfuels production and not having a total shutdown this year and how that's -- how we're thinking about that? And I'll be happy to answer the Houston question for you. So Paul, on CapEx?\n\n---\n\nYes. So basically, Gerhard we are providing capital guidance as usual only for 2 years going out. Specifically with regard to your question on Clean Fuels II. As you know, it has been postponed and ultimately, we are currently also assessing what the impact of that is on our capital plans. We have included a very small amount for Clean Fuels in the next 2 years' estimate.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And Bernard, we're guiding 7.5 million to 7.6 million tons in FY '15. We did 7.6 million tons in FY '14, so can we talk a lot bit more about what we're seeing out there?\n\n---\n\nAll right. Thanks, David. Gerhard, as you know, since 2011, we have set unrelenting focus to create a stable and predictable platform and to deliver on the FEED purchase growth promise, and this has been achieved and we've seen the volumes go up from 7,1 billion to 7,6 billion tons last year, notwithstanding the total shutdown. You'll remember that in this year, we still have a big shutdown although it's only a phase shutdown. But notwithstanding that, we've created the new norm or the new platform, if you like, which is this band between 7,5 and 7,6. And the primary focus now is to maintain the stability and the predictability that we've been able to achieve over the last 5 years or 3 years. And we also want to support a producer plan philosophy, which will look to optimize the fuels chemical mix as we move forward, and also respond to the '95 demand in the 95-93 debate. Over the next year or 2, we will establish the new bottlenecks for this new norm, this platform that we have now and that will inform the guidance going forward. But for now, it's important for us to maximize throughput without chasing production records and to utilize this stable and predictable platform that we have created.\n\n---\n\nCan I just ask on that? So the conclusion of the natural gas growth project, you don't see any real benefits from that in the immediate future then?\n\n---\n\nGerhard, I think there may be upside potential but we'll evaluate during the next cycle to see what other bottlenecks have been created by running at these levels because, I mean, we are running at really high levels for the unit.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Thanks, Bernard. On the question of the head office in Houston. If you take a look at Slide 5 there, Gerhard, we've put the titles in on the pictures as Sasol's global headquarters in Johannesburg and Sasol's North American head offices. So clearly, our global headquarters are being built here in Stanton, that will be able to take 3,400 people. We're consolidating 17 buildings into 1 to be much more efficient and productive and looking forward to moving into that global headquarters here in Johannesburg in late 2016. So over in Houston, that's our head office, that's where Steve works out of and that's our -- going to be our new head office in Houston. That will currently house about 350 people and ramp up to approximately 600 or thereabouts as we go into our growth program and build up the projects there. So that's the answer on Houston. Thanks for the questions.\n\n---\n\nJust 2 things from my side. The one is just, you talk about your strategy focusing on Southern Africa and North America. Can you maybe just chat about how Uzbekistan puts into that? Maybe just give us an update as well on Uzbekistan as you've been pretty quiet on the result commentary on that? And just the second thing, just on the cost savings. I mean, we do see a bit of a moving target. Previously, you were talking about ZAR 3 billion and some upside to that and now ZAR 4 billion and further upside to that. In my understanding, it's a lot of upfront work and even the new operating structure is in place. So when will you have this confidence to actually give us a final number in terms of what that cost savings would be?\n\n---\n\nSure. Thanks, Nishal, for the questions. I'll take Uzbekistan and maybe you can talk about how we plan to go forward on the Phoenix cost savings. As we talked about it in our presentation today, we've had a two-pronged dual regional strategy at the company focusing on Southern Africa and then North America and expanding the current business activities in Louisiana. Uzbekistan, UGTL is -- as you know, we are looking for another equity partner. We are taking our share from 44.5% down to 25.5%, and the joint venture is looking for another partner for that 19%. There's discussions ongoing as we speak and that potential is still there as a possibility. The feed package, all the technical aspects of the project are basically complete, the estimate's done. You have an EPC contractor ready to go, but it's a matter of finding this additional partner and also closing financing on the project. So that's where we are at on UGTL right now, and I think we'll probably have more to say about that later in the year and into -- probably later in the year, I would think. So that's where that stands. On cost savings and how that's coming along, we continue to see positive savings flowing through. Paul, how would you want to answer that?\n\n---\n\nNishal, we basically at half year indicated that at least ZAR 3 billion, and then we'll update the market once we get better confirmation. As you can appreciate, this project is a 3-year project, and as you move through the different stages of which not only management is one stage, these various projects that we are focusing at, that contributes to towards the ZAR 4 billion. We are currently now in the phase of confirming all the different process improvements and the changes required on the streams for productivity improvement, as well as the inbound supply chain. Those are big streams in the overall benefit delivery and, in a couple of months, we will get clear confirmation on that, and then we will -- that will put us in a position to communicate to the market. I think what you also have to bear in mind and I have stated it this morning, that there is some uncertainty with regards to electricity price increases going forward in South Africa, and we also want to kind of get a view on that and ascertain how  that will affect our savings plans before putting out a final number in the market. Surely the market can appreciate the step change to ZAR 4 billion, which we believe is a real stretch to the organization. But once you've got better clarity, we will definitely communicate further upside savings to the markets.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Paul. Thanks, Nishal. Operator, we've got time for a couple of more questions.\n\n---\n\nA couple of quick questions, please. Was I right in understanding that you said there was going to be no compulsory retrenchments? I find that slightly surprising out of 34,000 people. Maybe you could explain how that works when you've indicated you're going to contract down the number of businesses and divisions that you've got, and what happens to people if they're job no longer exists within the new structure? That's the first question. Secondly, just perhaps you could elaborate on how some of your term contracts for the ethane cracker, what sort of shape they might take? And just to confirm one other thing. I think you said the dividend was ZAR 20.5 and then the tax, I think, is ZAR 21. So maybe you could just confirm -- sorry, ZAR 21.5, confirm what the dividend actually is?\n\n---\n\nWell we can clear that last thing up right now. I'm sorry, if we said 20.5, it is ZAR 21.50, up 13% on ZAR 19 last year. That's the -- we definitely want to get that correct. Let's talk about -- just to clarify for you, Alex. Just the work force transition process, a large part of our focus in work force transition has been in the staff, in the home offices and on the staffing side, managed primarily, like I said, the top 4 levels of the company is what we've been working on so far. We're now down into the GEC 4 levels, so that's 5 levels down and we're working on that now. So most of the retrenchments -- and again, we follow a voluntary retrenchment, voluntary early retirement and last line of defense, if you will, is forced retrenchments, which is what you're speaking to. We have not seen a lot of those yet and my comment was specific on no forced retrenchments, specific to our union labor employees. Based on the demographics of what we see here in South Africa with more than 2,500 of our union colleagues above the age of 55, we're going to see quite a bit of voluntary early retirements in that space and probably more than what we need to transition. So we need to be very careful from a retention standpoint to keep our colleagues gainfully employed where we need them to be employed. We're also going to be doing quite a bit of redeployment in the monthly salaried employees or the union colleagues. We'll be able to move them around into different parts of the business as well, where, as you know, we have a moratorium on hiring. We've frozen hiring since January of 2013. So the vacancies are still there, and we have quite a bit of attrition in the company that has been building up since we started Phoenix or since we started the enhancement program. So I think from that standpoint, the comment was specific to forced retrenchments at the union colleague level. So hopefully, that answers the question. Over on the term contracts for ethane, I think right now we've got 70% of our ethane requirements under term contracts. I'll ask Steve to give us a little more color on spot percentages and what's outstanding and left to be signed up on the term side, and also talk a little bit about transportation in the various pipelines we've got so that we can play the suppliers off and make sure we're getting the best deal for ourselves.\n\n---\n\nAlex, we need about 100,000 barrels a day of ethane to supply the 1.5 million ton ethylene cracker. As David said, we have term contracts in place for 70,000 barrels of that. Those are 3- to 5-year terms and most of the contracts are tied to an OPIS price for ethane. A small amount is tied to, actually, a natural gas, Henry Hub posting. We do plan to put about 30% -- to get about 30% or 30,000 barrels a day on spot. And due to the liquidity of the market in the Gulf Coast, that gives us the ability to play the market and take advantage of the volatile nature of the market at times. And we have also contracted for storage capacity so that we can store some for both shutdowns and to take advantage of attractive pricing. And that transportation, we've got firm transportation to allow us to get the ethane all the way from Mont Belvieu over to the cracker. So I think we're in great shape in terms of both the transportation needs and, actually, the molecules themselves.\n\n---\n\nCan I -- sorry, could I just ask one further question? When you say it's tied to the OPIS price, you basically mean that it's pretty flexible then? It's not a fixed-price contract?\n\n---\n\nThat's correct. The majority of it is an OPIS price. It's not a fixed price.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I think we've got time for the last question, please, from, I think, Citi.\n\n---\n\nJust a quick one on how you -- where you have the opportunities for U.S. GTL and Mozambican GTL? You seem to be pretty optimistic about the U.S., et cetera. I guess it will, in time, become either/or as you probably won't have the financial power to go for both. So how do you think about the timing of pushing either/or of these projects forward?\n\n---\n\nGreat. Thanks, Johann. We, obviously, right now are focused on the U.S. GTL, which is in -- the furthest along as it's in FEEDs, front-end engineering design, right now with one of our main GTL contractors. And the way you can look at it and think about timing is we still expect to take a final investment decision on that U.S. GTL plant, call it, 96,000 barrels a day plus up to 10% additional capacity, 24 months after we take the cracker decision. So you can think about late 2016 before we take a U.S. GTL decision. And obviously, that will take into account the microeconomics at that time and the cost estimates and schedules that we'll be developing over this -- during the FEED phase. In addition to your Mozambique -- you've talked about the Mozambique GTL. You'll remember that we also have a feasibility study completed on our Canada GTL. So it also features in this mix. It also has good economics and is in the pipeline to be considered in the early part of the next decade. So I think as we get later into the decade and we start seeing what the pre-feasibility study in Mozambique looks like with our partners over there, plus with the government and with Eni, we'll take a look at that and go through our prioritization process, look at the rolling capital plan. And as you say, we'll have to carefully consider our gearing and our CapEx requirements and the buffer for volatility and our progressive dividend, which we continue to focus on and take decisions on all the GTL opportunities later in the decade. So I think that's how you should look at it, in that order. And with that, I want to thank everyone for joining us today and I look forward to visiting with many or most of you during our upcoming investor and analyst roadshows over the next few weeks. \r\nSo thanks again, and we'll see you soon.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Jarrett Geldenhuys (Analysts)】\nJust 2 questions on Canada, please, on the shale gas, and then just one on the CapEx. Just looking on at the Canadian shale gas depreciation, it seems to have rolled over quite significantly in 2H relative to 1H. I wonder if you could just give us some kind of guidance for what we can expect for depreciation there on those Canadian gas assets. And then if you can give us also some kind of indication of what the book value of those Canadian assets are sitting at, at the moment? That's the first 2 questions. And then just the one on CapEx, I'm just wondering if you could break down that ZAR 65 billion FY '16 forecast for us just a little bit in terms of what is the ethane cracker, whether that's in those numbers or not, and what actually relates to, potentially, Mozambique as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nThanks, Jarrett, for the 3 questions, and I think Paul's going to get all 3 of them. I could take a stab at the book value, but I'll let you do that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Victor (Executives)】\nAll right. Let's get the easy one out of the road. The book value is approximately CAD 1.1 billion. Basically, the depreciation charge, Jarrett, you have to view that over a financial year, very difficult to just figure down on one-off versus a second-off. So typically, the way that we look at it is roughly between CAD 200 million and CAD 230 million as a range that you can use for the 2015 financial year. Your capital estimate was for 2015, the ZAR 50 billion in terms of its makeup?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nYes, he wanted detail on ZAR 65 billion for FY '16.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Victor (Executives)】\nOkay. So basically, the ZAR 50 billion in terms of the makeup of 2015 is ZAR 20 billion in any given year for the next 2 financial years will relate to our sustenance program, of which the majority will be spent at Sasol Mining and Sasol Synfuels. In terms of the growth cost, the large portion of the growth charges will primarily be spent in the U.S, specifically on the cracker project and also on the FEED cost for the GTL. There will be also a portion being spent on the rigs that we currently have active in Canada and then also a portion relating to the PSA development in Mozambique.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nAnd for '16 as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Victor (Executives)】\nFor '16, it's pretty much the same in terms of the ratio. So the ZAR 65 billion, again, ZAR 20 billion will be spent on Sasol's capital, with the majority, then, being spent on the cracker and then on the FEED costs of the GTL. Those will be the 2 big projects, which we then will need to execute in the next 2 years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Caroline Learmonth (Analysts)】\nThree questions, please. First of all, on the cost savings, on the ZAR 4 billion sustainable cost savings you're now talking about, can you give us any breakdown in terms of what the key components of those savings are? You mentioned, for example, in the savings you've already achieved, some impact of people costs and reduced external spend, but can you give us any idea on the ZAR 4 billion number? And then secondly, on the ethane cracker, and you talked a bit about your contracting strategy there. So are you concerned about CapEx inflation that we're seeing in North America at the moment, and what do you think the acceptable level of risk in terms of exposure to that inflation is for you in the ethane cracker project? And then just finally, if I read it correctly, I think you suffered 5 fatalities this year. And if you could tell us about those and what your plans are to reduce that level going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nOkay. Let's start with cost savings. Caroline, as you heard we've -- thanks for the questions. As you heard, we've increased the business performance enhancement programs target to at least ZAR 4 billion annually starting in FY '16, and we think there's also some upside to that as well. The breakdown of the various pockets, I think, you need to look at some headcount reduction. We've had workforce transitioned in the upper levels of our management structures, the top 4 levels of the company where we have transitioned primarily through voluntary retrenchments and voluntary early retirements. Those activities are ongoing and they will run through this financial year in other levels of the organization and in -- out in our facilities as well. But I will say that we do not expect to make any forced retrenchments of our monthly salaried personnel. Based on the numbers that we're expecting to transition, based, if you look at our -- the fact that we've frozen hiring and filling vacancies and attrition that we have in the company that's voluntary retrenchments, voluntary early retirements will take the vast majority of the workforce transition process. And looking at other pockets of savings, again, headcount is just a small portion of that. We need to look at operational productivity. That's going to be a big driver of the cost savings. That's one of the bigger buckets that you'll see, along with inbound supply chain spent. A huge amount of savings will be driven by our supply chain group in reducing our external spend. And then I think the other big bucket that you can count on is based on the new operating model and the structure of the company, where we're reducing our businesses down from 16 -- down to 16. We're also streamlining our functions. So we -- going forward, we will have fit-for-purpose functions supporting the businesses, and we expect to see a lot of the cost savings coming from the functional groups as well. On CapEx, we're in the final throes of the estimates on the cracker over in the U.S. and, like I said, we're looking at taking a final investment decision here before the end of the year. And I think I'll ask Steve Cornell, who is here with us today, to comment on your inflation question and how we're looking at that with respect to cost and schedule on the megaproject on the cracker. Steve?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Cornell (Executives)】\nCaroline, certainly, we have seen cost pressure as the other companies building similar type projects in the Gulf Coast have seen. We've got a number of actions that we've implemented to try to make sure that we're mitigating that. The mixed contracting strategy is one of those, as David has said. We're also making good use of the local Louisiana contractors. We have the luxury of being in the Louisiana area, and not necessarily right around the Houston area. So we have the ability to lock in a higher percentage of local contractors. And we do assume, in our cost estimate that we'll continue to see some of the impact of the heated market and wage rates. But really, the view generally is not as bad as once thought. We're seeing some pressure and we've allowed for some of that in the cost estimate, and we've done quite a bit of benchmarking on what our costs are in the different areas. And we benchmark really well. So we've got a lot of confidence on this. We've gone out for firm bids on a significant amount of the cost elements. So I think we're going to feel very good as we go forward to the board for a final approval before the end of the year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nGreat. Thanks, Steve. On the last question, on the fatalities. I'll give you some color on those first, and then talk a little bit about the way forward. Of the 5 -- and just remember this is coming from some numbers that were quite a bit higher in previous years. So we've been -- in the left few years we've been able to get down to 4 fatalities, 5 fatalities -- 4 to 5 fatalities in the last 3 years and we, obviously, are driving to 0 harm going forward and continue to. It is our #1 value of the company. Obviously, safety is first and foremost, and top of all our minds at all times. Of the 5 fatalities, 2 were I would not say directly operationally related. One was due to extreme weather that a windstorm had knocked a crane over after hours and unfortunately, we had one fatality with that crane that buckled on us. And one was a car accident of a sales executive in our old business, who was out on the public roads. The other 3: One was in Synfuels at the boiler station, where we were maintaining a boiler, and unfortunately we had some coal dust fall and that caused -- resulted in a fatality. Then finally, we had 2 surface mining incidents at Sasol Mining. One involving a reclaimed bucket -- rotating reclaimed bucket that caused a fatality and then finally, a conveyer incident. So those were the 5. Again, we are focused on 0 harm at the company, and we not only focus on our safety of personnel individually but also have a large, strong push on process safety because process safety management is extremely important, and that's where you can get very large incidents that can cause great numbers of fatalities. Our process safety management and our risk-based approach to safety is gaining good traction. And in fact, we've just reviewed with the board that risk-based safety approach on how we plan to roll out the top risks in safety across the group into the businesses. And from there, have them work through each of their specific top safety risks in each of the operating hubs and businesses, and make sure that we have the -- not only the preventive controls in place for each of those types of incidents, but also the corrective controls on the back end as well. So a lot going on in safety as it always has in Sasol, and we continue to up our game. And we believe that, that risk-based safety approach is, as we're told, best-in-class and right up there with the best industry peers, major peers in oil, gas and petrochemicals. So thanks for those 3 questions.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gerhard Engelbrecht (Analysts)】\nJust coming back to the CapEx. The CapEx guidance for the next couple of years, could you maybe just indicate if that -- what of Clean Fuels II, the Clean Fuels II project that includes and where do we stand with that project? Secondly, I guess I have to ask this question around Synfuels production. You've had the big shutdown and still, you're fairly conservative on production next year. Why is that, if the shutdown doesn't repeat? And I guess, for me, the ultimate question is then what is Synfuels' sustainable production in the long run? And then lastly, I see a picture of a head office in Houston. Are you building a new head office in Houston as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nSure. Thanks, Gerhard. Let's start with CapEx guidance and then I'll ask Bernard to talk to the Synfuels production and not having a total shutdown this year and how that's -- how we're thinking about that? And I'll be happy to answer the Houston question for you. So Paul, on CapEx?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Victor (Executives)】\nYes. So basically, Gerhard we are providing capital guidance as usual only for 2 years going out. Specifically with regard to your question on Clean Fuels II. As you know, it has been postponed and ultimately, we are currently also assessing what the impact of that is on our capital plans. We have included a very small amount for Clean Fuels in the next 2 years' estimate.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nOkay. And Bernard, we're guiding 7.5 million to 7.6 million tons in FY '15. We did 7.6 million tons in FY '14, so can we talk a lot bit more about what we're seeing out there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Bernard Ekhard Klingenberg (Executives)】\nAll right. Thanks, David. Gerhard, as you know, since 2011, we have set unrelenting focus to create a stable and predictable platform and to deliver on the FEED purchase growth promise, and this has been achieved and we've seen the volumes go up from 7,1 billion to 7,6 billion tons last year, notwithstanding the total shutdown. You'll remember that in this year, we still have a big shutdown although it's only a phase shutdown. But notwithstanding that, we've created the new norm or the new platform, if you like, which is this band between 7,5 and 7,6. And the primary focus now is to maintain the stability and the predictability that we've been able to achieve over the last 5 years or 3 years. And we also want to support a producer plan philosophy, which will look to optimize the fuels chemical mix as we move forward, and also respond to the '95 demand in the 95-93 debate. Over the next year or 2, we will establish the new bottlenecks for this new norm, this platform that we have now and that will inform the guidance going forward. But for now, it's important for us to maximize throughput without chasing production records and to utilize this stable and predictable platform that we have created.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gerhard Engelbrecht (Analysts)】\nCan I just ask on that? So the conclusion of the natural gas growth project, you don't see any real benefits from that in the immediate future then?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Bernard Ekhard Klingenberg (Executives)】\nGerhard, I think there may be upside potential but we'll evaluate during the next cycle to see what other bottlenecks have been created by running at these levels because, I mean, we are running at really high levels for the unit.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nGreat. Thanks, Bernard. On the question of the head office in Houston. If you take a look at Slide 5 there, Gerhard, we've put the titles in on the pictures as Sasol's global headquarters in Johannesburg and Sasol's North American head offices. So clearly, our global headquarters are being built here in Stanton, that will be able to take 3,400 people. We're consolidating 17 buildings into 1 to be much more efficient and productive and looking forward to moving into that global headquarters here in Johannesburg in late 2016. So over in Houston, that's our head office, that's where Steve works out of and that's our -- going to be our new head office in Houston. That will currently house about 350 people and ramp up to approximately 600 or thereabouts as we go into our growth program and build up the projects there. So that's the answer on Houston. Thanks for the questions.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nishal Ramloutan (Analysts)】\nJust 2 things from my side. The one is just, you talk about your strategy focusing on Southern Africa and North America. Can you maybe just chat about how Uzbekistan puts into that? Maybe just give us an update as well on Uzbekistan as you've been pretty quiet on the result commentary on that? And just the second thing, just on the cost savings. I mean, we do see a bit of a moving target. Previously, you were talking about ZAR 3 billion and some upside to that and now ZAR 4 billion and further upside to that. In my understanding, it's a lot of upfront work and even the new operating structure is in place. So when will you have this confidence to actually give us a final number in terms of what that cost savings would be?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nSure. Thanks, Nishal, for the questions. I'll take Uzbekistan and maybe you can talk about how we plan to go forward on the Phoenix cost savings. As we talked about it in our presentation today, we've had a two-pronged dual regional strategy at the company focusing on Southern Africa and then North America and expanding the current business activities in Louisiana. Uzbekistan, UGTL is -- as you know, we are looking for another equity partner. We are taking our share from 44.5% down to 25.5%, and the joint venture is looking for another partner for that 19%. There's discussions ongoing as we speak and that potential is still there as a possibility. The feed package, all the technical aspects of the project are basically complete, the estimate's done. You have an EPC contractor ready to go, but it's a matter of finding this additional partner and also closing financing on the project. So that's where we are at on UGTL right now, and I think we'll probably have more to say about that later in the year and into -- probably later in the year, I would think. So that's where that stands. On cost savings and how that's coming along, we continue to see positive savings flowing through. Paul, how would you want to answer that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Victor (Executives)】\nNishal, we basically at half year indicated that at least ZAR 3 billion, and then we'll update the market once we get better confirmation. As you can appreciate, this project is a 3-year project, and as you move through the different stages of which not only management is one stage, these various projects that we are focusing at, that contributes to towards the ZAR 4 billion. We are currently now in the phase of confirming all the different process improvements and the changes required on the streams for productivity improvement, as well as the inbound supply chain. Those are big streams in the overall benefit delivery and, in a couple of months, we will get clear confirmation on that, and then we will -- that will put us in a position to communicate to the market. I think what you also have to bear in mind and I have stated it this morning, that there is some uncertainty with regards to electricity price increases going forward in South Africa, and we also want to kind of get a view on that and ascertain how  that will affect our savings plans before putting out a final number in the market. Surely the market can appreciate the step change to ZAR 4 billion, which we believe is a real stretch to the organization. But once you've got better clarity, we will definitely communicate further upside savings to the markets.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nThanks, Paul. Thanks, Nishal. Operator, we've got time for a couple of more questions.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alex Comer (Analysts)】\nA couple of quick questions, please. Was I right in understanding that you said there was going to be no compulsory retrenchments? I find that slightly surprising out of 34,000 people. Maybe you could explain how that works when you've indicated you're going to contract down the number of businesses and divisions that you've got, and what happens to people if they're job no longer exists within the new structure? That's the first question. Secondly, just perhaps you could elaborate on how some of your term contracts for the ethane cracker, what sort of shape they might take? And just to confirm one other thing. I think you said the dividend was ZAR 20.5 and then the tax, I think, is ZAR 21. So maybe you could just confirm -- sorry, ZAR 21.5, confirm what the dividend actually is?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nWell we can clear that last thing up right now. I'm sorry, if we said 20.5, it is ZAR 21.50, up 13% on ZAR 19 last year. That's the -- we definitely want to get that correct. Let's talk about -- just to clarify for you, Alex. Just the work force transition process, a large part of our focus in work force transition has been in the staff, in the home offices and on the staffing side, managed primarily, like I said, the top 4 levels of the company is what we've been working on so far. We're now down into the GEC 4 levels, so that's 5 levels down and we're working on that now. So most of the retrenchments -- and again, we follow a voluntary retrenchment, voluntary early retirement and last line of defense, if you will, is forced retrenchments, which is what you're speaking to. We have not seen a lot of those yet and my comment was specific on no forced retrenchments, specific to our union labor employees. Based on the demographics of what we see here in South Africa with more than 2,500 of our union colleagues above the age of 55, we're going to see quite a bit of voluntary early retirements in that space and probably more than what we need to transition. So we need to be very careful from a retention standpoint to keep our colleagues gainfully employed where we need them to be employed. We're also going to be doing quite a bit of redeployment in the monthly salaried employees or the union colleagues. We'll be able to move them around into different parts of the business as well, where, as you know, we have a moratorium on hiring. We've frozen hiring since January of 2013. So the vacancies are still there, and we have quite a bit of attrition in the company that has been building up since we started Phoenix or since we started the enhancement program. So I think from that standpoint, the comment was specific to forced retrenchments at the union colleague level. So hopefully, that answers the question. Over on the term contracts for ethane, I think right now we've got 70% of our ethane requirements under term contracts. I'll ask Steve to give us a little more color on spot percentages and what's outstanding and left to be signed up on the term side, and also talk a little bit about transportation in the various pipelines we've got so that we can play the suppliers off and make sure we're getting the best deal for ourselves.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Cornell (Executives)】\nAlex, we need about 100,000 barrels a day of ethane to supply the 1.5 million ton ethylene cracker. As David said, we have term contracts in place for 70,000 barrels of that. Those are 3- to 5-year terms and most of the contracts are tied to an OPIS price for ethane. A small amount is tied to, actually, a natural gas, Henry Hub posting. We do plan to put about 30% -- to get about 30% or 30,000 barrels a day on spot. And due to the liquidity of the market in the Gulf Coast, that gives us the ability to play the market and take advantage of the volatile nature of the market at times. And we have also contracted for storage capacity so that we can store some for both shutdowns and to take advantage of attractive pricing. And that transportation, we've got firm transportation to allow us to get the ethane all the way from Mont Belvieu over to the cracker. So I think we're in great shape in terms of both the transportation needs and, actually, the molecules themselves.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alex Comer (Analysts)】\nCan I -- sorry, could I just ask one further question? When you say it's tied to the OPIS price, you basically mean that it's pretty flexible then? It's not a fixed-price contract?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Cornell (Executives)】\nThat's correct. The majority of it is an OPIS price. It's not a fixed price.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nOkay. I think we've got time for the last question, please, from, I think, Citi.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Johann Steyn (Analysts)】\nJust a quick one on how you -- where you have the opportunities for U.S. GTL and Mozambican GTL? You seem to be pretty optimistic about the U.S., et cetera. I guess it will, in time, become either/or as you probably won't have the financial power to go for both. So how do you think about the timing of pushing either/or of these projects forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nGreat. Thanks, Johann. We, obviously, right now are focused on the U.S. GTL, which is in -- the furthest along as it's in FEEDs, front-end engineering design, right now with one of our main GTL contractors. And the way you can look at it and think about timing is we still expect to take a final investment decision on that U.S. GTL plant, call it, 96,000 barrels a day plus up to 10% additional capacity, 24 months after we take the cracker decision. So you can think about late 2016 before we take a U.S. GTL decision. And obviously, that will take into account the microeconomics at that time and the cost estimates and schedules that we'll be developing over this -- during the FEED phase. In addition to your Mozambique -- you've talked about the Mozambique GTL. You'll remember that we also have a feasibility study completed on our Canada GTL. So it also features in this mix. It also has good economics and is in the pipeline to be considered in the early part of the next decade. So I think as we get later into the decade and we start seeing what the pre-feasibility study in Mozambique looks like with our partners over there, plus with the government and with Eni, we'll take a look at that and go through our prioritization process, look at the rolling capital plan. And as you say, we'll have to carefully consider our gearing and our CapEx requirements and the buffer for volatility and our progressive dividend, which we continue to focus on and take decisions on all the GTL opportunities later in the decade. So I think that's how you should look at it, in that order. And with that, I want to thank everyone for joining us today and I look forward to visiting with many or most of you during our upcoming investor and analyst roadshows over the next few weeks. \r\nSo thanks again, and we'll see you soon.",

      "transcript_text1": "Welcome to our interim results presentation. As has become customary, we do it here in Johannesburg. More interest, more money here in Johannesburg. \r\nBefore we start with the presentation, I'd like to welcome a few people specifically. First, some board members. Chairman Desmond Smith; Philip Rademeyer; Paul Bradshaw, one of our directors from the U.K.; Kobus Möller, our Financial Director, who will talk about the financials just now; Yegs Ramiah; Ian Kirk; Themba Gamedze; Yaganthrie Ramiah; Andre Zeeman, who will do the actuarial questions later on, help us with that; some of our business people; and then a whole lot of our analysts and others who support us. Welcome. It's our pleasure to share with you another set of 6 months results. \r\nThe agenda is straightforward. We will start off with talking a little bit about the economy, the operating environment, what is happening and how it's impacting us. Talk about our strategy in Sanlam, how we're trying to run the business to take advantage out of the markets. Kobus Möller, the Financial Director, will come and give us the financial review, and I will end off with a few points on what we're going to concentrate on for the rest of year, what the outlook is and so forth. \r\nStarting off with the operating environment. I think the overriding thing that we see is the fundamentals, and particularly our major market, South Africa, are weak. So if we really look at things, it is challenging operating conditions, slow growth in global demand, weak economic growth in South Africa combined with industrial action over the past 6 months, and particularly the platinum mines that hurt us, and by and large and increasingly, we see the South African consumer being under pressure. \r\nIn the South African economy, we will have a few slides to show how we're doing and with respect to growth, interest rates, equity markets and currencies, and we'll also remark briefly on what is happening elsewhere in the economy. But if you really look at growth, you can see that growth is not going back to the levels that we've seen sort of 10 years ago, 8, 10 years ago, but we're sort of plodding along at around 2% and a bit -- a little bit below that. And that is not great. It isn't when you talk to -- particularly the investors from the U.S. and Europe, they're worried about it. And as we can see, there's a lot of pressure in our own economy. \r\nIf we look at interest rates, we can see the long-term rate, the 9-year bond rate that we use, by and large, to value our business. You can see that has gone up by about 70 basis points. And of course, because we use that as the discount rate, it had a negative effect on the value of new business to the tune of about 4%, so -- but we were under pressure with the volumes as well. The new business margin went down a little bit because of the higher discount rate. The short-term rate sort of very much the same, if we compared it to the 2 halves from 2013 to now. \r\nIf we look at the bond -- the equity market, it's done pretty well. And because we get the equities, the higher levels actually caused particular investment businesses to do substantially better. You can see the markets were about 11% higher and that has made a big impact for us on the bond market, the returns were 3.4%, which is also substantially better than the previous period. So overall, if we look at the market, a positive effect on our results. \r\nSimilarly with the exchange rate. The exchange rate has weakened quite a bit and that has had positive effects from the income that we've seen, particularly from Europe -- European operations and the U.K., we see that on a period -- of the 2 periods that we're comparing, exchange rate weakened by 26% so of course, the result from the U.K. would be higher. You see the U.S. rate there, Botswana also positively impacted. India and the Rest of Africa, particularly because of what's happening in Ghana, the effect is fairly neutral. But overall, you can see a 5% better result coming from exchange rate movements. New business volumes a 2% effect, on the value of new business a 1% positive effect. \r\nSo the economy. If we look at the economy in more detail, one of our bigger operations in Botswana, I think we're -- results were bolstered by a fairly resilient economy and a consumer base that is on the up. They've struggled for 1 year or 2 years, but I think the economy is well managed and they're doing well. If you look at the Rest of Africa, the GDB growth prospects exceed  South Africa despite slow global -- slow growth in global demand. The Ghana economy is struggling, particularly because of high inflation, devaluation of the currency and so forth. High growth rate, but once you look at the real rates, it is a bit under pressure. In India, we've had a below-trend economic growth, but I think a very buoyant equity market with Modi winning the elections there, being very pro-business, a lot of that has flowed through into the equity markets. And these markets have done extremely well, not only stopping at half year end, 30th of June, but running well into August and even now into September. And in Malaysia, I think the growth prospects remain in place. The economy is doing fairly well. The ringgit is holding up well as a currency. And particularly at that lower end of the market where we're playing, we see a quite substantial growth. So overall, things are fairly positive. \r\nSo from the economy, tough in South Africa, more positive signs elsewhere. Currency helping us, high markets helping us, higher interest rates, particularly in the long term impacting negatively on our results. Within this framework, if you look out a little bit about what our strategy is, nothing much has remained. We'd still focus on returns being the major driver and measurement of our success; return on group embedded value, as we measure it; big focus on the growth component, trying to maintain South Africa; get positive growth from pockets where there is still money to be made, but then trying to get into the higher growth areas offshore into Africa, India, Southeast Asia and also the developed markets in the U.K. in particular, trying to drive new business flows, diversification, operational efficiency. \r\nAgain, the second pillar of our strategy is around capital efficiency. We were able to do quite a bit around that. And going into SAM, I think we're well placed to sort of capitalize on 1 or 2 opportunities that has become available. \r\nSo if you look at the core strategy, about 75%, 80% of our business in South Africa. It's key that we get that to work. We look at lower growth but really focus on sustainability within the businesses. It's much more focused on efficiency and so forth, really getting the returns up, trying to do more with clients and so not trying to add a massive number of new businesses, but trying to do more with clients and so forth. And then through the mechanism of capital management, trying to build a future for us into the higher growth areas, particularly the African markets, the Anglophone African markets, the lower end of the market in India, Southeast Asia, Malaysia and others. \r\nAnd also at the high end of the market, trying to capitalize into the opportunities that we see for our clients into places like the U.K, diversifying portfolios and so forth. And by putting all of that together, you get sort of a blended growth. In South Africa, much more stable type of an environment, giving us 12, 13 sort of a percent. Offshore, higher growth, 30% and higher. Lower penetration, less competition. And by putting those 2 things together, you can get to around 16%, 17% in the shorter term. In the longer term, around 15%, which is what we're trying to achieve. So trying to get to around 10% sort of double-digit real growth into the future. \r\nIf you look at the actual results, I think some of the highlights there, the -- certainly, in my mind, the major highlight is the net operating profit per share that increased by 43%. Now that's off the back of most of the businesses working well. Kobus will talk about that a bit later. Santam coming back to the party, having had a difficult year in 2013. They've done pretty well this year. The higher asset base helping Sanlam Investments. Personal individual business, Sanlam Personal Finance, doing very well, and I think a particularly good performance from our Emerging Markets business. We did buy some new businesses, but even when you strip that out, 36% growth in the net operating profit x acquisitions, so a very, very solid base going forward. \r\nIf you look at business volumes, we can see some of the pressure coming through. New business volumes increased by 8% to ZAR 82 billion. That's excluding white label. Our net fund flows were ZAR 19 billion. It's up 40%. We are able to retain more money within the business. Net life value of new business, 7% up to ZAR 600-odd million. I'll talk to 1 or 2 areas where we struggled a little bit and Kobus will show you, coming from the strikes and so forth. Since normalization there, we're sort of back to normal. But the higher discount rate set -- knocked that number by about 4%. \r\nOur net value of new business margin around 2.68.  On most of the products, we've been able to maintain our margin, but our mix hurt us a little bit. And the Group Equity Value of ZAR 42.77 per share. Remember, we pay dividends once a year. The dividend got paid this year, so it's tough to grow the Group Equity Value during the first half. Most of the growth comes in the second half. \r\nAnd if we really look at the annualized return on group embedded value, actual number around 18% against a target that is substantially lower, just above 12%. But on an adjusted basis, if you normalize for the markets that's done particularly well, we're at that level of about 15% that we would like to be at. So plan -- everything is sort of going, by and large, according to plan. \r\nIf you really look at the operational efficiencies, the growth stays intact. We've been able to take Sanlam from a fairly stagnant business, not growing, to a business where the value of new business is now at least expected to be well over ZAR 1 billion on an annualized basis. For the half year, we've done pretty well. You can see how particularly the Emerging Markets have done well, and you can also see the majority coming through in the South African base and the strikes hindering us in the growth area, the lower end of the market in South Africa really putting some lid on the South African growth. But most of the businesses outside of the country growing fairly well. \r\nIf we look at persistency, we're very happy that the persistency is still well within the assumption base. But as the consumer is under pressure, and particularly in the platinum area and a few things, we see the lapses, surrenders and fully paid-ups ticking up slightly. Of course, you have to take into account that the environment in which we operate from a regulatory perspective makes it much easier to churn business, makes it much easier to lapse it in the sense that the costs of lapses are lower. We're not recuperating things as we used to in the past. It's relatively easier to do that. A big part of our lapse base, the Section 14 transfers, regulatory transfers, weren't there 4, 5 years ago and in spite of that, we still run at relatively low numbers in the middle market. So we're very happy with the [indiscernible] and the trend, we think, is fairly healthy. And in spite of all regulatory issues and all sorts of pressures, the core of what we do in our middle-market book, very healthy and doing extremely well. \r\nIf we look at the lower end of the market, Sanlam's Sky business, you can really see how we were able to manage it down to our target of around 10%. And then we can see the latter part of 2013 with some of the industrial action coming through and particularly in 2014, an uptick there. Now virtually all of that comes from the consumer being under pressure and particularly in the Rustenburg area. \r\nTo give you an indication, we sell about -- in this market segment, we sell about 10% of our policies in the platinum belt. And of course, if you can't really get going and sell -- for 3 months, people were striking there, they didn't have income, you would expect those numbers to be quite higher. We've put in special measures there to run that, but overall, I think, still a healthy result, given the composition -- where we're at in the country \r\nOne of our key measures and how we -- the shop window into a contractual savings business like ourself is really investment performance. We're very happy to say both on a 3-year basis and a 5-year basis, we -- more than 90% of our mandates, we've been performing at or better than the benchmark, which is really what we've been aiming for and very stellar performance there. Particularly, we have fixed benchmarks, not the variable benchmark, but fixed benchmarks that you would expect in a life company that you would like to, on an asset liability matching type of a mandate, we've been doing extremely well. So on our big Sanlam book in particular, we're fairly happy with the results over there. I think Herd Kreyvocken [ph] and the team on the investment side has done particularly well here. \r\nThen as become usual, we talk about our operational efficiencies and positive experience variances. Again, coming from a number of sources, particularly on the risk side, again, close to about ZAR 500 million for the half year as opposed to the other numbers for the full year. You can see, as a percentage of our book, it is in that range of between 3% and 4% that we've been guiding the market and so again, the book performing particularly well. And if you put all of this together, it has really resulted in a return that is substantially higher than what we would like it to be. \r\nSo if you really look at what has been doing, a big part of the strategy is on the diversification side. On the business component, on the left-hand side on the slide, you can see the Group Equity Value. About half of our business is life, then a much better distribution than what we've had in the past between general insurance, investment management, credit and banking, and admin health and then surplus money. If you look at the profit on the right, you can really see which are the most profitable businesses in terms of the component of the value. But much more diversified than what it used to be, and that is why we can also stomach a bit of the difficulties that we see in the economy. \r\nOn the diversification side, in terms of countries, you see still the South African base, around 75% of our activity and profits and investments come from there, with about 25% of our investments mainly into Anglophone Africa, India, Malaysia, the old colonies, the lower end of the market where we have a differential advantage, in many cases a first mover advantage as well, barriers to entry to the big players from overseas who come with very expensive systems, try to penetrate the high end of the market and from there, go to the lower end. Very difficult to do that. I think we have a clear differential advantage in most of these as a first mover. And then on the high end of the market also, mainly in the U.K., having a base where we offer optionality and where we have systems where we can invest in the U.S. and Australia and in several other places. So working fairly well across that international positioning. \r\nIf you look at the diversification a bit further, in 2003, sort of 10 years ago, about close to being 100% South African business with a little bit in Namibia. If you look to the right, about half of what we achieved now in terms of the value of new business on the life side, really coming from areas that we didn't play in. And even within the traditional South African market, quite a bit of new business and innovation taking place. So overall, you get the idea that it's much more diverse and so forth. \r\nAnd if you look at the profit, you can clearly see the growth. The circle becoming bigger as we move to the right. And also new components, not all of it coming from a particular business. And even within that, we have credit, we have life, we have savings, we have investments, we have short-term insurance, we have a whole range of businesses, administration and so forth, much more than what we used to have. So the growth comes with much more diversification and, I think, much more resilience. \r\nJust a picture to show you as we're moving forward, how we're diversifying the base between South Africa; our emerging markets businesses in Africa, India and Malaysia; and in the U.K. The investments there, the value and the profit. Overall, you can see that trend increasing. More of our business is showing -- is being in the high-growth areas. \r\nJust a few slides on capital efficiency. The final SAM specifications are expected towards the end of the year. We'll be running a sort of a high-level dual process with the new risk-based system and with the old capital system to really see how that will impact us for the rest of the year. The SAM QIS3 results indicate that we have sufficient capital in our life operations and with the level of the markets, in particular. Of course, if markets adjust, we always have to look at those kinds of things. But for the moment, I think we are well-capitalized. We have ZAR 1.8 billion of investments in growth opportunities that we finalized in the first half of the year. We'll talk about 1 or 2 of them just now. And at the end of the 6 months, we had ZAR 3.3 billion earmarked for investment in growth opportunities. We'll come to that particular number and here it is. \r\nSo we started the year with ZAR 4 billion, we did investments of around ZAR 1.7 billion, we've added surplus capital of around ZAR 1 billion that gets us to end off with about ZAR 3.3 billion. And you can see there in Southeast Asia and Malaysia, we did the MCIS transaction, the Zurich transaction where we bought their stake in MCIS, a life business in Malaysia, for ZAR 1.2 billion. \r\nIn Rwanda, we acquired a controlling stake in the biggest insurance and finan --  one of the biggest financial services businesses there. In Botswana, we've bought back some shares of ours. We're up to close to 59% holding now in BIHL. In the Rest of Africa, we spend around ZAR 80 million. From the co-investment strategy with Santam, we realized a net ZAR 43 million that they paid. We bought their stake in Namibia, they bought our stakes or 35% of our stake to get tied into India and some of the other businesses. So we're the net recipient of ZAR 43 million. In the developed markets of the U.K., we spent ZAR 25 million, mainly in FOUR Capital, buying an additional share from our partners over there. In South Africa, we spent about ZAR 90 million. \r\nSo overall, you get the picture. We're continuously pushing on the capital and we have a pipeline available for -- in fact, pipeline that's slightly bigger than the ZAR 3.3 billion that we have over the next year or so that we will work. \r\nWith those few comments, I would like Kobus to come and address you on the specifics of the financial review. Kobus, over to you.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Johan. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It's a pleasure to share with you some of the features of our results for the 6 months. \r\nJust to start with just a comment on our presentation or the assumptions underlying the presentations. There were no changes in accounting policies fortunately for the 6 months period. Just some minor changes in the allocation of some of the investment businesses -- or some of the businesses within our investment cluster, but those are fairly minor. And then, as Johan indicated, we have seen an increase in the rates at which we discount some of our future cash flows, that had a negative impact on some of our valuations, but also on the value of the new life business and it had a negative impact of around 4% on the growth in the VNB and also margin -- marginally on the actual average margin that we've achieved on value of new business. \r\nSalient features, you've seen most of this. 18% return on Group Equity Value, which is well in excess of our internal target of just more than 12% for the period and on an adjusted basis, 15.3%. Those are annualized numbers and then some on life because [ph] business within the group remains well capitalized at 4.4x instead [ph] of regulatory capital requirement. Good growth in our operating profits and I'll show you some more detail on that in a while, and then business flows up 8%, and ZAR 5.5 billion increase in the net new flows that we've achieved across the business. \r\nThe next few slides will deal with some of individual clusters -- business clusters in the group, starting with Sanlam Personal Finance. Overall, good new business flows into that cluster, but you will see that in Sanlam Sky, our business at the lower end of the market, we have seen a 6% drop in overall new business flows. It's a combination of 33% drop in group business, where we write scheme -- small schemes. Those are bulky businesses and we didn't have the same level of inflows last year. \r\nThe individual life business is up by 6%. That's also lower than our normal expectation would be. Big reason there is the impact that the strikes in Rustenburg in the platinum belt had on our business. If you exclude that, the growth is more than 10%, which is slightly better performance than individual life. That's both life business and investment business in the middle market, up 8%. \r\nYou see it [indiscernible] are very strong single premium business there, but on the recurring premium, we see the impact of the economy as well in our recurring business, in particular on the risk side, we didn't have good growth in recurring premium business. \r\nGlacier had another good 6 months in terms of new flows, both Investment business and the life insurance business, we're particularly seeing some very good flows on to the investment platform of Glacier. Then overall, some good net flows from the cluster, in particular, again, Glacier. As you can see that they've upped the net inflows by almost ZAR 2 billion on to the platform there. \r\nValue of new business in SPF down 3% on the actual rates that we've used. On a comparable basis, it's a plus 4%. Again, a combination of lower flows but also a change in mix to some extent. And Sanlam Sky, on a comparable base, the increase is marginally up from the ZAR 146 million that we've achieved last year. And then on individual life, also was slightly up on last year if you use the same discount rate for the 2 periods. \r\nAnd in Individual life in particular, it's an issue of changes in mix, where we wrote less current life, for example, and I'll come back to the profit contribution of our Personal Finance.  First of all [ph], we took a deliberate decision to scale down the growth in our Personal Finance book [ph] and obviously [ph] Group Life that we write in that was also down for the period, and that impacted on the Individual life value of new business. And also the average margin that you see at the bottom, we have a margin slightly lower than last year. \r\nThe profit contribution from Sanlam Personal Finance up 26%, a very good performance. In all areas where we have an exposure [ph] to the equity markets in terms of fees that we've earned, we've seen a good increase in fees earned. And both in Sanlam Sky and in the individual life with [ph] the middle market business, we had some good mortality experience, some good underwriting experience which impacted on the growth, positively impacted. Sanlam Sky also benefited from the lower sales of the new business strain. Of course, the growth in new business strain was lower than normal which contributed to the growth of 44% there and [ph] their profit contribution. Glacier, obviously, will impact in -- their impact to the market had a good run in terms of investment returns or fees earned on the underlying assets. And as I've mentioned, Personal Loans book: the book remained more or less at the ZAR 3.7 billion level that it was in December, just marginally up. And the result of that, we have seen [ph] a lower contribution from profit from that book. We're still comfortable with the level of the raise [ph] in that book, but we deliberately didn't grow the book during the period. \r\nThe Group Equity Value of Personal Finance, almost ZAR 37 billion and returning 8.7% for the 6 months. That's a 6 months number and that's well ahead of the target that we've set for Personal Finance. \r\nOur Emerging Markets business. The actual new business flows is actually down by 32%, but the one number that, once you take into account in 2013, we've actually sold the collective investment scheme business in Namibia, which had a big impact in the flows in Namibia, if you exclude that, the Namibia business is actually up 50% on a like-for-like business, 5-0. Similarly, the overall new business flows is also about 50%, which is a better reflection of the underlying performance of individual businesses in the cluster. So a good performance there across all the areas of that business. \r\nThe Malaysian business include the first-time contribution of P&Os. That number -- the growth there is slightly inflated on a comparable basis. But good overall flows, good net business flows from that business. And then the value of new business from our emerging market business is up 44%, a combination of very good performance in Botswana where we wrote some profitable annuity business during the period, which also impacted on the average margin. The rest of our African business also increased the contribution to value of new business by -- life business -- by about 24% and also making good contribution there. \r\nThe profit contribution for emerging markets up 60% for the period. We did acquire some businesses during 2013 that made the first full 6 months contribution for this year, so it does inflate the growth slightly. But if you exclude that, the growth is still around 40%, just around 40%, which is an exceptional performance. \r\nWe always have one-off items in any reporting period, but might be the one -- bigger one that I should point out is that we actually reversed the provision in Shriram General in India that we've guided against our third-party exposure there for about ZAR 70 million, which also had an impact on the growth that we report there for our Indian businesses. But even if you exclude that one single item, the growth is still close to 30% year-on-year, a very good performance from our Emerging Market businesses. And you can also see the Group Equity Value return of 12% for a 6-month period, an exceptionally good performance there. \r\nOur investment businesses, the net flows obviously much more important in that business, where we've seen an increase of almost ZAR 2 billion in the net flows in Sanlam Investments. In particular, our Investment Management business in South Africa did very well in terms of new flows and net flows. The Wealth Management business show a negative flow for the period, but that's really a result of the loss of ZAR 1.5 billion of share schemes that they've administered, very low-margin business. So the rest of the business actually perform very well in terms of new flow, or net flows, there as well. \r\nOur new life flows. Employee benefits in South Africa are slightly lower than last year as a result of lower single premium business. We had some good recurring business flows and that's actually reflected in the value of new business at the bottom, where the bulk of the growth there actually came from our South African business, EV business that increased the value of New Life business over the period. \r\nThe profit contribution from our investment business up 43% and obviously, that's the one area we had the benefit from the higher equity markets and the fees that we've earned on that's a very good performance, in particular from Investment Management, up 34%. There's some good performance fees that they've earned for the period, as well, as a result of the level of investment performance that Johan also showed you. The employee benefits had good underwriting results, 24% up. And in Capital Management, SCM, had a very good 6 months period ZAR 161 million. But when comparing numbers, you should just maybe remember that last year, we had to provide for exposure to First Strut. So on a comparable basis, the increase there is less than at about 20%, but still a very good, good performance from Sanlam capital markets. Group Equity Value of ZAR 19 billion, another good return of about 11% for the 6 months period from that cluster of businesses. \r\nSantam, perhaps the star performer in terms of the turnaround that you've seen in their underwriting results, particularly on the agricultural side, the crop business, moving from a 1.3% underwriting margin to more than 7% for the 6 months period. And our investment in Santam yielded a return of 7% for the 6 months, it's now worth about 13 -- just more than ZAR 13 billion. \r\nSo if I look at the total flows, business flows on a gross basis, 8% increase with good flows across the board. If you take into account the one-off item where [ph] we collective investments, business in emerging markets, that number should be 50%. And on a net flow basis, also some good flows across the board, in particular, our Investment business, both in South Africa, the Institutional business and also our Glacier platform business. \r\nThe overall value in covered business, up 9% on a gross basis. Net of minority, 7%. And if you do the calculation on the comparable discount rate, the increase is 11% on a net basis. And as you can see there are very good contributions from emerging markets and -- Botswana there in particular, and then also our employee benefits in South Africa that made a quite a good contribution, strong contribution for the period. \r\nOverall operating profit, 44% up from last year on a cents per share basis. Margin lower by 43%. All our businesses contributing very strongly and particularly Santam, as I've mentioned, the turnaround in their underwriting performance. As I've mentioned, we did acquire some businesses during the period, so if you exclude that, the contribution from those businesses, there's still a 40% increase year-on-year. And then if you take into account all these one-off anomalies that I've mentioned, one-off items in some of the businesses, if you normalize the Santam performance of last year to the average that they've achieved for the second half of the year, the underwriting margin then, perhaps, a comparable increase is closer to high 20s, maybe 28%, 29%, if you want to look at a more sustainable or comparable level of increase in periods. Still a very good performance for the period. \r\nIf you could -- the overall income statement, 44% operating profit increase, normalized headline earnings, 27%. The net investment return is down 2% and I suppose one would've expected that to be higher because of our [ph] equity markets. Again, just to remind you that last year, we had about ZAR 200 million of exceptional items on that line, where we have an investment in Bank Windhoek [indiscernible] listed, we revalued [ph] that investment and we had a provision against one specific item that we've reversed last year. In total, that was about ZAR 200 million. And if you exclude that, that investment return line, also more or less reflect the -- what happened to the underlying investment market. \r\nSo overall, normalized headline earnings of 27%. And on an IFRS basis, a very similar level of increase, 28%.\r\nOur Group Equity Value amounted to ZAR 88 billion -- or ZAR 87.5 billion at the end of June, or put it [ph] ZAR 0.04277 a share. \r\nPersonal Finance is still, by far, the biggest single cluster, but as you can see, there's an increasing contribution from emerging markets in particular. As you've seen from the diversification slide, about 23% of the Group Equity Value is now outside of South Africa and that is growing each reporting period. \r\nAll our businesses exceeded their return targets. On the right-hand side, you'll see the performance. Overall, the group operations return of 9.5% for 6 months. All businesses well in excess of the targets that we've set for those businesses, with a total return of 8.6% or 18% on an annualized basis. And once you've adjusted for the effect of the market and the interest rates, the return is 7.5%, 7.4% or 15% -- just more than 15% annualized. \r\nJust look at the contribution to the ZAR 7.3 billion or the 18% return at the bottom, starting -- looking it up from ZAR 7.3 billion. Our non-life businesses and our excess capital have a return of about ZAR 3.3 billion, or our non-life businesses yielded a return of about 10% for the 6 months. The EV earnings, or the contribution from our life business, is just close to ZAR 4 billion, a return of about 9% -- just more than 9% from our life businesses for 6 months. And if I can just point a few items contributing to that ZAR 4 billion or ZAR 3.9 billion to a net value of new business of ZAR 600 million, the positive experience variances of ZAR 477 million, with the biggest contribution that is, actually, positive mortality experience, and then the impact of the markets. On investment, variance of the in-force book, those are because of the high level of the market, the fees that we're going to earn in the future added about almost ZAR 500 million to the value, and then the return on net worth of ZAR 765 million, which is also higher than our normal -- normalized expectations because of the higher level of markets for the period. \r\nIf we net -- middle column then adjust for the impact of the markets and the interest rates. On the right-hand side, we show you the contribution on a normalized basis, which is, as I've said, about, 15% annualized. \r\nSo in summary, I think we are happy that we continue to deliver shareholder value. We continue to exceed our hurdle rates and in particular, this period, where all the businesses did well above what -- the hurdles that we set for them. We've seen again some profitable growth, in particular, strong growth from some of our emerging markets but also, this time around, from our South African markets, businesses, a value of new business of plus 11% on a comparable basis. And then, as I've mentioned, if you strip out all the one-offs and the -- certain individual anomalies in the results, still operating profit that's close to 30% for the period. \r\nWe see the positive impact of diversification in the contribution in our results from our growth markets. And on the Capital Management side, we continue to invest in growth markets, and that's also our strategy. If you look at the ZAR 3.3 billion that we still have available, the focus will be to find those growth opportunities, particularly in the growth markets. \r\nWe have this overriding hurdle to achieve our -- achieve a certain minimum, return our business  [indiscernible]. On a cumulative basis, we continue to outperform that mark by quite some margin since we've listed the company in 1998. \r\nThat's the end of the financial part and I'll hand to Johan for the remaining part.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Kobus. Ladies and gentlemen, let me, for the moment, stand still with a few of the priorities that we have for the year that is left. In our Personal Finance business, that's our individual business in South Africa, there will  be a big focus on sales growth and to maintain the margins in the country. So we have some plans to grow adviser force in all the market segments. We fell a bit behind. We're catching up fairly quickly, particularly in the light [ph] of the strikes and so forth it would have been, I think, shortsighted to grow unfettered. But we're picking up there. \r\nWe're really focusing on product innovation. We've launched a number of new recurring premium products. Our market share is substantially low. \r\nIf you look at the savings space, our market share is around 18%, 20%. If we look at the recurring premium products, though, our market share is closer to 10%. And I think there is substantial scope to pick up on that, so we come with a whole range of new products and that seems to gain traction in the market. \r\nAnd then in Sanlam Sky particularly, our brokers are struggling. We have a whole range of measures there. Very happy to report, I think in August, it seems that we're already sort of back on track and things are looking well. Focus will be to continue at those levels for the rest of the year. \r\nPersistency is an issue. We essentially, as a life insurance business, make more money from keeping existing good business on the books rather than writing new business. And therefore, as much as new business is important, it's also important to keep the existing business on the books. So we have a number of measures to get persistency up. Where we do write new business, we really focus on quality. And that focus there, particularly in tough times, is what we think creates some differentiation between us and some of our competitors and there will be a substantial increase on that focus. \r\nEfficiency. We're driving that hard. We have a history, and I think people ask me what is our core competency in Sanlam? I've said that in the past. A big part of that, particularly in our life book, is the management of costs. And in area -- in times when inflation puts pressure on that, it is critically important that we keep on driving the efficiency. We have quite a few plans there to manage our costs down, not only this year but over the next 2, 3 years, and we have to drive those things a bit forward. \r\nThe transformation and employer of choice issue. Increasingly, our client base is changing. We're trying to change the composition also of our staff to reflect those changes and we're making some progress there on the B scorecard. We're a level 2 provider. There is scope to increase, particularly in the employment equity space and we have some plans there. Yesterday at the board, we also discussed the plan. We will be making additional investments into the space. \r\nAnd then the issue in South Africa of regulatory change. I think we've been talking a lot over the past 4, 5 years about changes coming to the fore. I think the time has now come as we're starting to implement them. A big part of that is on the regulatory capital side, the SAM project, where we're now starting to go live on a parallel run. The  QIS3 results are coming out. We have a much better idea of where we are. And by year end we'll have, I think, quite a good feel for how we -- our capital stack up and what can be done and what the future holds with respect to that. We've seen pension fund reform being driven. We think a lot of those things are imminent. Treating customers fairly is coming. We've made substantial progress. I think we're fairly happy with the position that we're in at this moment in time, not only in absolute terms but also relative to our competitors. I think we will set there. And then 1 or 2 missing pieces and particularly the RDR, the retail distribution review, which will have some impact to the way we sell our products, the way we see independents and tied agents and advisors and how that will pan out going forward. The relationships around conflict of interest in that space. I think there will be much more clarity as we move forward. And then the long anticipated move. We've had the Red Book strategy from government coming in 2011, moving to a Twin Peaks sort of a regulatory system with prudential regulation going to the reserve bank, not only of banks but also of insurers and investment managers. And then with market conduct regulation going to the FSB, we expect that legislation shortly, with sort of implementation by April of next year. I don't want to say 1st of April, but maybe 1st of April, and we'll see what that holds. \r\nSo overall, the big market, a few changes. In our emerging markets space, we've seen tremendous growth. You would have seen what's been happening. We've been buying businesses. Businesses have been growing organically and so forth. \r\nOur focus remains on Africa and then lower end of the markets in India and Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia. We would like to continue our focus on top line growth, the efficiencies that we drive in the business, getting those businesses on board, and capital optimization in the current operations. Many of the businesses that we bought were relatively small, over-capitalized and as we make them bigger and grow them, we utilize that capital better, the integration, we optimize reinsurance arrangements and a whole range of things that we can do over the short term to drive up the returns. We would like to bed down the new acquisitions in Rwanda and Malaysia. \r\nAnd Shriram Capital, the holding company, lots of synergies still between the different components of the Shriram Life business, Shriram General, the truck financing, Shriram truck financing, transport financing business, and then also with the retail operation, the financing in retail. Lots of stuff that we can do between these businesses. Already, the cross-selling is increasing quite substantially, but there's much more work that we can do to drive those businesses forward. \r\nOn IT, we have quite a few changes. We have one set for Namibia. We've implemented Project Mara [ph]. It's not in Kenya. And it's bedding down these things and with support from South Africa, I think we're doing fairly well. \r\nA key part of what we're trying to do here is do some additional transactions and deepening the existing relationships of partnerships in Africa, India and Malaysia. In Africa in particular, I think we've spoken in the past that we don't have General Insurance operations in Kenya, a big market that we're playing in. We don't have one in Ghana. There are some opportunities with partners and others to do something in those spaces. And across the board in Africa, we have some missing building blocks that we need to put in place. In India in particular, I think it's imminent now the restriction of the 26% FDI limit, foreign direct investment limit in insurance. There's been several discussions. It's been referred. Our understanding is that there will be a joint sitting of the Lower and the Higher House later in the year to address this issue and to get it to a vote. It's being supported by the majority party there and they have the majority in parliament to get these things through. And our expectation is that it will happen.  So we've earmarked the ZAR 550 million to increase our stake from 26% in the Life Insurance and General Insurance businesses from 26% to 49%. And then in Malaysia, there's a whole lot of space and additional things around the takaful, integrating our businesses and so forth. \r\nWe'd like to remain the leading player in Africa. We have 1 or 2 additional things that we're working on. We continuously refine the organizational capacity to support growth. It is impossible to find the talent in each of the countries, so a lot of the support to the countries come from South Africa where we do have, I think, key businesses to pull some people out, not permanently but to address particular issues. So we're working on that. \r\nAnd then the whole focus on trying to get governance, ethics, values aligned with what we do here in Sanlam is a major drive. \r\nSo there's quite a bit of work to be done to move, essentially, from where we're an investment holding company in many of these businesses to really make them an integral part and parcel of what we're about in Sanlam. So that's the major focus of the emerging markets. \r\nIf we look at the investment space, key, of course, as an investment business, is investment performance. And because the performance has been fairly good, it's really about maintaining that consistent upper-quartile investment performance to really, at least, outperform the mandates over the vast bulk of those mandates. And I think we have a good track record there and we'd like to maintain that. \r\nWe'd like to grow our market share in the higher-margin areas, particularly on the retail funds flows. I think that is coming through working better with Sanlam, getting the Sanlam money, and we're getting the Sanlam relationships to work. Sort of a project that we have is Sanlam for Sanlam. But then also driving the institutional fund flows. I think that's an area where we're a bit light. Our market share is not where it should be, but some good plans, and we have to start implementing those and getting results. \r\nI think a very positive part of our business, you would have seen the nice growth in the value of new business coming from EB. This is the more recurring nature and type of business. But on the large mandates side, these ZAR 10 billion, ZAR 5 billion type things, where we've been missing some of them in the past. There is quite a nice pipeline and indications are that in the next 6 months, we'll be able to land 1 or 2 of those things. And if we can do that, it will have a substantial change because these things produce value of new business of -- in excess of ZAR 100 million for one particular client on a particular day. So that, we hope, by bringing 1 or 2 of those on board, we can affect the one area, I think, where we were a bit light on the results. The value of new business, we can set that straight. So we are really looking at the EB pipeline and I'm fairly positive that we can do something there. \r\nThen it's all about cost-effective solutions to clients from across the Sanlam Investment value chain. I think we're making progress there as well, using the South African base, where people want to go offshore, use those opportunities and getting it right. We're doing well there. \r\nActive and passive. You know that we bought all of the minorities in Satrix. It is really refocusing that business, getting more money into that, that seems to be working on the passive management capabilities, but without detracting on what we're doing on the active side. So overall, driving that. The African investments proposition is doing well. We have a few African funds, an African property fund, an African debt fund that's been launched recently. Those things are doing well. And then across the businesses to work better together, not to fight inside as much but to collaborate inside and to work on the outside. \r\nAt Santam, we've turned the corner there. We're doing pretty well, but we have to deliver on the diversified growth, the market diversification. We have a whole range of these things, partnering into Africa, India and so forth, the specialist business, Santam Re and so. \r\nContinued growth at MiWay, which is critical. You  only get it at that level with investment and advertisements and these kinds of things, but we're on track. I think it's a solid business now with relatively low claims ratios on the motor side. \r\nOur quality of the risk pool is critically important. I think we've done a great job of moving our risk profile down, moving away particularly from climate-type risk, flooding and areas like that, where we've either adjusted the rates or withdrawn from those things completely. But there's still a lot to do on the unprofitable accounts. People who target for things to be carried away and for theft seems to be recurring targets, so we have to really do a lot to rectify our unprofitable accounts. \r\nWe have to drive efficiencies through the value chain. Cost management key in this thing with dropping of the rand vis-a-vis the other currencies as we get motor parts in. We have to look at other solutions to really provide a better service at lower cost. And then the key strategic projects in the Commercial and Personal lines really driving it and the key of them being underwriting. I think we' will set.\r\nOverall ladies and gentlemen, I think the next 6 months will be tough. We won't get to a 44% increase, as Kobus has told you, in operational profit, but we will set, I think, to continue the trend going forward. \r\nIn terms of the outlook, we think we'll see increased pressure from the -- particularly on the retail side. Some market volatility probable, increasingly a bigger probability. We've seen a lot of money has been invested into equities. Market levels are high. But you have to ask yourself: Where else do you put the money? The returns on the other kinds of alternatives to equities are relatively low, even just relative to dividend yields, so you have to weigh these up. But it does -- if you're rational, there should be some increased market volatility, particularly in the equity space. \r\nWe have a few new acquisitions that we've done. We have to bed them down. We have a few in the pipeline, we have to finalize those, and I think 1 or 2 that can make a big difference. And then the issue around the compliance, the regulatory change in the areas that we've mentioned. They are important. To think that regulatory change will go away, I think, is a bit of a fallacy. In our business, you have to be able to deal with change. However, what I do think is we're trying too many things at the same time. It's impossible in a business to try and do 40, 50 things at the same time. We usually focus on 3, 4 major things and so forth. We're trying to work with the regulators and trying to get a bit more focused to look at the big things that can get 80% of the benefit rather than trying to do everything so that we'd quickly fall into sort of a tick-the-box sort of a strategy. \r\nSo overall, I think tough conditions, a few challenges, but we're on track, ladies and gentlemen. We are on track. We've been there for a while. No surprises, really. I think the market is a bit tougher. It shows in the results and the new business. But we're managing it well. It shows in the profit and the way we're coming through. We're much more diversified. We have some resilience. And overall, I think as a business and as a management, we're certainly happy. Been with the business now a long time. It's my 12th year. And a lot of what we've been trying is now coming through. There's still substantial upside looking into the next year or 2. \r\nAnd with that, we'd like to take a few questions. Can I ask Andre Zeeman, our Chief Actuary, and Kobus Möller to join me here in the softer chairs for some questions?",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nWelcome to our interim results presentation. As has become customary, we do it here in Johannesburg. More interest, more money here in Johannesburg. \r\nBefore we start with the presentation, I'd like to welcome a few people specifically. First, some board members. Chairman Desmond Smith; Philip Rademeyer; Paul Bradshaw, one of our directors from the U.K.; Kobus Möller, our Financial Director, who will talk about the financials just now; Yegs Ramiah; Ian Kirk; Themba Gamedze; Yaganthrie Ramiah; Andre Zeeman, who will do the actuarial questions later on, help us with that; some of our business people; and then a whole lot of our analysts and others who support us. Welcome. It's our pleasure to share with you another set of 6 months results. \r\nThe agenda is straightforward. We will start off with talking a little bit about the economy, the operating environment, what is happening and how it's impacting us. Talk about our strategy in Sanlam, how we're trying to run the business to take advantage out of the markets. Kobus Möller, the Financial Director, will come and give us the financial review, and I will end off with a few points on what we're going to concentrate on for the rest of year, what the outlook is and so forth. \r\nStarting off with the operating environment. I think the overriding thing that we see is the fundamentals, and particularly our major market, South Africa, are weak. So if we really look at things, it is challenging operating conditions, slow growth in global demand, weak economic growth in South Africa combined with industrial action over the past 6 months, and particularly the platinum mines that hurt us, and by and large and increasingly, we see the South African consumer being under pressure. \r\nIn the South African economy, we will have a few slides to show how we're doing and with respect to growth, interest rates, equity markets and currencies, and we'll also remark briefly on what is happening elsewhere in the economy. But if you really look at growth, you can see that growth is not going back to the levels that we've seen sort of 10 years ago, 8, 10 years ago, but we're sort of plodding along at around 2% and a bit -- a little bit below that. And that is not great. It isn't when you talk to -- particularly the investors from the U.S. and Europe, they're worried about it. And as we can see, there's a lot of pressure in our own economy. \r\nIf we look at interest rates, we can see the long-term rate, the 9-year bond rate that we use, by and large, to value our business. You can see that has gone up by about 70 basis points. And of course, because we use that as the discount rate, it had a negative effect on the value of new business to the tune of about 4%, so -- but we were under pressure with the volumes as well. The new business margin went down a little bit because of the higher discount rate. The short-term rate sort of very much the same, if we compared it to the 2 halves from 2013 to now. \r\nIf we look at the bond -- the equity market, it's done pretty well. And because we get the equities, the higher levels actually caused particular investment businesses to do substantially better. You can see the markets were about 11% higher and that has made a big impact for us on the bond market, the returns were 3.4%, which is also substantially better than the previous period. So overall, if we look at the market, a positive effect on our results. \r\nSimilarly with the exchange rate. The exchange rate has weakened quite a bit and that has had positive effects from the income that we've seen, particularly from Europe -- European operations and the U.K., we see that on a period -- of the 2 periods that we're comparing, exchange rate weakened by 26% so of course, the result from the U.K. would be higher. You see the U.S. rate there, Botswana also positively impacted. India and the Rest of Africa, particularly because of what's happening in Ghana, the effect is fairly neutral. But overall, you can see a 5% better result coming from exchange rate movements. New business volumes a 2% effect, on the value of new business a 1% positive effect. \r\nSo the economy. If we look at the economy in more detail, one of our bigger operations in Botswana, I think we're -- results were bolstered by a fairly resilient economy and a consumer base that is on the up. They've struggled for 1 year or 2 years, but I think the economy is well managed and they're doing well. If you look at the Rest of Africa, the GDB growth prospects exceed  South Africa despite slow global -- slow growth in global demand. The Ghana economy is struggling, particularly because of high inflation, devaluation of the currency and so forth. High growth rate, but once you look at the real rates, it is a bit under pressure. In India, we've had a below-trend economic growth, but I think a very buoyant equity market with Modi winning the elections there, being very pro-business, a lot of that has flowed through into the equity markets. And these markets have done extremely well, not only stopping at half year end, 30th of June, but running well into August and even now into September. And in Malaysia, I think the growth prospects remain in place. The economy is doing fairly well. The ringgit is holding up well as a currency. And particularly at that lower end of the market where we're playing, we see a quite substantial growth. So overall, things are fairly positive. \r\nSo from the economy, tough in South Africa, more positive signs elsewhere. Currency helping us, high markets helping us, higher interest rates, particularly in the long term impacting negatively on our results. Within this framework, if you look out a little bit about what our strategy is, nothing much has remained. We'd still focus on returns being the major driver and measurement of our success; return on group embedded value, as we measure it; big focus on the growth component, trying to maintain South Africa; get positive growth from pockets where there is still money to be made, but then trying to get into the higher growth areas offshore into Africa, India, Southeast Asia and also the developed markets in the U.K. in particular, trying to drive new business flows, diversification, operational efficiency. \r\nAgain, the second pillar of our strategy is around capital efficiency. We were able to do quite a bit around that. And going into SAM, I think we're well placed to sort of capitalize on 1 or 2 opportunities that has become available. \r\nSo if you look at the core strategy, about 75%, 80% of our business in South Africa. It's key that we get that to work. We look at lower growth but really focus on sustainability within the businesses. It's much more focused on efficiency and so forth, really getting the returns up, trying to do more with clients and so not trying to add a massive number of new businesses, but trying to do more with clients and so forth. And then through the mechanism of capital management, trying to build a future for us into the higher growth areas, particularly the African markets, the Anglophone African markets, the lower end of the market in India, Southeast Asia, Malaysia and others. \r\nAnd also at the high end of the market, trying to capitalize into the opportunities that we see for our clients into places like the U.K, diversifying portfolios and so forth. And by putting all of that together, you get sort of a blended growth. In South Africa, much more stable type of an environment, giving us 12, 13 sort of a percent. Offshore, higher growth, 30% and higher. Lower penetration, less competition. And by putting those 2 things together, you can get to around 16%, 17% in the shorter term. In the longer term, around 15%, which is what we're trying to achieve. So trying to get to around 10% sort of double-digit real growth into the future. \r\nIf you look at the actual results, I think some of the highlights there, the -- certainly, in my mind, the major highlight is the net operating profit per share that increased by 43%. Now that's off the back of most of the businesses working well. Kobus will talk about that a bit later. Santam coming back to the party, having had a difficult year in 2013. They've done pretty well this year. The higher asset base helping Sanlam Investments. Personal individual business, Sanlam Personal Finance, doing very well, and I think a particularly good performance from our Emerging Markets business. We did buy some new businesses, but even when you strip that out, 36% growth in the net operating profit x acquisitions, so a very, very solid base going forward. \r\nIf you look at business volumes, we can see some of the pressure coming through. New business volumes increased by 8% to ZAR 82 billion. That's excluding white label. Our net fund flows were ZAR 19 billion. It's up 40%. We are able to retain more money within the business. Net life value of new business, 7% up to ZAR 600-odd million. I'll talk to 1 or 2 areas where we struggled a little bit and Kobus will show you, coming from the strikes and so forth. Since normalization there, we're sort of back to normal. But the higher discount rate set -- knocked that number by about 4%. \r\nOur net value of new business margin around 2.68.  On most of the products, we've been able to maintain our margin, but our mix hurt us a little bit. And the Group Equity Value of ZAR 42.77 per share. Remember, we pay dividends once a year. The dividend got paid this year, so it's tough to grow the Group Equity Value during the first half. Most of the growth comes in the second half. \r\nAnd if we really look at the annualized return on group embedded value, actual number around 18% against a target that is substantially lower, just above 12%. But on an adjusted basis, if you normalize for the markets that's done particularly well, we're at that level of about 15% that we would like to be at. So plan -- everything is sort of going, by and large, according to plan. \r\nIf you really look at the operational efficiencies, the growth stays intact. We've been able to take Sanlam from a fairly stagnant business, not growing, to a business where the value of new business is now at least expected to be well over ZAR 1 billion on an annualized basis. For the half year, we've done pretty well. You can see how particularly the Emerging Markets have done well, and you can also see the majority coming through in the South African base and the strikes hindering us in the growth area, the lower end of the market in South Africa really putting some lid on the South African growth. But most of the businesses outside of the country growing fairly well. \r\nIf we look at persistency, we're very happy that the persistency is still well within the assumption base. But as the consumer is under pressure, and particularly in the platinum area and a few things, we see the lapses, surrenders and fully paid-ups ticking up slightly. Of course, you have to take into account that the environment in which we operate from a regulatory perspective makes it much easier to churn business, makes it much easier to lapse it in the sense that the costs of lapses are lower. We're not recuperating things as we used to in the past. It's relatively easier to do that. A big part of our lapse base, the Section 14 transfers, regulatory transfers, weren't there 4, 5 years ago and in spite of that, we still run at relatively low numbers in the middle market. So we're very happy with the [indiscernible] and the trend, we think, is fairly healthy. And in spite of all regulatory issues and all sorts of pressures, the core of what we do in our middle-market book, very healthy and doing extremely well. \r\nIf we look at the lower end of the market, Sanlam's Sky business, you can really see how we were able to manage it down to our target of around 10%. And then we can see the latter part of 2013 with some of the industrial action coming through and particularly in 2014, an uptick there. Now virtually all of that comes from the consumer being under pressure and particularly in the Rustenburg area. \r\nTo give you an indication, we sell about -- in this market segment, we sell about 10% of our policies in the platinum belt. And of course, if you can't really get going and sell -- for 3 months, people were striking there, they didn't have income, you would expect those numbers to be quite higher. We've put in special measures there to run that, but overall, I think, still a healthy result, given the composition -- where we're at in the country \r\nOne of our key measures and how we -- the shop window into a contractual savings business like ourself is really investment performance. We're very happy to say both on a 3-year basis and a 5-year basis, we -- more than 90% of our mandates, we've been performing at or better than the benchmark, which is really what we've been aiming for and very stellar performance there. Particularly, we have fixed benchmarks, not the variable benchmark, but fixed benchmarks that you would expect in a life company that you would like to, on an asset liability matching type of a mandate, we've been doing extremely well. So on our big Sanlam book in particular, we're fairly happy with the results over there. I think Herd Kreyvocken [ph] and the team on the investment side has done particularly well here. \r\nThen as become usual, we talk about our operational efficiencies and positive experience variances. Again, coming from a number of sources, particularly on the risk side, again, close to about ZAR 500 million for the half year as opposed to the other numbers for the full year. You can see, as a percentage of our book, it is in that range of between 3% and 4% that we've been guiding the market and so again, the book performing particularly well. And if you put all of this together, it has really resulted in a return that is substantially higher than what we would like it to be. \r\nSo if you really look at what has been doing, a big part of the strategy is on the diversification side. On the business component, on the left-hand side on the slide, you can see the Group Equity Value. About half of our business is life, then a much better distribution than what we've had in the past between general insurance, investment management, credit and banking, and admin health and then surplus money. If you look at the profit on the right, you can really see which are the most profitable businesses in terms of the component of the value. But much more diversified than what it used to be, and that is why we can also stomach a bit of the difficulties that we see in the economy. \r\nOn the diversification side, in terms of countries, you see still the South African base, around 75% of our activity and profits and investments come from there, with about 25% of our investments mainly into Anglophone Africa, India, Malaysia, the old colonies, the lower end of the market where we have a differential advantage, in many cases a first mover advantage as well, barriers to entry to the big players from overseas who come with very expensive systems, try to penetrate the high end of the market and from there, go to the lower end. Very difficult to do that. I think we have a clear differential advantage in most of these as a first mover. And then on the high end of the market also, mainly in the U.K., having a base where we offer optionality and where we have systems where we can invest in the U.S. and Australia and in several other places. So working fairly well across that international positioning. \r\nIf you look at the diversification a bit further, in 2003, sort of 10 years ago, about close to being 100% South African business with a little bit in Namibia. If you look to the right, about half of what we achieved now in terms of the value of new business on the life side, really coming from areas that we didn't play in. And even within the traditional South African market, quite a bit of new business and innovation taking place. So overall, you get the idea that it's much more diverse and so forth. \r\nAnd if you look at the profit, you can clearly see the growth. The circle becoming bigger as we move to the right. And also new components, not all of it coming from a particular business. And even within that, we have credit, we have life, we have savings, we have investments, we have short-term insurance, we have a whole range of businesses, administration and so forth, much more than what we used to have. So the growth comes with much more diversification and, I think, much more resilience. \r\nJust a picture to show you as we're moving forward, how we're diversifying the base between South Africa; our emerging markets businesses in Africa, India and Malaysia; and in the U.K. The investments there, the value and the profit. Overall, you can see that trend increasing. More of our business is showing -- is being in the high-growth areas. \r\nJust a few slides on capital efficiency. The final SAM specifications are expected towards the end of the year. We'll be running a sort of a high-level dual process with the new risk-based system and with the old capital system to really see how that will impact us for the rest of the year. The SAM QIS3 results indicate that we have sufficient capital in our life operations and with the level of the markets, in particular. Of course, if markets adjust, we always have to look at those kinds of things. But for the moment, I think we are well-capitalized. We have ZAR 1.8 billion of investments in growth opportunities that we finalized in the first half of the year. We'll talk about 1 or 2 of them just now. And at the end of the 6 months, we had ZAR 3.3 billion earmarked for investment in growth opportunities. We'll come to that particular number and here it is. \r\nSo we started the year with ZAR 4 billion, we did investments of around ZAR 1.7 billion, we've added surplus capital of around ZAR 1 billion that gets us to end off with about ZAR 3.3 billion. And you can see there in Southeast Asia and Malaysia, we did the MCIS transaction, the Zurich transaction where we bought their stake in MCIS, a life business in Malaysia, for ZAR 1.2 billion. \r\nIn Rwanda, we acquired a controlling stake in the biggest insurance and finan --  one of the biggest financial services businesses there. In Botswana, we've bought back some shares of ours. We're up to close to 59% holding now in BIHL. In the Rest of Africa, we spend around ZAR 80 million. From the co-investment strategy with Santam, we realized a net ZAR 43 million that they paid. We bought their stake in Namibia, they bought our stakes or 35% of our stake to get tied into India and some of the other businesses. So we're the net recipient of ZAR 43 million. In the developed markets of the U.K., we spent ZAR 25 million, mainly in FOUR Capital, buying an additional share from our partners over there. In South Africa, we spent about ZAR 90 million. \r\nSo overall, you get the picture. We're continuously pushing on the capital and we have a pipeline available for -- in fact, pipeline that's slightly bigger than the ZAR 3.3 billion that we have over the next year or so that we will work. \r\nWith those few comments, I would like Kobus to come and address you on the specifics of the financial review. Kobus, over to you.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nThank you, Johan. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It's a pleasure to share with you some of the features of our results for the 6 months. \r\nJust to start with just a comment on our presentation or the assumptions underlying the presentations. There were no changes in accounting policies fortunately for the 6 months period. Just some minor changes in the allocation of some of the investment businesses -- or some of the businesses within our investment cluster, but those are fairly minor. And then, as Johan indicated, we have seen an increase in the rates at which we discount some of our future cash flows, that had a negative impact on some of our valuations, but also on the value of the new life business and it had a negative impact of around 4% on the growth in the VNB and also margin -- marginally on the actual average margin that we've achieved on value of new business. \r\nSalient features, you've seen most of this. 18% return on Group Equity Value, which is well in excess of our internal target of just more than 12% for the period and on an adjusted basis, 15.3%. Those are annualized numbers and then some on life because [ph] business within the group remains well capitalized at 4.4x instead [ph] of regulatory capital requirement. Good growth in our operating profits and I'll show you some more detail on that in a while, and then business flows up 8%, and ZAR 5.5 billion increase in the net new flows that we've achieved across the business. \r\nThe next few slides will deal with some of individual clusters -- business clusters in the group, starting with Sanlam Personal Finance. Overall, good new business flows into that cluster, but you will see that in Sanlam Sky, our business at the lower end of the market, we have seen a 6% drop in overall new business flows. It's a combination of 33% drop in group business, where we write scheme -- small schemes. Those are bulky businesses and we didn't have the same level of inflows last year. \r\nThe individual life business is up by 6%. That's also lower than our normal expectation would be. Big reason there is the impact that the strikes in Rustenburg in the platinum belt had on our business. If you exclude that, the growth is more than 10%, which is slightly better performance than individual life. That's both life business and investment business in the middle market, up 8%. \r\nYou see it [indiscernible] are very strong single premium business there, but on the recurring premium, we see the impact of the economy as well in our recurring business, in particular on the risk side, we didn't have good growth in recurring premium business. \r\nGlacier had another good 6 months in terms of new flows, both Investment business and the life insurance business, we're particularly seeing some very good flows on to the investment platform of Glacier. Then overall, some good net flows from the cluster, in particular, again, Glacier. As you can see that they've upped the net inflows by almost ZAR 2 billion on to the platform there. \r\nValue of new business in SPF down 3% on the actual rates that we've used. On a comparable basis, it's a plus 4%. Again, a combination of lower flows but also a change in mix to some extent. And Sanlam Sky, on a comparable base, the increase is marginally up from the ZAR 146 million that we've achieved last year. And then on individual life, also was slightly up on last year if you use the same discount rate for the 2 periods. \r\nAnd in Individual life in particular, it's an issue of changes in mix, where we wrote less current life, for example, and I'll come back to the profit contribution of our Personal Finance.  First of all [ph], we took a deliberate decision to scale down the growth in our Personal Finance book [ph] and obviously [ph] Group Life that we write in that was also down for the period, and that impacted on the Individual life value of new business. And also the average margin that you see at the bottom, we have a margin slightly lower than last year. \r\nThe profit contribution from Sanlam Personal Finance up 26%, a very good performance. In all areas where we have an exposure [ph] to the equity markets in terms of fees that we've earned, we've seen a good increase in fees earned. And both in Sanlam Sky and in the individual life with [ph] the middle market business, we had some good mortality experience, some good underwriting experience which impacted on the growth, positively impacted. Sanlam Sky also benefited from the lower sales of the new business strain. Of course, the growth in new business strain was lower than normal which contributed to the growth of 44% there and [ph] their profit contribution. Glacier, obviously, will impact in -- their impact to the market had a good run in terms of investment returns or fees earned on the underlying assets. And as I've mentioned, Personal Loans book: the book remained more or less at the ZAR 3.7 billion level that it was in December, just marginally up. And the result of that, we have seen [ph] a lower contribution from profit from that book. We're still comfortable with the level of the raise [ph] in that book, but we deliberately didn't grow the book during the period. \r\nThe Group Equity Value of Personal Finance, almost ZAR 37 billion and returning 8.7% for the 6 months. That's a 6 months number and that's well ahead of the target that we've set for Personal Finance. \r\nOur Emerging Markets business. The actual new business flows is actually down by 32%, but the one number that, once you take into account in 2013, we've actually sold the collective investment scheme business in Namibia, which had a big impact in the flows in Namibia, if you exclude that, the Namibia business is actually up 50% on a like-for-like business, 5-0. Similarly, the overall new business flows is also about 50%, which is a better reflection of the underlying performance of individual businesses in the cluster. So a good performance there across all the areas of that business. \r\nThe Malaysian business include the first-time contribution of P&Os. That number -- the growth there is slightly inflated on a comparable basis. But good overall flows, good net business flows from that business. And then the value of new business from our emerging market business is up 44%, a combination of very good performance in Botswana where we wrote some profitable annuity business during the period, which also impacted on the average margin. The rest of our African business also increased the contribution to value of new business by -- life business -- by about 24% and also making good contribution there. \r\nThe profit contribution for emerging markets up 60% for the period. We did acquire some businesses during 2013 that made the first full 6 months contribution for this year, so it does inflate the growth slightly. But if you exclude that, the growth is still around 40%, just around 40%, which is an exceptional performance. \r\nWe always have one-off items in any reporting period, but might be the one -- bigger one that I should point out is that we actually reversed the provision in Shriram General in India that we've guided against our third-party exposure there for about ZAR 70 million, which also had an impact on the growth that we report there for our Indian businesses. But even if you exclude that one single item, the growth is still close to 30% year-on-year, a very good performance from our Emerging Market businesses. And you can also see the Group Equity Value return of 12% for a 6-month period, an exceptionally good performance there. \r\nOur investment businesses, the net flows obviously much more important in that business, where we've seen an increase of almost ZAR 2 billion in the net flows in Sanlam Investments. In particular, our Investment Management business in South Africa did very well in terms of new flows and net flows. The Wealth Management business show a negative flow for the period, but that's really a result of the loss of ZAR 1.5 billion of share schemes that they've administered, very low-margin business. So the rest of the business actually perform very well in terms of new flow, or net flows, there as well. \r\nOur new life flows. Employee benefits in South Africa are slightly lower than last year as a result of lower single premium business. We had some good recurring business flows and that's actually reflected in the value of new business at the bottom, where the bulk of the growth there actually came from our South African business, EV business that increased the value of New Life business over the period. \r\nThe profit contribution from our investment business up 43% and obviously, that's the one area we had the benefit from the higher equity markets and the fees that we've earned on that's a very good performance, in particular from Investment Management, up 34%. There's some good performance fees that they've earned for the period, as well, as a result of the level of investment performance that Johan also showed you. The employee benefits had good underwriting results, 24% up. And in Capital Management, SCM, had a very good 6 months period ZAR 161 million. But when comparing numbers, you should just maybe remember that last year, we had to provide for exposure to First Strut. So on a comparable basis, the increase there is less than at about 20%, but still a very good, good performance from Sanlam capital markets. Group Equity Value of ZAR 19 billion, another good return of about 11% for the 6 months period from that cluster of businesses. \r\nSantam, perhaps the star performer in terms of the turnaround that you've seen in their underwriting results, particularly on the agricultural side, the crop business, moving from a 1.3% underwriting margin to more than 7% for the 6 months period. And our investment in Santam yielded a return of 7% for the 6 months, it's now worth about 13 -- just more than ZAR 13 billion. \r\nSo if I look at the total flows, business flows on a gross basis, 8% increase with good flows across the board. If you take into account the one-off item where [ph] we collective investments, business in emerging markets, that number should be 50%. And on a net flow basis, also some good flows across the board, in particular, our Investment business, both in South Africa, the Institutional business and also our Glacier platform business. \r\nThe overall value in covered business, up 9% on a gross basis. Net of minority, 7%. And if you do the calculation on the comparable discount rate, the increase is 11% on a net basis. And as you can see there are very good contributions from emerging markets and -- Botswana there in particular, and then also our employee benefits in South Africa that made a quite a good contribution, strong contribution for the period. \r\nOverall operating profit, 44% up from last year on a cents per share basis. Margin lower by 43%. All our businesses contributing very strongly and particularly Santam, as I've mentioned, the turnaround in their underwriting performance. As I've mentioned, we did acquire some businesses during the period, so if you exclude that, the contribution from those businesses, there's still a 40% increase year-on-year. And then if you take into account all these one-off anomalies that I've mentioned, one-off items in some of the businesses, if you normalize the Santam performance of last year to the average that they've achieved for the second half of the year, the underwriting margin then, perhaps, a comparable increase is closer to high 20s, maybe 28%, 29%, if you want to look at a more sustainable or comparable level of increase in periods. Still a very good performance for the period. \r\nIf you could -- the overall income statement, 44% operating profit increase, normalized headline earnings, 27%. The net investment return is down 2% and I suppose one would've expected that to be higher because of our [ph] equity markets. Again, just to remind you that last year, we had about ZAR 200 million of exceptional items on that line, where we have an investment in Bank Windhoek [indiscernible] listed, we revalued [ph] that investment and we had a provision against one specific item that we've reversed last year. In total, that was about ZAR 200 million. And if you exclude that, that investment return line, also more or less reflect the -- what happened to the underlying investment market. \r\nSo overall, normalized headline earnings of 27%. And on an IFRS basis, a very similar level of increase, 28%.\r\nOur Group Equity Value amounted to ZAR 88 billion -- or ZAR 87.5 billion at the end of June, or put it [ph] ZAR 0.04277 a share. \r\nPersonal Finance is still, by far, the biggest single cluster, but as you can see, there's an increasing contribution from emerging markets in particular. As you've seen from the diversification slide, about 23% of the Group Equity Value is now outside of South Africa and that is growing each reporting period. \r\nAll our businesses exceeded their return targets. On the right-hand side, you'll see the performance. Overall, the group operations return of 9.5% for 6 months. All businesses well in excess of the targets that we've set for those businesses, with a total return of 8.6% or 18% on an annualized basis. And once you've adjusted for the effect of the market and the interest rates, the return is 7.5%, 7.4% or 15% -- just more than 15% annualized. \r\nJust look at the contribution to the ZAR 7.3 billion or the 18% return at the bottom, starting -- looking it up from ZAR 7.3 billion. Our non-life businesses and our excess capital have a return of about ZAR 3.3 billion, or our non-life businesses yielded a return of about 10% for the 6 months. The EV earnings, or the contribution from our life business, is just close to ZAR 4 billion, a return of about 9% -- just more than 9% from our life businesses for 6 months. And if I can just point a few items contributing to that ZAR 4 billion or ZAR 3.9 billion to a net value of new business of ZAR 600 million, the positive experience variances of ZAR 477 million, with the biggest contribution that is, actually, positive mortality experience, and then the impact of the markets. On investment, variance of the in-force book, those are because of the high level of the market, the fees that we're going to earn in the future added about almost ZAR 500 million to the value, and then the return on net worth of ZAR 765 million, which is also higher than our normal -- normalized expectations because of the higher level of markets for the period. \r\nIf we net -- middle column then adjust for the impact of the markets and the interest rates. On the right-hand side, we show you the contribution on a normalized basis, which is, as I've said, about, 15% annualized. \r\nSo in summary, I think we are happy that we continue to deliver shareholder value. We continue to exceed our hurdle rates and in particular, this period, where all the businesses did well above what -- the hurdles that we set for them. We've seen again some profitable growth, in particular, strong growth from some of our emerging markets but also, this time around, from our South African markets, businesses, a value of new business of plus 11% on a comparable basis. And then, as I've mentioned, if you strip out all the one-offs and the -- certain individual anomalies in the results, still operating profit that's close to 30% for the period. \r\nWe see the positive impact of diversification in the contribution in our results from our growth markets. And on the Capital Management side, we continue to invest in growth markets, and that's also our strategy. If you look at the ZAR 3.3 billion that we still have available, the focus will be to find those growth opportunities, particularly in the growth markets. \r\nWe have this overriding hurdle to achieve our -- achieve a certain minimum, return our business  [indiscernible]. On a cumulative basis, we continue to outperform that mark by quite some margin since we've listed the company in 1998. \r\nThat's the end of the financial part and I'll hand to Johan for the remaining part.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nThank you, Kobus. Ladies and gentlemen, let me, for the moment, stand still with a few of the priorities that we have for the year that is left. In our Personal Finance business, that's our individual business in South Africa, there will  be a big focus on sales growth and to maintain the margins in the country. So we have some plans to grow adviser force in all the market segments. We fell a bit behind. We're catching up fairly quickly, particularly in the light [ph] of the strikes and so forth it would have been, I think, shortsighted to grow unfettered. But we're picking up there. \r\nWe're really focusing on product innovation. We've launched a number of new recurring premium products. Our market share is substantially low. \r\nIf you look at the savings space, our market share is around 18%, 20%. If we look at the recurring premium products, though, our market share is closer to 10%. And I think there is substantial scope to pick up on that, so we come with a whole range of new products and that seems to gain traction in the market. \r\nAnd then in Sanlam Sky particularly, our brokers are struggling. We have a whole range of measures there. Very happy to report, I think in August, it seems that we're already sort of back on track and things are looking well. Focus will be to continue at those levels for the rest of the year. \r\nPersistency is an issue. We essentially, as a life insurance business, make more money from keeping existing good business on the books rather than writing new business. And therefore, as much as new business is important, it's also important to keep the existing business on the books. So we have a number of measures to get persistency up. Where we do write new business, we really focus on quality. And that focus there, particularly in tough times, is what we think creates some differentiation between us and some of our competitors and there will be a substantial increase on that focus. \r\nEfficiency. We're driving that hard. We have a history, and I think people ask me what is our core competency in Sanlam? I've said that in the past. A big part of that, particularly in our life book, is the management of costs. And in area -- in times when inflation puts pressure on that, it is critically important that we keep on driving the efficiency. We have quite a few plans there to manage our costs down, not only this year but over the next 2, 3 years, and we have to drive those things a bit forward. \r\nThe transformation and employer of choice issue. Increasingly, our client base is changing. We're trying to change the composition also of our staff to reflect those changes and we're making some progress there on the B scorecard. We're a level 2 provider. There is scope to increase, particularly in the employment equity space and we have some plans there. Yesterday at the board, we also discussed the plan. We will be making additional investments into the space. \r\nAnd then the issue in South Africa of regulatory change. I think we've been talking a lot over the past 4, 5 years about changes coming to the fore. I think the time has now come as we're starting to implement them. A big part of that is on the regulatory capital side, the SAM project, where we're now starting to go live on a parallel run. The  QIS3 results are coming out. We have a much better idea of where we are. And by year end we'll have, I think, quite a good feel for how we -- our capital stack up and what can be done and what the future holds with respect to that. We've seen pension fund reform being driven. We think a lot of those things are imminent. Treating customers fairly is coming. We've made substantial progress. I think we're fairly happy with the position that we're in at this moment in time, not only in absolute terms but also relative to our competitors. I think we will set there. And then 1 or 2 missing pieces and particularly the RDR, the retail distribution review, which will have some impact to the way we sell our products, the way we see independents and tied agents and advisors and how that will pan out going forward. The relationships around conflict of interest in that space. I think there will be much more clarity as we move forward. And then the long anticipated move. We've had the Red Book strategy from government coming in 2011, moving to a Twin Peaks sort of a regulatory system with prudential regulation going to the reserve bank, not only of banks but also of insurers and investment managers. And then with market conduct regulation going to the FSB, we expect that legislation shortly, with sort of implementation by April of next year. I don't want to say 1st of April, but maybe 1st of April, and we'll see what that holds. \r\nSo overall, the big market, a few changes. In our emerging markets space, we've seen tremendous growth. You would have seen what's been happening. We've been buying businesses. Businesses have been growing organically and so forth. \r\nOur focus remains on Africa and then lower end of the markets in India and Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia. We would like to continue our focus on top line growth, the efficiencies that we drive in the business, getting those businesses on board, and capital optimization in the current operations. Many of the businesses that we bought were relatively small, over-capitalized and as we make them bigger and grow them, we utilize that capital better, the integration, we optimize reinsurance arrangements and a whole range of things that we can do over the short term to drive up the returns. We would like to bed down the new acquisitions in Rwanda and Malaysia. \r\nAnd Shriram Capital, the holding company, lots of synergies still between the different components of the Shriram Life business, Shriram General, the truck financing, Shriram truck financing, transport financing business, and then also with the retail operation, the financing in retail. Lots of stuff that we can do between these businesses. Already, the cross-selling is increasing quite substantially, but there's much more work that we can do to drive those businesses forward. \r\nOn IT, we have quite a few changes. We have one set for Namibia. We've implemented Project Mara [ph]. It's not in Kenya. And it's bedding down these things and with support from South Africa, I think we're doing fairly well. \r\nA key part of what we're trying to do here is do some additional transactions and deepening the existing relationships of partnerships in Africa, India and Malaysia. In Africa in particular, I think we've spoken in the past that we don't have General Insurance operations in Kenya, a big market that we're playing in. We don't have one in Ghana. There are some opportunities with partners and others to do something in those spaces. And across the board in Africa, we have some missing building blocks that we need to put in place. In India in particular, I think it's imminent now the restriction of the 26% FDI limit, foreign direct investment limit in insurance. There's been several discussions. It's been referred. Our understanding is that there will be a joint sitting of the Lower and the Higher House later in the year to address this issue and to get it to a vote. It's being supported by the majority party there and they have the majority in parliament to get these things through. And our expectation is that it will happen.  So we've earmarked the ZAR 550 million to increase our stake from 26% in the Life Insurance and General Insurance businesses from 26% to 49%. And then in Malaysia, there's a whole lot of space and additional things around the takaful, integrating our businesses and so forth. \r\nWe'd like to remain the leading player in Africa. We have 1 or 2 additional things that we're working on. We continuously refine the organizational capacity to support growth. It is impossible to find the talent in each of the countries, so a lot of the support to the countries come from South Africa where we do have, I think, key businesses to pull some people out, not permanently but to address particular issues. So we're working on that. \r\nAnd then the whole focus on trying to get governance, ethics, values aligned with what we do here in Sanlam is a major drive. \r\nSo there's quite a bit of work to be done to move, essentially, from where we're an investment holding company in many of these businesses to really make them an integral part and parcel of what we're about in Sanlam. So that's the major focus of the emerging markets. \r\nIf we look at the investment space, key, of course, as an investment business, is investment performance. And because the performance has been fairly good, it's really about maintaining that consistent upper-quartile investment performance to really, at least, outperform the mandates over the vast bulk of those mandates. And I think we have a good track record there and we'd like to maintain that. \r\nWe'd like to grow our market share in the higher-margin areas, particularly on the retail funds flows. I think that is coming through working better with Sanlam, getting the Sanlam money, and we're getting the Sanlam relationships to work. Sort of a project that we have is Sanlam for Sanlam. But then also driving the institutional fund flows. I think that's an area where we're a bit light. Our market share is not where it should be, but some good plans, and we have to start implementing those and getting results. \r\nI think a very positive part of our business, you would have seen the nice growth in the value of new business coming from EB. This is the more recurring nature and type of business. But on the large mandates side, these ZAR 10 billion, ZAR 5 billion type things, where we've been missing some of them in the past. There is quite a nice pipeline and indications are that in the next 6 months, we'll be able to land 1 or 2 of those things. And if we can do that, it will have a substantial change because these things produce value of new business of -- in excess of ZAR 100 million for one particular client on a particular day. So that, we hope, by bringing 1 or 2 of those on board, we can affect the one area, I think, where we were a bit light on the results. The value of new business, we can set that straight. So we are really looking at the EB pipeline and I'm fairly positive that we can do something there. \r\nThen it's all about cost-effective solutions to clients from across the Sanlam Investment value chain. I think we're making progress there as well, using the South African base, where people want to go offshore, use those opportunities and getting it right. We're doing well there. \r\nActive and passive. You know that we bought all of the minorities in Satrix. It is really refocusing that business, getting more money into that, that seems to be working on the passive management capabilities, but without detracting on what we're doing on the active side. So overall, driving that. The African investments proposition is doing well. We have a few African funds, an African property fund, an African debt fund that's been launched recently. Those things are doing well. And then across the businesses to work better together, not to fight inside as much but to collaborate inside and to work on the outside. \r\nAt Santam, we've turned the corner there. We're doing pretty well, but we have to deliver on the diversified growth, the market diversification. We have a whole range of these things, partnering into Africa, India and so forth, the specialist business, Santam Re and so. \r\nContinued growth at MiWay, which is critical. You  only get it at that level with investment and advertisements and these kinds of things, but we're on track. I think it's a solid business now with relatively low claims ratios on the motor side. \r\nOur quality of the risk pool is critically important. I think we've done a great job of moving our risk profile down, moving away particularly from climate-type risk, flooding and areas like that, where we've either adjusted the rates or withdrawn from those things completely. But there's still a lot to do on the unprofitable accounts. People who target for things to be carried away and for theft seems to be recurring targets, so we have to really do a lot to rectify our unprofitable accounts. \r\nWe have to drive efficiencies through the value chain. Cost management key in this thing with dropping of the rand vis-a-vis the other currencies as we get motor parts in. We have to look at other solutions to really provide a better service at lower cost. And then the key strategic projects in the Commercial and Personal lines really driving it and the key of them being underwriting. I think we' will set.\r\nOverall ladies and gentlemen, I think the next 6 months will be tough. We won't get to a 44% increase, as Kobus has told you, in operational profit, but we will set, I think, to continue the trend going forward. \r\nIn terms of the outlook, we think we'll see increased pressure from the -- particularly on the retail side. Some market volatility probable, increasingly a bigger probability. We've seen a lot of money has been invested into equities. Market levels are high. But you have to ask yourself: Where else do you put the money? The returns on the other kinds of alternatives to equities are relatively low, even just relative to dividend yields, so you have to weigh these up. But it does -- if you're rational, there should be some increased market volatility, particularly in the equity space. \r\nWe have a few new acquisitions that we've done. We have to bed them down. We have a few in the pipeline, we have to finalize those, and I think 1 or 2 that can make a big difference. And then the issue around the compliance, the regulatory change in the areas that we've mentioned. They are important. To think that regulatory change will go away, I think, is a bit of a fallacy. In our business, you have to be able to deal with change. However, what I do think is we're trying too many things at the same time. It's impossible in a business to try and do 40, 50 things at the same time. We usually focus on 3, 4 major things and so forth. We're trying to work with the regulators and trying to get a bit more focused to look at the big things that can get 80% of the benefit rather than trying to do everything so that we'd quickly fall into sort of a tick-the-box sort of a strategy. \r\nSo overall, I think tough conditions, a few challenges, but we're on track, ladies and gentlemen. We are on track. We've been there for a while. No surprises, really. I think the market is a bit tougher. It shows in the results and the new business. But we're managing it well. It shows in the profit and the way we're coming through. We're much more diversified. We have some resilience. And overall, I think as a business and as a management, we're certainly happy. Been with the business now a long time. It's my 12th year. And a lot of what we've been trying is now coming through. There's still substantial upside looking into the next year or 2. \r\nAnd with that, we'd like to take a few questions. Can I ask Andre Zeeman, our Chief Actuary, and Kobus Möller to join me here in the softer chairs for some questions?",
      "transcript_text3": "Yesterday -- I won't mention names -- I heard a lot about behavior change and how there's an attempt to create more business, lower costs, have more commitment and loyalty from customers. You mentioned, for example, Santam's motor. You didn't mention anything about behavior change. Is that something that you do consider or do you think it really is not that significant?\n\n---\n\nWell, of course, we have to talk about behavioral change and incentives to change behavior.  Like for instance, if people don't claim, if they manage things better, that there is enough differentiation in the system that they get the benefit through either lower premiums or a range of other benefits, and not only in General Insurance will we get that, and short-term insurance, but across the board. A lot of the products that we've launched in the recurring market space, for people who stay with us for longer periods and so forth, we have an RA, the Echo RA and so forth, actually rewards people for staying with us for longer periods. So that trying -- and all these things increasingly have components in place to try to align the behavior of the client base with where they -- with our profitability but also where it makes sense. So increasingly, embedded in many of what -- embedded in a lot of what we do is that behavioral change, not only amongst the clients but also in ourselves. I think in the last 2 years, just to give you an idea, a big part of our business has been focusing on treating customers fairly. We adopted that approach. We called it client-centricity in 2003. We had the statement of intent that made most of our products much more flexible. You know we recouped substantial costs if people moved away from our products. Some people call it penalties. It's not penalties. It's just a recoupment of the costs that we've already spent upfront based on the contract that we had with people. But those things are much more flexible and we're moving to a much bigger consumerism. We spend much more time on things like Hellopeter and really, the ombudsman for long-term insurance and general insurance and trying to address things and so forth. And if you really look at what we're doing in the business at Sanlam, but also in the industry, we're not the only people, there's been a massive focus over the past 2 or 3 years to do things better, to work towards sustainability and so forth. And I do know there are 1 or 2 places where we can still do a lot and so forth. But they're on the agenda, and the whole issue is about behavioral change in the business itself, amongst our client base and aligning and getting better value for money over the longer term into clients. So that is really a big focus. It doesn't bring anything now, but these are sound business principles. Serve your client better, they don't leave you and they stay. And if you really look on how we also remunerate not only ourselves and [indiscernible] but our distribution and so forth, a big part of that is on how -- what the persistency is. It's not about the sales per se. I go and visit most of our offices in a -- during a year. And true, what we'd sell the new business is important, but it's as important to have persistency. None of our people, our salespeople, can win an award for sales without meeting very stringent levels on persistency. It's as important because that shows they're doing the right thing, they're selling things to people who can stay on the box and so forth. And clearly, one can always do more, but I think on a relative basis, I think we will set. Kobus, anything you guys would like to -- can you just announce your name and where you're from when you ask a question, please? May I request that? So that we know where to look.\n\n---\n\nNorman Britts [ph]. It's a private family trust.\n\n---\n\nGood. Any other question? Sir?\n\n---\n\nFrom [indiscernible] My name is Rosenberg [ph]. Firstly, I'd like to congratulate you and your team on producing first-rate results. The standout item, as far as I'm concerned, is one that doesn't feature the percentage increase, and that is the group operating margin, which has gone from 20.5% to 27.5%. It's an increase in excess of 34%. Well done on that particular item. Regarding my question, I refer to the Emerging Markets table on Page 32. Now I'm comparing the differential between net fund flows and new business for the various territories. And there's some massive differences in percentages and possibly, you could give me an explanation as to the reason why. The rest of Africa is just under 2%. India, Malaysia and Namibia are in excess of 75%. Botswana is approximately 60%. Now I fully understand that net fund flows are after commissions, claims, cancellations and lapses, but why are these percentages so widely different from the various territories?\n\n---\n\nI think a lot of that lies into the economic conditions of those territories, the products that we have available, the businesses that we got on board. In many of those places, we did invest and we acquired additional businesses. And then, of course, the product mix on the life side. In Namibia in particular, you see a massive negative there and Kobus has spoken to that. This is where we sold -- didn't really sell, we exchanged the big part of our business that we owned 100% for shares in Bank Windhoek or in, actually, Capricorn Holdings, the holding company of Bank Windhoek. So our share of the holding in Bank Windhoek went up from 19%, I think, in that process to 25%, Kobus? 25%?\n\n---\n\nYes, 25%.\n\n---\n\nSo that is all in there and that is why you have these massive things. It is always difficult, when you look at business flows, to form a clear picture. And increasingly, we've had this discussion because of exactly that issue that you have, it's massive changes in certain -- between certain countries and so forth. In Namibia, you will see the numbers are fairly big. Last year, we had ZAR 4 billion flows in there. But most of those were money-market type funds, where people didn't pay tax and the margin was virtually 0. And you compare that with the rest of Africa, for instance, where the margins are well over 10%. And that differentiation makes no sense if you lump these numbers together. So in future, you'll see we've dropped all sort of white labels from our results because the margins are relatively small. In future, we will increasingly distinguish when we do on the business flows between high-margin and low-margin stuff that we simply house in different places. Kobus, something that...\n\n---\n\nI think you're correct. I think the answer lies in the mix of business. I mean, this -- if you -- in short-term insurance business for example, that will be net of benefit payments, where there's actually very small margin left, usually just the underwriting margin, while in business flows, your net flows will be a much larger number. So it's really the -- what we disclose in that table is the combined flows of all those businesses, so it's really difficult to look at the overall number to explain trends.\n\n---\n\nSorry, could I persist in this question, please, with specific reference to India and Malaysia, where you've just started in recent years. What accounts for that massive differential?\n\n---\n\nWhat we've included for the first time, I mean, remember, we acquired the business in Pacific & Orient, the short-term insurance business in Malaysia. And in the 2014 numbers, they are included for the first time, so that will explain the jump there.\n\n---\n\nSimply buying the business. I mean, in the one period, we didn't have it. The second period, it's in. But thank you, Mr. Rosenberg [ph], for pointing that out. I mean, it's worrying us as well. We'd much rather focus on the value of the business rather than simply the flows itself. Anything else? There, right behind you.\n\n---\n\nIan Cruickshanks, SA Institute of Race Relations. You mentioned the pressure on the savings space. Now isn't this -- this is probably likely to intensify with unemployment, cost of living -- cost of every darn thing actually, that really, it's going to mean that there will be less opportunity to grow your market share. And would you just care to give an indication of what this impact this will have on new business and also profitability therefrom?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think if you look at South Africa, it is a fairly congested space. For a long time, our financial services are well developed. To think that there is no competition, although we may have only 5 major banks or 5 insurers or 6 of them and so forth, the competition is fairly fierce and often destructive for what is available for share of wallet and so. So you have to, when you do something, focus on the particular niche areas where you think you can -- you have sort of an edge. This is what we've been trying to do. But increasingly, in South Africa, it is not about adding much more, and we've said that, but try to maintain what we have. And a big part of the benefit comes from efficiency gains in how we manage. So it's being more efficient in doing things, not necessarily grow market share and these kinds of things, but make more money out of what we already have and the maintenance thereof, and then from redeploying that profits into the higher-growth areas where we have less competition, of Africa, India, Malaysia and some niche areas in the U.K., where we will set to capitalize. So what we see in Sanlam is actually the change over time from being fairly big in South Africa to maintaining and deploying businesses and so forth. And you see that in the results as well, South Africa doing well but coming with a result of roughly about 15% -- 14%, 15% higher. But most of it actually comes from the new areas. That's where we get the growth of 60% and so. We're buying more businesses there. But organically, the number is about more than 40% growth in these high-growth areas. And that takes up the slack that we get from the consumer being under pressure in South Africa. And if you really look at that and you take that whole planning forward, we think we can more than compensate from what we lose here and the tighter competition through what we gain in the new markets so that, on a net basis, we can be positive and grow the business at a rate -- sort of at the real rate of sort of close to double digits, nominal rate of around 15%, what we're aiming for. If you deduct inflation, 5%, 6%, it gets us around close to 10%. This is what we've been able to do now for about 10, 12 years and we think there is much more of that. Anything else? If there are no questions here, can I ask any questions from the phone lines?\n\n---\n\nIt's Karen Smith here from [indiscernible] in Cape [indiscernible] and since I can't rely on my sense of sight, I just want to be sure that I'll be quoting the right people. Was it Dr. Johan van Zyl speaking at the beginning, and then it was Kobus Möller, and then back to Dr. van Zyl, right?\n\n---\n\nThat's correct. Kobus Möller, not -- M-O.\n\n---\n\nMöller, Möller.\n\n---\n\nNot M-U. Good. Any other questions from the lines, from the webcast?\n\n---\n\nI think we've actually answered that question earlier, but just to -- the question is the 32% fall that we show in emerging market business flows, new business flows. And actually, as Johan explained. We've actually sold -- the transaction with Bank Windhoek in May last year, 2013, so for the first part of the year, we still included the business flows from the collective investment scheme in our results. It's obviously not there for this period. And if you exclude that, the 32% fall is actually, on a comparable basis, a 50% increase. And I think that's actually the number to focus on if you look at the underlying performance. It's just a technical issue.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Final questions from here? Mr. Zeeman, thank you. Thank you for the support. Thank you for being here and we hope that we can come with another positive set of results in 6 months' time. Thank you.\r\n.",
      "transcript_text4": "【回答: Unknown Shareholder (Shareholders)】\nYesterday -- I won't mention names -- I heard a lot about behavior change and how there's an attempt to create more business, lower costs, have more commitment and loyalty from customers. You mentioned, for example, Santam's motor. You didn't mention anything about behavior change. Is that something that you do consider or do you think it really is not that significant?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nWell, of course, we have to talk about behavioral change and incentives to change behavior.  Like for instance, if people don't claim, if they manage things better, that there is enough differentiation in the system that they get the benefit through either lower premiums or a range of other benefits, and not only in General Insurance will we get that, and short-term insurance, but across the board. A lot of the products that we've launched in the recurring market space, for people who stay with us for longer periods and so forth, we have an RA, the Echo RA and so forth, actually rewards people for staying with us for longer periods.

      "transcript_text1": "Okay. Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I'm sorry, my voice is a little hoarse because we're in an allergy season and this is where I fit.\r\nThis morning, we reported our financial and operating results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. We are very pleased with these results. You can see that our customers continue to respond favorably to our merchandising strategy to increase same-store sales and our store expansion program continues to fuel the growth of our business across Canada.\r\nI'll let Michael provide you with the details relating to our financial results and our operating initiatives for the quarter. From my perspective, this quarter was defined by the continued organic growth through the  opening of new stores across Canada, as well as the continued uptake of the higher price point merchandise.\r\nIn terms of new stores, we opened 89 net new stores over the past 12 months compared to 93 net new stores in the same period last year, thereby increasing our total store count to 917 stores compared to 828 stores at the end of Q2 last year.\r\nDuring the second quarter of this year, we opened 18 net new stores compared to 22 in the same period last year. Given the pace of new store openings in the first half of the fiscal year, we're now on track to open 70 to 80 stores in fiscal 2015. New stores are being opened at high-quality retail locations across Canada, with most of the new stores located in Ontario and Western Canada, which are markets that continue to be under-penetrated with dollar stores. We continue to focus our efforts on densifying core urban centers in these markets.\r\nFrom a merchandising point of view, sales of $2.50 and $3 price point items continue to grow. Our customers have been responding positively to the value offered by these products. We believe that these higher price points compliment the lower priced items, provide a more value-added basket to the customer.\r\nOverall, we're very satisfied with our current price/mix as it continues to stimulate sales and attract customers into our stores.\r\nLet me now turn the call over to Michael.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. So during the second quarter, we increased our sales by 12% to $572.6 million from $511.3 million in the prior year. The increase in sales was fueled by the opening of 89 net new stores over the past 12 months and a same-store sales increase of 4.2% over and above a 6.2% increase reported in the prior year. The same-store sales increase in Q2 consisted of a 3.1% increase in basket size, which reflects the consumer demand for our higher price point items and a 1.1% increase in the number of transactions.\r\nIn this second quarter, our gross margin was 36.1% of sales compared to 36.6% of sales in Q2 last year. This decrease is partly attributable to slightly lower product margins as we absorb some of the cost increases in order to maintain the compelling value of our products. As we stated earlier this year, we have been managing our gross margin by continually reinvesting in the value proposition offered to our customers. We expect this trend to continue as we target a range between 36% and 37% in fiscal 2015 in order to stimulate continued sales growth.\r\nOur Q2 SG&A as a percentage of sales was 17.1% compared to 17.9% last year. This positive progression is the result of improved labor productivity achieved through initiatives implemented at store level, including improved labor scheduling and reduction of the number of manual inventory counts. These labor productivity initiatives will help offset the impact of the 7.3% minimum wage increase in Ontario that was enacted on June 1, 2014.\r\nWe expect the SG&A to be between 17.1% and 17.5% for the full fiscal -- 2015 fiscal year.\r\nOur depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $2 million this quarter, as a result of the change in estimated useful life of our leasehold improvements, and our store and warehouse equipment as reported in the last quarter. Q2 net earnings increased to $68.9 million or $1.03 per diluted share as compared to $59.8 million or $0.82 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. \r\nCash flows from operations increased to $107 million in Q2 F '15 from $98 million in Q2 F '14. This increase reflects improvement in financial results in the quarter. As previously reported, in the month of May, we modified our capital structure by issuing floating rate senior unsecured notes in the amount of $150 million maturing in May 2017, taking advantage of low variable rate opportunities available on the bond market. The proceeds have been used to repay indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\r\nConcurrently, with the issuance of these notes, we reduced the aggregate amount available under our revolving credit facility from $350 million to $250 million in order to reduce standby fees payable on the unutilized portion.\r\nDuring the quarter, we also repurchased for cancellation, 1,394,040 shares under our normal course issuer bid, which was renewed in June 2014 for another 12-month period for a consideration of $126.9 million at a weighted average price of $91.04 per common share. We also announced today that Dollarama's board has approved a 2-for-1 share split by way of share dividend payable on November 17, 2014.\r\nDollarama is undertaking the share split to ensure that its common shares remain accessible to individual shareholders to increase and broaden its shareholder base and to improve market liquidity for its common shares.\r\nIn terms of our productivity initiatives, we continue to leverage off the benefits of several initiatives rolled out in the stores over the past year, including the reduction in the number of manual paid accounts at store level as we increase our reliance on the scan data for replenishment purposes and the productivity benefits of Kronos, which is used to manage time and attendance, as well as advanced labor scheduling in our stores and warehouses.\r\nAs mentioned in the past, Dollarama's continuously working to improve the efficiency and productivity in stores by making increased use of technology and eliminating non-value-added tax.\r\nOverall, we are very pleased with the performance of the company this quarter and the progress made on our key initiatives that will support profitable growth in the future.\r\nThis ends our formal remarks. And we can now take questions. So operator, I'll turn the call over to you.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I'm sorry, my voice is a little hoarse because we're in an allergy season and this is where I fit.\r\nThis morning, we reported our financial and operating results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. We are very pleased with these results. You can see that our customers continue to respond favorably to our merchandising strategy to increase same-store sales and our store expansion program continues to fuel the growth of our business across Canada.\r\nI'll let Michael provide you with the details relating to our financial results and our operating initiatives for the quarter. From my perspective, this quarter was defined by the continued organic growth through the  opening of new stores across Canada, as well as the continued uptake of the higher price point merchandise.\r\nIn terms of new stores, we opened 89 net new stores over the past 12 months compared to 93 net new stores in the same period last year, thereby increasing our total store count to 917 stores compared to 828 stores at the end of Q2 last year.\r\nDuring the second quarter of this year, we opened 18 net new stores compared to 22 in the same period last year. Given the pace of new store openings in the first half of the fiscal year, we're now on track to open 70 to 80 stores in fiscal 2015. New stores are being opened at high-quality retail locations across Canada, with most of the new stores located in Ontario and Western Canada, which are markets that continue to be under-penetrated with dollar stores. We continue to focus our efforts on densifying core urban centers in these markets.\r\nFrom a merchandising point of view, sales of $2.50 and $3 price point items continue to grow. Our customers have been responding positively to the value offered by these products. We believe that these higher price points compliment the lower priced items, provide a more value-added basket to the customer.\r\nOverall, we're very satisfied with our current price/mix as it continues to stimulate sales and attract customers into our stores.\r\nLet me now turn the call over to Michael.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nThank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. So during the second quarter, we increased our sales by 12% to $572.6 million from $511.3 million in the prior year. The increase in sales was fueled by the opening of 89 net new stores over the past 12 months and a same-store sales increase of 4.2% over and above a 6.2% increase reported in the prior year. The same-store sales increase in Q2 consisted of a 3.1% increase in basket size, which reflects the consumer demand for our higher price point items and a 1.1% increase in the number of transactions.\r\nIn this second quarter, our gross margin was 36.1% of sales compared to 36.6% of sales in Q2 last year. This decrease is partly attributable to slightly lower product margins as we absorb some of the cost increases in order to maintain the compelling value of our products. As we stated earlier this year, we have been managing our gross margin by continually reinvesting in the value proposition offered to our customers. We expect this trend to continue as we target a range between 36% and 37% in fiscal 2015 in order to stimulate continued sales growth.\r\nOur Q2 SG&A as a percentage of sales was 17.1% compared to 17.9% last year. This positive progression is the result of improved labor productivity achieved through initiatives implemented at store level, including improved labor scheduling and reduction of the number of manual inventory counts. These labor productivity initiatives will help offset the impact of the 7.3% minimum wage increase in Ontario that was enacted on June 1, 2014.\r\nWe expect the SG&A to be between 17.1% and 17.5% for the full fiscal -- 2015 fiscal year.\r\nOur depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $2 million this quarter, as a result of the change in estimated useful life of our leasehold improvements, and our store and warehouse equipment as reported in the last quarter. Q2 net earnings increased to $68.9 million or $1.03 per diluted share as compared to $59.8 million or $0.82 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. \r\nCash flows from operations increased to $107 million in Q2 F '15 from $98 million in Q2 F '14. This increase reflects improvement in financial results in the quarter. As previously reported, in the month of May, we modified our capital structure by issuing floating rate senior unsecured notes in the amount of $150 million maturing in May 2017, taking advantage of low variable rate opportunities available on the bond market. The proceeds have been used to repay indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\r\nConcurrently, with the issuance of these notes, we reduced the aggregate amount available under our revolving credit facility from $350 million to $250 million in order to reduce standby fees payable on the unutilized portion.\r\nDuring the quarter, we also repurchased for cancellation, 1,394,040 shares under our normal course issuer bid, which was renewed in June 2014 for another 12-month period for a consideration of $126.9 million at a weighted average price of $91.04 per common share. We also announced today that Dollarama's board has approved a 2-for-1 share split by way of share dividend payable on November 17, 2014.\r\nDollarama is undertaking the share split to ensure that its common shares remain accessible to individual shareholders to increase and broaden its shareholder base and to improve market liquidity for its common shares.\r\nIn terms of our productivity initiatives, we continue to leverage off the benefits of several initiatives rolled out in the stores over the past year, including the reduction in the number of manual paid accounts at store level as we increase our reliance on the scan data for replenishment purposes and the productivity benefits of Kronos, which is used to manage time and attendance, as well as advanced labor scheduling in our stores and warehouses.\r\nAs mentioned in the past, Dollarama's continuously working to improve the efficiency and productivity in stores by making increased use of technology and eliminating non-value-added tax.\r\nOverall, we are very pleased with the performance of the company this quarter and the progress made on our key initiatives that will support profitable growth in the future.\r\nThis ends our formal remarks. And we can now take questions. So operator, I'll turn the call over to you.",
      "transcript_text3": "Traffic, same-store traffic back in positive territory, what were the dynamics behind that and does -- lapping a bunch of target openings in Q3 last year, will that have any impact on your traffic for the remainder of this year?\n\n---\n\nI'm sorry, Perry, this is Michael. Could you -- I had problems hearing you.\n\n---\n\nOkay, so, just a question about the same-store traffic. It's back in positive territory. Just what were this dynamics behind that? And what do you expect for same-store traffic for the next couple of quarters, since you're lapping some target openings from last year?\n\n---\n\nRight, well, the -- as you noticed, we were able to explain, clearly, the traffic in Q4 and Q1, which was related to the weather conditions and so that in Q2, the weather impact that we have back in Q4 and Q1 don't exist, didn't exist in Q2. So certainly, that was a factor. But again, it's making sure that we've got as usual, we've got some good pickup at store level in terms of sales. And that's the best we can do to explain that. It's hard to pinpoint exactly.\n\n---\n\nAnd do you have any expectations for Q3 or Q4?\n\n---\n\nWell we're hoping certainly that, that will continue. So we're doing everything we can to stimulate that. I think it's hard to say right now. We've just started Q3. So we've got some big seasons kicking in soon, Halloween and Christmas. And again, if Mother Nature for Q4 is a bit more on our side, well, I think we should expect positive transactions.\n\n---\n\nAnd what's the current state of real estate opportunities for Dollarama in Canada? And have you had to adjust your criteria over the past year to maintain your store opening pace?\n\n---\n\nWell, it's Larry, Perry. I think the opportunities are similar to what they have been, we had to adjust. Not really, we just recognized that some of the locations that you we're taking are going to cannibalize some others. Those are just a fact of life. And -- but as far as the real estate themselves, it's available. It's available. From an expense point of view, it's similar to about a year ago. We have a lot of renewals now. And every year, we're going to have almost 50, 60, 70 renewals. And they're being renewed at, let's say, less expensive than new stores but more than -- slightly more than what they were 10 years ago, which we would expect.\n\n---\n\nAnd do you feel, Larry, that you'll have to make any alterations to your format or your operations as those opportunities change or as rents increase?\n\n---\n\nNot yet, Perry. I can't predict the future. I'm no good at that. But I can -- let's put it this way. For this year and next year, the balance of this year and next year, that is not the case. If you want me to predict further into time, I can't do that.\n\n---\n\nAll right. And then just one last question, if I could. The improvement in your scale over the past couple of years, has that had a material impact on your purchasing power and your cost of goods?\n\n---\n\nI would say not. I think that generally speaking, especially from the Orient, the size of our orders were such that whether you buy 1,000 -- 5,000 dozen or now you're buying 10,000 dozen of an item, it's not going to improve very much at all. What it may do is domestically, make us more attractive from that point of view. They may be more willing to look at dollar stores in a more favorable light going forward. And I think that's happening in the states, too. You see the big boys, the major companies like P&G and those -- the ilk of those, Rubbermaid, opening up a little bit more and trying to be more creative with Dollar stores than they have in the past but from that point -- having said that, that's just about all I can comment on that.\n\n---\n\nJust if we can look for a moment at your mix in the quarter with 67% of sales from items above $1. That was a very strong increase, both from prior quarter and from prior year. So just wondering whether it's a seasonal issue, whether we saw significantly higher penetration, kind of what was going on there?\n\n---\n\nOkay, hello, Irene. It's Michael. We -- if you look back, the 4 -- 4 years back, you'll see there's a similar bump in Q2 in all of those years and it's 4 or 5 points, if you want. So it went from 62 to 67 so that's an increase of 5. You've seen a similar increase over the past 4 years in Q2. So it's a seasonal thing. Typically in Q1, you have Easter and Valentine, and they sell more lower price point items than when you get into the next quarter.\n\n---\n\nThat's great. So in terms of, let's say, the item count, items priced above $1, that hasn't really changed much?\n\n---\n\nNo, well, the percentage -- no, it hasn't changed much and the percentage is in sales dollars but for the rest, everything remains equal, if you want.\n\n---\n\nThat's great. And I guess we've now had a couple of years of benefit of those -- of the items priced at the $2.50 and $3 price point. As we get into the very important Q4 season, how are you guys thinking, feeling about the offer that you have this year based on the data that you've been able to have from prior years?\n\n---\n\nWell, as buyer of both Halloween and Christmas, there's a marginal increase towards $2.50 and $3, not serious at all, because I personally try to keep that $1 price point, or in and around the $1 price point whether it's $1, $1.25 as much as possible. So I don't think there's going to be a substantial difference in the seasonal offering of Halloween and Christmas in the price point area. We try to maintain it as much as possible, proportionately per price point as in the past, Irene.\n\n---\n\nThat's great. And one more question, if I could. And this goes to productivity initiatives. On the last call, you mentioned that over the next few months, you're going to be -- you're really going to be changing some of the in-store procedures, particularly around cash management, as a result of the rollout of the new POS terminals. I'm just wondering where we stand on that, and whether you've been pleased with returns that you've been getting?\n\n---\n\nOkay, yes. So from a G&A standpoint, here's the latest. We did -- to tell you the truth, we did a bit better than we had anticipated. There's the annualization of the beginning of last year's initiatives. And in that sense, I'd say the initiatives that we have are the ones that are last year initiated, continue this year and there's no real new big initiative that's generating the savings that we expect this year. The new initiatives and you're referred to 1 of them, cash management, it's something that will trickle in over time. It's something that is just at its beginning stage. However -- and that's why we gave you a bit more guidance, a bit more color on the G&A side for the fiscal year '15, ranging between 17.1% and 17.5% -- there are expenses that will be incurred in Q3 and Q4 that were not there last year and they simply relate to different initiatives that we'll be working on. So you should be careful in trending what you're seeing in Q1 and Q2 for Q3 and Q4. So that's why we came out to guide you through to the 17.1% to the 17.5%.\n\n---\n\nIn terms of your merchandise mix, could you sort of refresh us on where you are on seasonal versus consumables and general merchandise? If I recall, sort of back in time, your seasonal was sort of in the mid-teens. Is that still a good proxy to use and could you perhaps speak to the evolution of that mix, even if you're not inclined to be giving specific sort of breakdowns?\n\n---\n\nOkay, so it's Michael. No major change from what was disclosed in the AIF. So 50%-ish general '13, '14 -- that range of seasonal and the balance consumables.\n\n---\n\nMichael, I just want to check on any changes sort of in-year. Could I then just, Michael, switch to inventory productivity, obviously very good numbers on tough comps. You do have some FX-led gross margin pressures on your inventory yield. Could you sort of speak to what kind of runway you have left with respect to the initiatives, or how you view the sort of evolution of your productivity initiatives given some of those challenges with respect to your gross margins?\n\n---\n\nWell, as we stated in the past, we -- now the major initiatives you're all familiar with. And so those are the ones that will, as we turn on the functionalities of those more and more will continue generating benefits in the future. Now I can't speculate on, given that I don't know what the headwinds can be in the future, as to where that will take us. I've given you guidance for this year. Obviously, we are working to reduce that as much as possible. But there's so much that we can predict. And we do expect to have more and more initiatives in the future kicking in. So that we're definitely working on. And so for the currency, that definitely has been a strong headwind. We decided to absorb part of that and not transfer it to the customer so -- and that was expected and communicated to you, and so we will continue to manage that balance between compellingness and return to shareholder.\n\n---\n\nI just wondered if you could discuss a little bit the -- the change in Canada's trade status with China and the increase in tariffs that will be effective, I believe, January 2015. Do you have any estimate of what the magnitude this will impose on your costs, on your COGS? And can you talk a little bit about the philosophy of the company, how you're  going to approach this as a -- are you going to absorb this in your margin or will there be some erosion in the consumer proposition? Can you just talk a little bit about those things.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think that we have to put in the same basket as foreign exchange. It's an extra cost to doing business, and -- as the dollar is, and we're going to handle it the same way. If the duties have increased by 3% or 4%, we're factoring it into our costs and making a decision as we would the FX. So we just can't absorb everything. It's being treated in that -- in a similar fashion. And not every category has been affected but those that are being affected, all our buyers are aware of them. And, again, it's being lumped into -- similar to FX.\n\n---\n\nAnd maybe let me just add a bit of color to that, Peter, by stating that nothing -- that in reality, there's nothing special to signal -- relating to the general pattern [ph] of differential tariffs. Otherwise, it would have been -- if it would have been material, we would have disclosed more information in the MD&A. It's less significant than the currency impact. And again, as Larry said, we're treating it the same way we've been treating forever inflation, wage increases, currency fluctuations and so on. So I hope that helps.\n\n---\n\nRight, and just one other question, if I may. You've talked about in the past, what you think the ultimate store count could be for Dollarama when the -- when your footprint achieves maturation in Canada. I'm just wondering if there's been any change in your view, and how much you could densify the store penetration in urban areas?\n\n---\n\nOkay, so maybe I can begin, Larry, if you want. So  our figure out there right now, and I'll explain how we got to that figure is 1,200. So and 1,200 is our estimate with the current format we know and hopefully, the same financials or economics surrounding that. So that's our view, and we worked that with consultants. So we mapped out the whole country and that's how we arrived at that figure. We have visibility on our current store pipeline. And we -- so we've addressed that more specifically for this year's target. So we -- that's still the number that we're working by.\n\n---\n\nCan you just update us on the percentage of your products now that are priced at those higher price point levels? For example, the percentage of products priced above $2?\n\n---\n\nYes, we don't disclose that. I'm sorry, Derek.\n\n---\n\nOkay, but maybe if I ask it another way, are you guys comfortable with your current range of price points? Is there room to sort of manage some of the increase in costs?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, to be fully clear, it's business as usual. It's -- we haven't changed our approach. You have seen consistently the penetration rate going -- in terms of sales dollars going up, especially in Q2 and then it kind of stabilizes for the -- for a few quarters and then kicks back up. So as of now, there's nothing different that we've done internally.\n\n---\n\nYes, and I would back Michael up on that. I think we're happy at the price ranges that we're in, the mix we're in, and we'll stay with that mix of prices as long as we can. To predict the future, again I can't do that. And am I happy, to answer your question directly, with our price/mix today, I think the answer would be yes.\n\n---\n\nJust back to the tariffs question. So it's one more factor that when you're purchasing, your buyers have to deal with -- so when we're thinking about gross margins going forward, all else being the same, I mean, would you concede that it is definitely a pressure?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think the pressure of the dollar at $1.08 and $1.10 is a pressure, that I would think that a one-time tariff increase is more pressure once, then we know where we're going after that. Bad weather is pressure. Yes. I can't deny that.\n\n---\n\nAnd as you know also, Dave, we've had time to see that coming and so there's definitely -- there's been sufficient time to deal with that question beforehand. But as Larry said, also, it's going to be a one-time pickup and then we continue.\n\n---\n\nIs there any more color you can give us in terms of the percentage of your sales or unit sales or something that will be affected by this?\n\n---\n\nIt's nonmaterial. Otherwise, as I said we would have -- if it would be something special surrounding that, we would have disclosed it in the MD&A.\n\n---\n\nI guess that's the bottom line, it's not material. Just wanting to kind of look further afield. I know  you're comfortable with the range of price points you have now. What about other categories that you may not be in today that might be a bit of a step-out from what you currently offer. Have you given more thought to that or are there initiatives potentially in place that you might want to pilot or categories you might want to pilot in your stores? Could you talk a little bit about the future as -- in terms of your offer?\n\n---\n\nFor me, the future is the present. In terms of -- I'm very happy with our offering today. You've seen so many American dollar stores go to consumables, more consumables that's -- basically, we can't get into pharmaceuticals here, and can't become a Canadian Tire. So I guess, you can go to consumables, we're not interested in doing that. We are -- I think the grocery industry here is very mature and very competitive. I think the offering that we have today and the categories we have are exactly what the customers expect. And we don't want to transition our store into a grocery store, absolutely not. Because we don't -- we like the margins we're making, and we're not favorable to the margins of the grocery industry -- if we keep going that way, which is not our intention. So I think that by just tweaking whether the craft department is strong from 1 year to the other, whether the demand is as strong for craft as it is from 1 year to the other, then we can increase another department by either 5% or 10%, decrease craft by 5% or 10%, but work within the departments we have. I think that answers your question.\n\n---\n\nIt does. And just last one, if I may. Just on the competitive front. Could you talk a little bit about the competitive environment and maybe how it's changed and also maybe again looking into the future, when if or if do you see a need to perhaps become promotional at advertising or some kind of marketing to drive increased traffic?\n\n---\n\nMaybe if I could start, Larry jump in. So we anticipate that competition as has done in the past year will continue increasing, so that's why we're constantly reviewing our processes and trying to get more and more efficient and investing into the product. And so -- and right now, so it's business as usual on that side. We don't see any structural competitive change, major change, but definitely, as we've stated in the past, we compete against it, all the other retailers out there, we don't sell anything unique. Everything we sell, someone else sells, too. So it's a matter of making sure we've got the most compelling value out there.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think Michael has it there.\n\n---\n\nAnd on the advertising marketing front, I mean, it seems inconceivable today, but is that something that you think about, look at, contemplate to help bolster sales at some point in the future?\n\n---\n\nWell, no, that's not something right now. I mean, obviously, the future depends where you are in the future. But for the time being, we're sticking to what we're doing right now.\n\n---\n\nAnd I would agree with that. I don't see it in the future. I -- again, don't want to predict the future but I don't see it in the near future and at all, David, not at all.\n\n---\n\nI just want to go back to the store network opportunity. You mentioned 1,200 stores but on sort of existing template. I know you had been trying smaller stores. Where are you at with the smaller stores? Have you grown into being happy with the performance of those? Or where else would you think you might at some point in time start to think about testing different formats as we get closer to the 1,200 number?\n\n---\n\nI think the smaller store idea comes from the fact that we're trying to get into more Metropolitan areas in Toronto, Montréal and Vancouver, period -- maybe Winnipeg. And because those areas are not covered by dollar stores, they present opportunities and you can't find 10,000, 12,000-foot stores there. You're going to find maybe a 5,000, 6,000, 7,000-foot box. You usually will find that with a basement. So we're taking advantage of those opportunities. We rent the ground level at a price and we -- they throw in the basement obviously -- most of the time. I don't want to give anybody any ideas, but -- so it's not because we're trying to change and try a new format called smaller stores, it's because the opportunities don't exist in those particular areas. The smaller store format may be out there. It's not something we have to think about today, or in the near future again, but I don't see it quite as being as \"rentable\" -- how do you say that in English?\n\n---\n\nProfitable.\n\n---\n\nProfitable as the format we have today, and anything [ph] . So my answer is right now, I'm happy where we are. And I don't know what's going to happen in 5 years.\n\n---\n\nNor do we.\n\n---\n\nI know that.\n\n---\n\nI just wanted to double back on something you said, make sure I heard you correctly with respect to consumables. Do you continue to see consumables as just a category that you'll modestly grow as opposed to taking a different view of consumables and going at it more aggressively?\n\n---\n\nI don't even want to say that we would modestly grow it. We're going to try and keep the proportions in our store as they are today. Again, if craft sells less, we will move somewhere else and would it be to consumables? Maybe, but there's no design to that. It's whatever seems to be in demand by the consumer. So there's no intention to increase the consumable grocery, consumable, non-consumable area in our stores. We like the mix of our offering at the moment. We see that being the same in the future. And again, I don't know what's going to happen in 5 years.\n\n---\n\nJust wondering if you're seeing any benefit related to your value improvement initiatives that you have going on, and if it's possible to measure it or in sales or perhaps customer SAT?\n\n---\n\nThat's a tough one. You're saying, because we're saying that we're not -- we're going to watch or be conscious of our markup, are we seeing more customers? It's too early to predict that. We're saying we're sensitive to that area, where we just don't want to arbitrarily markup everything by the increase in FX and preferential tariffs just because they're there. Eventually, we'll have to catch up, but we are very sensitive to that area of our business. And if we can control it, as well as we have been, that would be most satisfactory. But to say if it's had an impact, it's almost too early for that. And I'm not sure in a year if I can answer that question but at the moment, I couldn't answer that question, Vishal.\n\n---\n\nOkay, got it. In terms of the 36% to 37% gross margin rate that you've given to us, just given some challenges that you highlighted: FX; tariffs, I know you're dealing with that; competitive pressures and perhaps some challenges that you might not foresee at this period of time, is that a hard stop kind of rate that you would try to work towards or are there periods where you could go below that for a period of time, knowing that eventually you could work yourself out of that. Just wondering your thought on that.\n\n---\n\nI think ideally, we'd like to stay within that range. That's what we're aiming for and you're right, we do have all those challenges and by the way, the tariff and the currency we're on the same level of playing field as the other. So it's a matter of balancing that compelling value if you want, but the idea is to stay within that range.\n\n---\n\nI was just wondering if you could speak a bit about the apparel section of the stores. Is that a section that could be expanded, or do you think it's about where it should be?\n\n---\n\nIf anything, it would go the other way. That's a difficult -- we'll call, we'll use your terminology, and say section. It's difficult because there's sizes, there's colors, there's fashion and we threw in modest offerings in the last year or 2. And we've -- again, this is an area that we don't want to expand. Our fixturing is not conducive to it. And if anything, it would go the -- it would contract, it would not expand.\n\n---\n\nAnd then something like the over-the-counter drugs, I'm not exactly sure what you can offer and what you can't offer. But I think I've seen things like Aspirin, I believe, in your store. If not your store, your competitor's store. But how -- what are the limitations on that category?\n\n---\n\nEvery -- it's Neil, Keith. Every province has its own legislation, and so it's a province-by-province discussion as to which over-the-counter drugs are allowed to be sold, but as a category, it's a very small category for us. And we have no intention of growing the category. We offer a limited range of the most consumed, let's say, over-the-counter drugs, and we have no intention of growing it because the sales fall very far off, after the top sellers.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just in terms of the health and beauty assortment, you mentioned the -- some of the big brands are paying more attention to the dollar store channel. Would you see maybe going to more national brands in your health and beauty sort of section?\n\n---\n\nI think we'll take the same approach we have always taken with national brands, which is because they come at a lower markup at all times, we will continue to sprinkle national brands into our imports. But at a very slow pace and just enough to offer a balanced mix.\n\n---\n\nYes, no intention of going there.\n\n---\n\nAnd then I guess a bit out of left field, would you look at the Internet as an Internet offering?\n\n---\n\nKeith, it's Michael. This will be the last question because we still have other analysts to go, sorry. So if you could repeat that question, Keith?\n\n---\n\nI was just wondering whether there's any consideration of going to the Internet?\n\n---\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\nI agree with Michael.\n\n---\n\nI just had a very high-level question at this time. You've had a couple of quarters recently where you've gotten off to a slow start recently and it's typically due to inclement weather. So I really just have two minor questions, maybe one for Neil and then one for Michael. One, was there a notable expansion in your back-to-school offering this year? And then second, Michael, I don't expect you go into much detail, but the late August, early September time frame seemed very busy in the store and I just wonder if it's fair to say the start to this quarter might be a bit more encouraging?\n\n---\n\nSo I'll answer the first question. The first question can be answered rather easily. The assortment has never changed. What we have done is we've made a bigger effort at store level and in store operations to put a better showing of our current and everyday offering on the front end and do a better job of merchandising it. And so it would be to the customer a new look and a new push, although the offering didn't change whatsoever.\n\n---\n\nSeems to work well.\n\n---\n\nOkay, and for the second part, Brian. I can't, obviously, disclose too much, but what I did say earlier is that to-date Q3, nothing unusual. Weather is certainly not a factor as it was in Q4 and Q1. For Q3 at least as of today, and we're just in the beginning of the quarter. We've got Halloween coming up and we're just anxious to see how that will come out and excited by it. And so that's about as much as I can tell you right now.\n\n---\n\nCan you please remind us just your CapEx budget for the year?\n\n---\n\nWe did not disclose a CapEx number. But what we did say is that the total envelope would be less than last year; even though we are growing, the total envelope is expected to be lower. A big part of last year's CapEx was the deployment, the rollout of our NCR cash registered -- registers, so that was a good part of the CapEx, which we don't have this year.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And as you gradually grow into your 1,200 store count, do you have enough capacity to do that or when would you have to envision building a new DC, if at all?\n\n---\n\nYes, absolutely. First of all, just to be clear, Montreal, it's not a capacity issue. The reason we are thinking about a DC or warehouse out west is for economic reasons. And as we get more and more efficient down here, it just pushes back the business case. So we've been telling you for the past 4 years that it's going to be in 3 years and that's still the case now. So nothing new and in fact it's much better that we get more efficient here and push that business case.\n\n---\n\nWe hope we never have to, let's put it that way.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great and maybe just 2 more quick questions, if I can. Can you just remind us your view in the U.S. This is still not an attractive market for Dollarama, is that correct?\n\n---\n\nPardon me?\n\n---\n\nThe U.S. market, I'm just thinking in terms of Dollar General and Family Dollar, if those stores...\n\n---\n\nOh, no, no, no. We're focused in Canada. And we, as you all know, have some -- we're spending a bit of energy in Central America and that's our main focus.\n\n---\n\nOkay, and then lastly, just on credit card, anything up -- new to update us on your thoughts?\n\n---\n\nNo. The debit card penetration continues to increase, obviously that's -- and it doesn't cost us anything that we'll speak to that, and we'll see in the future for the credit card. All right, thank you very much, everyone.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nTraffic, same-store traffic back in positive territory, what were the dynamics behind that and does -- lapping a bunch of target openings in Q3 last year, will that have any impact on your traffic for the remainder of this year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nI'm sorry, Perry, this is Michael. Could you -- I had problems hearing you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nOkay, so, just a question about the same-store traffic. It's back in positive territory. Just what were this dynamics behind that? And what do you expect for same-store traffic for the next couple of quarters, since you're lapping some target openings from last year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nRight, well, the -- as you noticed, we were able to explain, clearly, the traffic in Q4 and Q1, which was related to the weather conditions and so that in Q2, the weather impact that we have back in Q4 and Q1 don't exist, didn't exist in Q2. So certainly, that was a factor. But again, it's making sure that we've got as usual, we've got some good pickup at store level in terms of sales. And that's the best we can do to explain that. It's hard to pinpoint exactly.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nAnd do you have any expectations for Q3 or Q4?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nWell we're hoping certainly that, that will continue. So we're doing everything we can to stimulate that. I think it's hard to say right now. We've just started Q3. So we've got some big seasons kicking in soon, Halloween and Christmas. And again, if Mother Nature for Q4 is a bit more on our side, well, I think we should expect positive transactions.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nAnd what's the current state of real estate opportunities for Dollarama in Canada? And have you had to adjust your criteria over the past year to maintain your store opening pace?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWell, it's Larry, Perry. I think the opportunities are similar to what they have been, we had to adjust. Not really, we just recognized that some of the locations that you we're taking are going to cannibalize some others. Those are just a fact of life. And -- but as far as the real estate themselves, it's available. It's available. From an expense point of view, it's similar to about a year ago. We have a lot of renewals now. And every year, we're going to have almost 50, 60, 70 renewals. And they're being renewed at, let's say, less expensive than new stores but more than -- slightly more than what they were 10 years ago, which we would expect.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nAnd do you feel, Larry, that you'll have to make any alterations to your format or your operations as those opportunities change or as rents increase?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nNot yet, Perry. I can't predict the future. I'm no good at that. But I can -- let's put it this way. For this year and next year, the balance of this year and next year, that is not the case. If you want me to predict further into time, I can't do that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nAll right. And then just one last question, if I could. The improvement in your scale over the past couple of years, has that had a material impact on your purchasing power and your cost of goods?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI would say not. I think that generally speaking, especially from the Orient, the size of our orders were such that whether you buy 1,000 -- 5,000 dozen or now you're buying 10,000 dozen of an item, it's not going to improve very much at all. What it may do is domestically, make us more attractive from that point of view. They may be more willing to look at dollar stores in a more favorable light going forward. And I think that's happening in the states, too. You see the big boys, the major companies like P&G and those -- the ilk of those, Rubbermaid, opening up a little bit more and trying to be more creative with Dollar stores than they have in the past but from that point -- having said that, that's just about all I can comment on that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Irene Nattel (Analysts)】\nJust if we can look for a moment at your mix in the quarter with 67% of sales from items above $1. That was a very strong increase, both from prior quarter and from prior year. So just wondering whether it's a seasonal issue, whether we saw significantly higher penetration, kind of what was going on there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nOkay, hello, Irene. It's Michael. We -- if you look back, the 4 -- 4 years back, you'll see there's a similar bump in Q2 in all of those years and it's 4 or 5 points, if you want. So it went from 62 to 67 so that's an increase of 5. You've seen a similar increase over the past 4 years in Q2. So it's a seasonal thing. Typically in Q1, you have Easter and Valentine, and they sell more lower price point items than when you get into the next quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Irene Nattel (Analysts)】\nThat's great. So in terms of, let's say, the item count, items priced above $1, that hasn't really changed much?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo, well, the percentage -- no, it hasn't changed much and the percentage is in sales dollars but for the rest, everything remains equal, if you want.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Irene Nattel (Analysts)】\nThat's great. And I guess we've now had a couple of years of benefit of those -- of the items priced at the $2.50 and $3 price point. As we get into the very important Q4 season, how are you guys thinking, feeling about the offer that you have this year based on the data that you've been able to have from prior years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWell, as buyer of both Halloween and Christmas, there's a marginal increase towards $2.50 and $3, not serious at all, because I personally try to keep that $1 price point, or in and around the $1 price point whether it's $1, $1.25 as much as possible. So I don't think there's going to be a substantial difference in the seasonal offering of Halloween and Christmas in the price point area. We try to maintain it as much as possible, proportionately per price point as in the past, Irene.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Irene Nattel (Analysts)】\nThat's great. And one more question, if I could. And this goes to productivity initiatives. On the last call, you mentioned that over the next few months, you're going to be -- you're really going to be changing some of the in-store procedures, particularly around cash management, as a result of the rollout of the new POS terminals. I'm just wondering where we stand on that, and whether you've been pleased with returns that you've been getting?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nOkay, yes. So from a G&A standpoint, here's the latest. We did -- to tell you the truth, we did a bit better than we had anticipated. There's the annualization of the beginning of last year's initiatives. And in that sense, I'd say the initiatives that we have are the ones that are last year initiated, continue this year and there's no real new big initiative that's generating the savings that we expect this year. The new initiatives and you're referred to 1 of them, cash management, it's something that will trickle in over time. It's something that is just at its beginning stage. However -- and that's why we gave you a bit more guidance, a bit more color on the G&A side for the fiscal year '15, ranging between 17.1% and 17.5% -- there are expenses that will be incurred in Q3 and Q4 that were not there last year and they simply relate to different initiatives that we'll be working on. So you should be careful in trending what you're seeing in Q1 and Q2 for Q3 and Q4. So that's why we came out to guide you through to the 17.1% to the 17.5%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenric Tyghe (Analysts)】\nIn terms of your merchandise mix, could you sort of refresh us on where you are on seasonal versus consumables and general merchandise? If I recall, sort of back in time, your seasonal was sort of in the mid-teens. Is that still a good proxy to use and could you perhaps speak to the evolution of that mix, even if you're not inclined to be giving specific sort of breakdowns?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nOkay, so it's Michael. No major change from what was disclosed in the AIF. So 50%-ish general '13, '14 -- that range of seasonal and the balance consumables.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenric Tyghe (Analysts)】\nMichael, I just want to check on any changes sort of in-year. Could I then just, Michael, switch to inventory productivity, obviously very good numbers on tough comps. You do have some FX-led gross margin pressures on your inventory yield. Could you sort of speak to what kind of runway you have left with respect to the initiatives, or how you view the sort of evolution of your productivity initiatives given some of those challenges with respect to your gross margins?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nWell, as we stated in the past, we -- now the major initiatives you're all familiar with. And so those are the ones that will, as we turn on the functionalities of those more and more will continue generating benefits in the future. Now I can't speculate on, given that I don't know what the headwinds can be in the future, as to where that will take us. I've given you guidance for this year. Obviously, we are working to reduce that as much as possible. But there's so much that we can predict. And we do expect to have more and more initiatives in the future kicking in. So that we're definitely working on. And so for the currency, that definitely has been a strong headwind. We decided to absorb part of that and not transfer it to the customer so -- and that was expected and communicated to you, and so we will continue to manage that balance between compellingness and return to shareholder.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Sklar (Analysts)】\nI just wondered if you could discuss a little bit the -- the change in Canada's trade status with China and the increase in tariffs that will be effective, I believe, January 2015. Do you have any estimate of what the magnitude this will impose on your costs, on your COGS? And can you talk a little bit about the philosophy of the company, how you're  going to approach this as a -- are you going to absorb this in your margin or will there be some erosion in the consumer proposition? Can you just talk a little bit about those things.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes, I think that we have to put in the same basket as foreign exchange. It's an extra cost to doing business, and -- as the dollar is, and we're going to handle it the same way. If the duties have increased by 3% or 4%, we're factoring it into our costs and making a decision as we would the FX. So we just can't absorb everything. It's being treated in that -- in a similar fashion. And not every category has been affected but those that are being affected, all our buyers are aware of them. And, again, it's being lumped into -- similar to FX.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nAnd maybe let me just add a bit of color to that, Peter, by stating that nothing -- that in reality, there's nothing special to signal -- relating to the general pattern [ph] of differential tariffs. Otherwise, it would have been -- if it would have been material, we would have disclosed more information in the MD&A. It's less significant than the currency impact. And again, as Larry said, we're treating it the same way we've been treating forever inflation, wage increases, currency fluctuations and so on. So I hope that helps.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Sklar (Analysts)】\nRight, and just one other question, if I may. You've talked about in the past, what you think the ultimate store count could be for Dollarama when the -- when your footprint achieves maturation in Canada. I'm just wondering if there's been any change in your view, and how much you could densify the store penetration in urban areas?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nOkay, so maybe I can begin, Larry, if you want. So  our figure out there right now, and I'll explain how we got to that figure is 1,200. So and 1,200 is our estimate with the current format we know and hopefully, the same financials or economics surrounding that. So that's our view, and we worked that with consultants. So we mapped out the whole country and that's how we arrived at that figure. We have visibility on our current store pipeline. And we -- so we've addressed that more specifically for this year's target. So we -- that's still the number that we're working by.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Derek Dley (Analysts)】\nCan you just update us on the percentage of your products now that are priced at those higher price point levels? For example, the percentage of products priced above $2?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes, we don't disclose that. I'm sorry, Derek.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Derek Dley (Analysts)】\nOkay, but maybe if I ask it another way, are you guys comfortable with your current range of price points? Is there room to sort of manage some of the increase in costs?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, to be fully clear, it's business as usual. It's -- we haven't changed our approach. You have seen consistently the penetration rate going -- in terms of sales dollars going up, especially in Q2 and then it kind of stabilizes for the -- for a few quarters and then kicks back up. So as of now, there's nothing different that we've done internally.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes, and I would back Michael up on that. I think we're happy at the price ranges that we're in, the mix we're in, and we'll stay with that mix of prices as long as we can. To predict the future, again I can't do that. And am I happy, to answer your question directly, with our price/mix today, I think the answer would be yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nJust back to the tariffs question. So it's one more factor that when you're purchasing, your buyers have to deal with -- so when we're thinking about gross margins going forward, all else being the same, I mean, would you concede that it is definitely a pressure?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes. I think the pressure of the dollar at $1.08 and $1.10 is a pressure, that I would think that a one-time tariff increase is more pressure once, then we know where we're going after that. Bad weather is pressure. Yes. I can't deny that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nAnd as you know also, Dave, we've had time to see that coming and so there's definitely -- there's been sufficient time to deal with that question beforehand. But as Larry said, also, it's going to be a one-time pickup and then we continue.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nIs there any more color you can give us in terms of the percentage of your sales or unit sales or something that will be affected by this?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nIt's nonmaterial. Otherwise, as I said we would have -- if it would be something special surrounding that, we would have disclosed it in the MD&A.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nI guess that's the bottom line, it's not material. Just wanting to kind of look further afield. I know  you're comfortable with the range of price points you have now. What about other categories that you may not be in today that might be a bit of a step-out from what you currently offer. Have you given more thought to that or are there initiatives potentially in place that you might want to pilot or categories you might want to pilot in your stores? Could you talk a little bit about the future as -- in terms of your offer?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nFor me, the future is the present. In terms of -- I'm very happy with our offering today. You've seen so many American dollar stores go to consumables, more consumables that's -- basically, we can't get into pharmaceuticals here, and can't become a Canadian Tire. So I guess, you can go to consumables, we're not interested in doing that. We are -- I think the grocery industry here is very mature and very competitive. I think the offering that we have today and the categories we have are exactly what the customers expect. And we don't want to transition our store into a grocery store, absolutely not. Because we don't -- we like the margins we're making, and we're not favorable to the margins of the grocery industry -- if we keep going that way, which is not our intention. So I think that by just tweaking whether the craft department is strong from 1 year to the other, whether the demand is as strong for craft as it is from 1 year to the other, then we can increase another department by either 5% or 10%, decrease craft by 5% or 10%, but work within the departments we have. I think that answers your question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nIt does. And just last one, if I may. Just on the competitive front. Could you talk a little bit about the competitive environment and maybe how it's changed and also maybe again looking into the future, when if or if do you see a need to perhaps become promotional at advertising or some kind of marketing to drive increased traffic?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nMaybe if I could start, Larry jump in. So we anticipate that competition as has done in the past year will continue increasing, so that's why we're constantly reviewing our processes and trying to get more and more efficient and investing into the product. And so -- and right now, so it's business as usual on that side. We don't see any structural competitive change, major change, but definitely, as we've stated in the past, we compete against it, all the other retailers out there, we don't sell anything unique. Everything we sell, someone else sells, too. So it's a matter of making sure we've got the most compelling value out there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes, I think Michael has it there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nAnd on the advertising marketing front, I mean, it seems inconceivable today, but is that something that you think about, look at, contemplate to help bolster sales at some point in the future?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nWell, no, that's not something right now. I mean, obviously, the future depends where you are in the future. But for the time being, we're sticking to what we're doing right now.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nAnd I would agree with that. I don't see it in the future. I -- again, don't want to predict the future but I don't see it in the near future and at all, David, not at all.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nI just want to go back to the store network opportunity. You mentioned 1,200 stores but on sort of existing template. I know you had been trying smaller stores. Where are you at with the smaller stores? Have you grown into being happy with the performance of those? Or where else would you think you might at some point in time start to think about testing different formats as we get closer to the 1,200 number?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI think the smaller store idea comes from the fact that we're trying to get into more Metropolitan areas in Toronto, Montréal and Vancouver, period -- maybe Winnipeg. And because those areas are not covered by dollar stores, they present opportunities and you can't find 10,000, 12,000-foot stores there. You're going to find maybe a 5,000, 6,000, 7,000-foot box. You usually will find that with a basement. So we're taking advantage of those opportunities. We rent the ground level at a price and we -- they throw in the basement obviously -- most of the time. I don't want to give anybody any ideas, but -- so it's not because we're trying to change and try a new format called smaller stores, it's because the opportunities don't exist in those particular areas. The smaller store format may be out there. It's not something we have to think about today, or in the near future again, but I don't see it quite as being as \"rentable\" -- how do you say that in English?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nProfitable.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nProfitable as the format we have today, and anything [ph] . So my answer is right now, I'm happy where we are. And I don't know what's going to happen in 5 years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nNor do we.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI know that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nI just wanted to double back on something you said, make sure I heard you correctly with respect to consumables. Do you continue to see consumables as just a category that you'll modestly grow as opposed to taking a different view of consumables and going at it more aggressively?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI don't even want to say that we would modestly grow it. We're going to try and keep the proportions in our store as they are today. Again, if craft sells less, we will move somewhere else and would it be to consumables? Maybe, but there's no design to that. It's whatever seems to be in demand by the consumer. So there's no intention to increase the consumable grocery, consumable, non-consumable area in our stores. We like the mix of our offering at the moment. We see that being the same in the future. And again, I don't know what's going to happen in 5 years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vishal Shreedhar (Analysts)】\nJust wondering if you're seeing any benefit related to your value improvement initiatives that you have going on, and if it's possible to measure it or in sales or perhaps customer SAT?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nThat's a tough one. You're saying, because we're saying that we're not -- we're going to watch or be conscious of our markup, are we seeing more customers? It's too early to predict that. We're saying we're sensitive to that area, where we just don't want to arbitrarily markup everything by the increase in FX and preferential tariffs just because they're there. Eventually, we'll have to catch up, but we are very sensitive to that area of our business. And if we can control it, as well as we have been, that would be most satisfactory. But to say if it's had an impact, it's almost too early for that. And I'm not sure in a year if I can answer that question but at the moment, I couldn't answer that question, Vishal.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vishal Shreedhar (Analysts)】\nOkay, got it. In terms of the 36% to 37% gross margin rate that you've given to us, just given some challenges that you highlighted: FX; tariffs, I know you're dealing with that; competitive pressures and perhaps some challenges that you might not foresee at this period of time, is that a hard stop kind of rate that you would try to work towards or are there periods where you could go below that for a period of time, knowing that eventually you could work yourself out of that. Just wondering your thought on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nI think ideally, we'd like to stay within that range. That's what we're aiming for and you're right, we do have all those challenges and by the way, the tariff and the currency we're on the same level of playing field as the other. So it's a matter of balancing that compelling value if you want, but the idea is to stay within that range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nI was just wondering if you could speak a bit about the apparel section of the stores. Is that a section that could be expanded, or do you think it's about where it should be?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nIf anything, it would go the other way. That's a difficult -- we'll call, we'll use your terminology, and say section. It's difficult because there's sizes, there's colors, there's fashion and we threw in modest offerings in the last year or 2. And we've -- again, this is an area that we don't want to expand. Our fixturing is not conducive to it. And if anything, it would go the -- it would contract, it would not expand.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nAnd then something like the over-the-counter drugs, I'm not exactly sure what you can offer and what you can't offer. But I think I've seen things like Aspirin, I believe, in your store. If not your store, your competitor's store. But how -- what are the limitations on that category?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Rossy (Executives)】\nEvery -- it's Neil, Keith. Every province has its own legislation, and so it's a province-by-province discussion as to which over-the-counter drugs are allowed to be sold, but as a category, it's a very small category for us. And we have no intention of growing the category. We offer a limited range of the most consumed, let's say, over-the-counter drugs, and we have no intention of growing it because the sales fall very far off, after the top sellers.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nAnd then just in terms of the health and beauty assortment, you mentioned the -- some of the big brands are paying more attention to the dollar store channel. Would you see maybe going to more national brands in your health and beauty sort of section?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Rossy (Executives)】\nI think we'll take the same approach we have always taken with national brands, which is because they come at a lower markup at all times, we will continue to sprinkle national brands into our imports. But at a very slow pace and just enough to offer a balanced mix.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes, no intention of going there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nAnd then I guess a bit out of left field, would you look at the Internet as an Internet offering?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nKeith, it's Michael. This will be the last question because we still have other analysts to go, sorry. So if you could repeat that question, Keith?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nI was just wondering whether there's any consideration of going to the Internet?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI agree with Michael.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Morrison (Analysts)】\nI just had a very high-level question at this time. You've had a couple of quarters recently where you've gotten off to a slow start recently and it's typically due to inclement weather. So I really just have two minor questions, maybe one for Neil and then one for Michael. One, was there a notable expansion in your back-to-school offering this year? And then second, Michael, I don't expect you go into much detail, but the late August, early September time frame seemed very busy in the store and I just wonder if it's fair to say the start to this quarter might be a bit more encouraging?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Rossy (Executives)】\nSo I'll answer the first question. The first question can be answered rather easily. The assortment has never changed. What we have done is we've made a bigger effort at store level and in store operations to put a better showing of our current and everyday offering on the front end and do a better job of merchandising it. And so it would be to the customer a new look and a new push, although the offering didn't change whatsoever.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Morrison (Analysts)】\nSeems to work well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nOkay, and for the second part, Brian. I can't, obviously, disclose too much, but what I did say earlier is that to-date Q3, nothing unusual. Weather is certainly not a factor as it was in Q4 and Q1. For Q3 at least as of today, and we're just in the beginning of the quarter. We've got Halloween coming up and we're just anxious to see how that will come out and excited by it. And so that's about as much as I can tell you right now.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Li (Analysts)】\nCan you please remind us just your CapEx budget for the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nWe did not disclose a CapEx number. But what we did say is that the total envelope would be less than last year; even though we are growing, the total envelope is expected to be lower. A big part of last year's CapEx was the deployment, the rollout of our NCR cash registered -- registers, so that was a good part of the CapEx, which we don't have this year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Li (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And as you gradually grow into your 1,200 store count, do you have enough capacity to do that or when would you have to envision building a new DC, if at all?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes, absolutely. First of all, just to be clear, Montreal, it's not a capacity issue. The reason we are thinking about a DC or warehouse out west is for economic reasons. And as we get more and more efficient down here, it just pushes back the business case. So we've been telling you for the past 4 years that it's going to be in 3 years and that's still the case now. So nothing new and in fact it's much better that we get more efficient here and push that business case.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWe hope we never have to, let's put it that way.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Li (Analysts)】\nOkay, great and maybe just 2 more quick questions, if I can. Can you just remind us your view in the U.S. This is still not an attractive market for Dollarama, is that correct?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nPardon me?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Li (Analysts)】\nThe U.S. market, I'm just thinking in terms of Dollar General and Family Dollar, if those stores...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nOh, no, no, no. We're focused in Canada. And we, as you all know, have some -- we're spending a bit of energy in Central America and that's our main focus.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Li (Analysts)】\nOkay, and then lastly, just on credit card, anything up -- new to update us on your thoughts?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo. The debit card penetration continues to increase, obviously that's -- and it doesn't cost us anything that we'll speak to that, and we'll see in the future for the credit card. All right, thank you very much, everyone.",

Let me also tell you that in terms of expansion, our space growth and online launches for the year are on track. We have opened stores in 40 different markets over the period, demonstrating the global reach of Inditex business model. We have continued our global online rollout and added Mexico to our platform. The next step will be the launch of online sales in South Korea later this month. We will also open Zara in Tmall in China in October. We continue to see significant growth opportunities for Inditex globally.\r\nIn terms of growth, we have maintained a strong expansion.

New selling space contributed 6.5% to total sales. The translation of sales in currencies different to the euro has reduced reported sales growth by 4 percentage points due to the lower exchange rate versus our reporting currency. In line with our comments at the time of our fiscal 2015 results, we expect the impact of currency translation to diminish markedly over 2014. So currencies remain at current levels.

In the case of Zara, let me tell you that comparable sales growth is in line with the group average in the period. I would like to highlight that both Oysho and Zara Home have performed very well.

      "transcript_text3": "My question is regarding the domestic market. Apparently, with the figures you published, I believe that you posted very strong growth, probably in the region of 6% like-for-like, we estimate, which has surprised us. Would you please elaborate a little more on this? Which are the main drivers of this very unexpected growth in the domestic market?\n\n---\n\nThank you. Well, first of all, I would like to say, as we were saying during the presentation, that during this first half, our global like-for like sales growth has been 4.5%, and we have achieved a positive like-for-like sales growth in all the geographies. Regarding Spain, we were saying in the full year results presentation that in the second half of last year, Spain had returned to growth, and this growth have accelerated during the first half of the year. As you were saying, sales growth in Spain in the first half is around 6%. Well, what we can say is that we continue to be very active in the market. We have had very relevant openings, of course, in Madrid, this relevant Zara flagship in San Sebastián. Now very recently, we have opened a very, very relevant Massimo Dutti flagship also in Madrid in Serrano Street in the former Zara building. So we'll continue very active in the Spanish market.\n\n---\n\nI wonder if you could make a comment on your inventory growth. That seems to be around 21% over 1 year and nearly 40% over 2 years, if I've done my math correctly. Maybe I haven't, but it would be great if you could comment on that, please. And then secondly, could you flag the exposure of the group to markets such as Russia, Ukraine and Poland, please?\n\n---\n\nWell, what I would tell you is that you are -- regarding the inventory; we have talked several times about this in previous results presentation. The inventory position is just a snapshot for us. What is relevant is the level of commitment at any point in time. What I can tell you regarding the autumn/winter season is that -- you have seen, well, the trading update. Store sales in local currencies are growing 10%. We feel comfortable about the evolution of our business and no concern from that point of view. And you were mentioning different countries. What -- also, the answer is that you are mentioning countries in which we are present since many years ago. We always have a medium- and long-term approach. Our business is developing in normal conditions in all the different geographies.\n\n---\n\nAnd just on that inventory point then. So you maintain your plus or minus 50 basis points guidance. We hear your stable gross margin guidance. How do you think about the second half given, obviously, the developing dynamic for autumn/winter?\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, I would answer you that our guidance for the second half in terms of gross margin would be a stable gross margin for the second half. You know that the gross margin is a combination of many different things. It has to do, of course, with markups, with markdowns, with fashion trends, with product mix. It has to do with currencies. In the first half, we have had a relevant currency impact on the gross margin. We have -- you have a currency impact on sales on the gross margin. And then thinking about the second half, what we could tell you at this stage of the season is a stable gross margin for the second half of the year. Let me remind that even in the first half, gross profit has grown 4%, which is a relevant figure, having in mind everything which has been going on with currencies.\n\n---\n\nJust a quick question on your online sales. Can you give us a sense of the trends there in terms of the growth of online and maybe a bit of color on certain of the key markets and start-ups, U.S. online sales growth, please?\n\n---\n\nWell, thank you. You know that we do not like to elaborate very much regarding online-specific sales evolution in the different markets. What we can tell you is that we continue very satisfied with the evolution of our online business. In fact, what -- the best way to say it is that we continue very satisfied with the evolution of our multi-channel business because for us, this multi-channel approach, as we have talked in previous conference calls, is something very, very relevant. Our online and store operations are fully integrated from every point of view. You may have in-store deliveries, in-store returns. You could even order online from many of our stores. So it's something which is fully integrated. We have a lot of people buying online, but we have also a lot of customers seeing the product online, buying in the stores. So this approach is very relevant. We continue with the rollout. Very recently, we have also begun our online operations in Mexico. We will begin next week in South Korea. And then in October, we will begin -- well, of course, we are already present in China with our online business, but we will also offer online sales through Tmall, which is something that we think is going to be quite relevant. What I can tell you is that we continue growing regarding our online sales in a significantly way in all the different geographies, of course. In terms of the most relevant markets, it has to do with the -- what are the most relevant markets, in general, for online. So -- and you were mentioning the U.S. Of course, the U.S. is a very relevant market because online penetration is very strong in the market. So it's also a very relevant market for us. So this approach with space growth plus online growth is what we are planning to do in the coming years.\n\n---\n\nTwo follow-up questions, please. In the world of online, are you finding that promotional levels have intensified over such the recent times?\n\n---\n\nPromotional levels, you mean?\n\n---\n\nOnline.\n\n---\n\nYes, and the -- in -- on the online.\n\n---\n\nNo, not -- no, not for us. You know how do we manage our online business. We are offering our full range of product -- no, no, nothing in a particular way.\n\n---\n\nAnd you don't feel that competition is sort of putting -- sort of forcing such as increased competitive promotional pressure?\n\n---\n\nNo, no. Normal environment, I would say, no.\n\n---\n\nCould you elaborate a little bit on the net cash evolution for the -- what are your expectations -- or expect net cash to increase considering the decline that you have in the first half?\n\n---\n\nWell, José, in general, as you know, the cash position has to do with the evolution of the business, with a calendar of CapEx in a very special way and the dividend payments. And the dividend payments have increased 10%. So those are the key drivers.\n\n---\n\nI am fully aware that there's plenty of drivers for gross margin, but I was just wondering if we were to look about second quarter performance, whether there is some weight from currency, whether there's anything specific within there that we should be thinking about that can give us a bit of comfort that second half gross margin will be more stable as you've talked to earlier?\n\n---\n\nWell, the first point, Simon, I think is gross profit again has increased 4% to EUR 4.7 billion on top of EUR 4.5 billion. So the evolution is positive, right. In the first half, as we have mentioned, obviously, currency has been an issue, okay, because there is a significant translation effect. All in all, what we can tell you is that taking into account that the business model of the company provides a very strong stability, what we expect for the second half is a stable gross margin, and this is very much the spending we would like to make forward.\n\n---\n\nAnd were there any kind of particular currencies within there in the second quarter that are worth highlighting?\n\n---\n\nI think that the main driver is the strength of the euro, not to any specific currency to talk about because we're present in 88 markets. As you can imagine, we cannot get in a detailed analysis of a small factor over a period.\n\n---\n\nMy question is about the cost efficiency that you've been demonstrating really for the last 18 months. It's been extremely impressive, and you've been able to grow costs slower than space growth. And I was wondering if you could just talk about how much of that is due to operational efficiencies relative to currency translation\n\n---\n\nWell, what I would like -- first of all, as we were saying during the presentation, we'll continue managing tightly our costs. What -- the main driver behind cost growth is always space growth, as you perfectly know. Then there is a second driver, which has to do with the evolution of sales because of variable -- we have part of our costs, a relevant part of them, which are variable. And then, of course, we also have currencies. And currency impact on costs is more or less half of currency impact on sales. So what we can tell you is that we'll continue trying to find efficiencies in the way we operate our company. This is a permanent effort. And if you analyze what -- coming from our results, what could be our like-for-like cost growth, you can see how tightly managed are our costs.\n\n---\n\nI've got 2 questions. First of all, does your stable gross margin guidance in the second half mean absolutely flat? Or do you mean plus or minus 50 basis points as you often do with stable? And then the second question is about currency. I think your full year guidance is a 3% currency translation hit to sales, but with euro having weakened recently, might it be nearer to 2%?\n\n---\n\nWell, regarding your first question, we always warn because the gross margin is not mathematics. It has to do with many different things. So we always -- when we say a stable gross margin, we are always thinking about plus, minus 50 basis points. It's impossible to know at the beginning of any season what the exact, final figure is going to be the gross margin. So what we can tell you is a stable gross margin for the second half, but we all know that, for us, stable means plus, minus 50 basis points. Regarding currencies, what we could say at this stage is that we continue expecting, in terms of currency impact for the year, a similar impact as we had in the previous year, which is around 3%. And I think because of -- there is some volatility regarding currencies. So we prefer to maintain this assumption, instead of estimating every week what is going to be the final currency impact on -- during the year. You know that we manage our business for the long term in all the different geographies. So, of course, this is something we monitor, but we are not obsessed with what would be the evolution of currencies in every particular week.\n\n---\n\nJust one question, really. The 4.5% like-for-like, could you split that down between volume and value, please?\n\n---\n\nIt's mainly volume-driven. Globally, we have maintained our prices stable in the different markets. Globally -- there could be some elements here and there, but globally, we have maintained our prices stable in the different markets. So as usually, with our like-for-like sales growth, it's mainly volume-driven.\n\n---\n\nOne question from me on the Americas. So I've noticed that the percentage of sales coming from the Americas has declined in the first half, and I wanted to find out if this is mainly FX-driven. Is it less store expansion in that region? Or have you seen of any Europe growing faster than the Americas? Any more color you can give there, please.\n\n---\n\nYes, it's mainly currency-driven. What we were saying during the presentation is that we have had positive like-for-like sales growth in all the geographies. So it's mainly currency-driven.\n\n---\n\nAnd in terms of your store growth, the way that we should think about it, if we think your 8% to 10% space growth -- sorry, do you think your 8% to 10% guidance will -- is it focused market? Other than China, is U.S. one of them?\n\n---\n\nIn the U.S., our approach in terms of growth is a combination between store openings and online sales growth. We have had relevant openings during the period, particularly. Well, we could mention different openings, but I could mention the opening in Miami in Lincoln Road. So we have had relevant openings during the period. And this is our idea. We will continue opening relevant stores in the different U.S. cities, and then combining these with our online business. If you will remember, we were talking in previous presentations that regarding online in the U.S.; we used to have one stockroom in the East Coast. Now we are operating a second one in the West Coast in order to serve -- enable the way our customers in the West Coast. So we'll continue operating our business through this combination between store openings or enlargement of existing stores because this is something which is also relevant in the U.S. market, and then online growth. So this is the approach we have for the online market for the U.S. market. So you should expect store openings, and then you should expect online growth. And then in Mexico, of course, we'll continue opening stores every year. In Brazil, we'll continue opening stores every year. So a combination -- in general terms, we're doing a store growth and then online growth. When you analyze the evolution in this first half, as I was mentioning to you before, it is mainly driven because of the currency impact.\n\n---\n\nThis is Vick Mohan in for Omar. Could you talk a little bit about competition, especially in your home European markets, and whether you're seeing a rise in your Indian competition?\n\n---\n\nI would say that all the markets are very competitive, and this is always the case. And this is an environment in which we -- I don't know what word to use, but we like to operate in a very competitive market. I think competition is good for everybody. It's good also for us because you need to innovate permanently, so nothing special to mention, but as always, all the markets are very competitive.\n\n---\n\nIf -- at constant currency, if inventory growth was 21% in the first half year-on-year, but what it's been on a constant-currency basis, please?\n\n---\n\nCould you repeat your question, Rebecca?\n\n---\n\nInventory growth in the first half was 21%. What was it on a constant-currency basis?\n\n---\n\nNot very different, not very different, but again, I would not put too much emphasis on inventory. That commitment is very much the figure we follow. This is a snapshot at the beginning of the season. So I wouldn't read anything specific at all in the sense that to look at the figure for the first 6 weeks when we're talking of 6 months is not very relevant. So we don't have any significant concern then. Commitment remains very tightly managed.\n\n---\n\nCould you just talk about your online delivery proposition? You obviously launched in the U.S. with free delivery. You're charging in Europe. What will you do around the rest of the world as you roll out?\n\n---\n\nIt's something we need to analyze on -- in every market. There are several countries in which we have free deliveries. There also several countries in which we have free deliveries who have bought a certain amount. There are countries in which we have a small charge for the standard delivery. In all the countries, we offer express delivery. We offer free delivery in every market when you have in-store delivery. In every market, we have free returns. So we analyze each market. We decide what to do depending also on what is the environment in each of the different markets. So it's something very flexible, and it's something that can change in any particular market at any point in time, so something very flexible depending on the competitive environment in any of the different markets.\n\n---\n\nAnd what impact does that have on basket size?\n\n---\n\nNo, it doesn't have a relevant impact in terms of basket size. The -- we have -- I do know that the average basket size -- I would have thought previously about that, is about the average basket size in the store. And what we have seen is that this is not having any relevant impact. You also have these free deliveries in our stores. And the basket size when you have in-store deliveries is very similar to the basket size when you have a home delivery. So it doesn't have any relevant impact from that point of view\n\n---\n\nOkay. Could I just ask a follow-up on Russia? What currency are your rents mainly denominated in?\n\n---\n\nIn the local currency.\n\n---\n\nThe majority of them are in local currency, are they?\n\n---\n\nYes, yes.\n\n---\n\nWe have a couple of questions from the webcast platform. The first question is regarding Uterqüe. You mentioned during the presentation that Uterqüe has experienced very strong like-for-likes over the first half 2014. Can you provide us with some more color behind the performance of these full markets?\n\n---\n\nWell, what we were saying during the presentation that in this first half, we are seeing a strong like-for-like sales growth. We have presented a new image of the stores that have been quite well received pending all the collections. So what we can say is that this year, in the summer season -- and the same can be said about the beginning of the autumn/winter season, we are quite happy with the evolution of Uterqüe and the performance of Uterqüe from both point of view, the new store image and then the acceptance, how well-received have been the collections by our customers.\n\n---\n\nThe next question. You made a comment during the AGM regarding the implementation of RFID at Inditex. Can you give us with an update regarding the progress of this project?\n\n---\n\nYes. As you were saying, we presented this project during our Shareholders' Meeting. We think it is a very relevant project. It is -- we decided to present it because the project is already completed from the point of view of the investment. Of course, now we are through the rollout, implementing this RFID in all our stores. There are some very innovative features regarding our RFID implementation because the RFID is incorporated into the alarm pack. It is freely reusable. There is no waste, no additional operating expenses. As we were saying, CapEx has already been incurred. And for us, the project is very relevant from the point of view of customer service, from the point of view of inventory management, from the point of view of the productivity of the stores. At the end of this year, RFID will have been implemented in around 1,000 Zara stores. It will be completed in all Zara stores by 2016. And then progressively, we'll be introducing in all the other brands, so a very relevant project for us. It is improving the way we operate and we manage our stores. From the point of view of CapEx, the CapEx has already been incurred. And the way we have implemented this project, it hasn't any relevant impact regarding operating expenses. So we think it's a very positive project from the point of view of customer service, from the point of view of inventory management.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you, and that concludes the questions from the webcast platform.\n\n---\n\nWell, thank you very much. And of course, we will be ready to continue answering any questions you may have through our capital markets team. Thank you very much.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Juan Ros Padilla (Analysts)】\nMy question is regarding the domestic market. Apparently, with the figures you published, I believe that you posted very strong growth, probably in the region of 6% like-for-like, we estimate, which has surprised us. Would you please elaborate a little more on this? Which are the main drivers of this very unexpected growth in the domestic market?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nThank you. Well, first of all, I would like to say, as we were saying during the presentation, that during this first half, our global like-for like sales growth has been 4.5%, and we have achieved a positive like-for-like sales growth in all the geographies. Regarding Spain, we were saying in the full year results presentation that in the second half of last year, Spain had returned to growth, and this growth have accelerated during the first half of the year. As you were saying, sales growth in Spain in the first half is around 6%. Well, what we can say is that we continue to be very active in the market. We have had very relevant openings, of course, in Madrid, this relevant Zara flagship in San Sebastián. Now very recently, we have opened a very, very relevant Massimo Dutti flagship also in Madrid in Serrano Street in the former Zara building. So we'll continue very active in the Spanish market.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nI wonder if you could make a comment on your inventory growth. That seems to be around 21% over 1 year and nearly 40% over 2 years, if I've done my math correctly. Maybe I haven't, but it would be great if you could comment on that, please. And then secondly, could you flag the exposure of the group to markets such as Russia, Ukraine and Poland, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, what I would tell you is that you are -- regarding the inventory; we have talked several times about this in previous results presentation. The inventory position is just a snapshot for us. What is relevant is the level of commitment at any point in time. What I can tell you regarding the autumn/winter season is that -- you have seen, well, the trading update. Store sales in local currencies are growing 10%. We feel comfortable about the evolution of our business and no concern from that point of view. And you were mentioning different countries. What -- also, the answer is that you are mentioning countries in which we are present since many years ago. We always have a medium- and long-term approach. Our business is developing in normal conditions in all the different geographies.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nAnd just on that inventory point then. So you maintain your plus or minus 50 basis points guidance. We hear your stable gross margin guidance. How do you think about the second half given, obviously, the developing dynamic for autumn/winter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nYes. Well, I would answer you that our guidance for the second half in terms of gross margin would be a stable gross margin for the second half. You know that the gross margin is a combination of many different things. It has to do, of course, with markups, with markdowns, with fashion trends, with product mix. It has to do with currencies. In the first half, we have had a relevant currency impact on the gross margin. We have -- you have a currency impact on sales on the gross margin. And then thinking about the second half, what we could tell you at this stage of the season is a stable gross margin for the second half of the year. Let me remind that even in the first half, gross profit has grown 4%, which is a relevant figure, having in mind everything which has been going on with currencies.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Steegers (Analysts)】\nJust a quick question on your online sales. Can you give us a sense of the trends there in terms of the growth of online and maybe a bit of color on certain of the key markets and start-ups, U.S. online sales growth, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, thank you. You know that we do not like to elaborate very much regarding online-specific sales evolution in the different markets. What we can tell you is that we continue very satisfied with the evolution of our online business. In fact, what -- the best way to say it is that we continue very satisfied with the evolution of our multi-channel business because for us, this multi-channel approach, as we have talked in previous conference calls, is something very, very relevant. Our online and store operations are fully integrated from every point of view. You may have in-store deliveries, in-store returns. You could even order online from many of our stores. So it's something which is fully integrated. We have a lot of people buying online, but we have also a lot of customers seeing the product online, buying in the stores. So this approach is very relevant. We continue with the rollout. Very recently, we have also begun our online operations in Mexico. We will begin next week in South Korea. And then in October, we will begin -- well, of course, we are already present in China with our online business, but we will also offer online sales through Tmall, which is something that we think is going to be quite relevant. What I can tell you is that we continue growing regarding our online sales in a significantly way in all the different geographies, of course. In terms of the most relevant markets, it has to do with the -- what are the most relevant markets, in general, for online. So -- and you were mentioning the U.S. Of course, the U.S. is a very relevant market because online penetration is very strong in the market. So it's also a very relevant market for us. So this approach with space growth plus online growth is what we are planning to do in the coming years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nTwo follow-up questions, please. In the world of online, are you finding that promotional levels have intensified over such the recent times?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nPromotional levels, you mean?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ignacio Izuzquiza Fernández (Executives)】\nOnline.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nYes, and the -- in -- on the online.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nNo, not -- no, not for us. You know how do we manage our online business. We are offering our full range of product -- no, no, nothing in a particular way.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nAnd you don't feel that competition is sort of putting -- sort of forcing such as increased competitive promotional pressure?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nNo, no. Normal environment, I would say, no.\n\n---\n\n【質問: José Rito (Analysts)】\nCould you elaborate a little bit on the net cash evolution for the -- what are your expectations -- or expect net cash to increase considering the decline that you have in the first half?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ignacio Izuzquiza Fernández (Executives)】\nWell, José, in general, as you know, the cash position has to do with the evolution of the business, with a calendar of CapEx in a very special way and the dividend payments. And the dividend payments have increased 10%. So those are the key drivers.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Bowler (Analysts)】\nI am fully aware that there's plenty of drivers for gross margin, but I was just wondering if we were to look about second quarter performance, whether there is some weight from currency, whether there's anything specific within there that we should be thinking about that can give us a bit of comfort that second half gross margin will be more stable as you've talked to earlier?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ignacio Izuzquiza Fernández (Executives)】\nWell, the first point, Simon, I think is gross profit again has increased 4% to EUR 4.7 billion on top of EUR 4.5 billion. So the evolution is positive, right. In the first half, as we have mentioned, obviously, currency has been an issue, okay, because there is a significant translation effect. All in all, what we can tell you is that taking into account that the business model of the company provides a very strong stability, what we expect for the second half is a stable gross margin, and this is very much the spending we would like to make forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Bowler (Analysts)】\nAnd were there any kind of particular currencies within there in the second quarter that are worth highlighting?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ignacio Izuzquiza Fernández (Executives)】\nI think that the main driver is the strength of the euro, not to any specific currency to talk about because we're present in 88 markets. As you can imagine, we cannot get in a detailed analysis of a small factor over a period.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jamie Merriman (Analysts)】\nMy question is about the cost efficiency that you've been demonstrating really for the last 18 months. It's been extremely impressive, and you've been able to grow costs slower than space growth. And I was wondering if you could just talk about how much of that is due to operational efficiencies relative to currency translation\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, what I would like -- first of all, as we were saying during the presentation, we'll continue managing tightly our costs. What -- the main driver behind cost growth is always space growth, as you perfectly know. Then there is a second driver, which has to do with the evolution of sales because of variable -- we have part of our costs, a relevant part of them, which are variable. And then, of course, we also have currencies. And currency impact on costs is more or less half of currency impact on sales. So what we can tell you is that we'll continue trying to find efficiencies in the way we operate our company. This is a permanent effort. And if you analyze what -- coming from our results, what could be our like-for-like cost growth, you can see how tightly managed are our costs.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anne Critchlow (Analysts)】\nI've got 2 questions. First of all, does your stable gross margin guidance in the second half mean absolutely flat? Or do you mean plus or minus 50 basis points as you often do with stable? And then the second question is about currency. I think your full year guidance is a 3% currency translation hit to sales, but with euro having weakened recently, might it be nearer to 2%?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, regarding your first question, we always warn because the gross margin is not mathematics. It has to do with many different things. So we always -- when we say a stable gross margin, we are always thinking about plus, minus 50 basis points. It's impossible to know at the beginning of any season what the exact, final figure is going to be the gross margin. So what we can tell you is a stable gross margin for the second half, but we all know that, for us, stable means plus, minus 50 basis points. Regarding currencies, what we could say at this stage is that we continue expecting, in terms of currency impact for the year, a similar impact as we had in the previous year, which is around 3%. And I think because of -- there is some volatility regarding currencies. So we prefer to maintain this assumption, instead of estimating every week what is going to be the final currency impact on -- during the year. You know that we manage our business for the long term in all the different geographies. So, of course, this is something we monitor, but we are not obsessed with what would be the evolution of currencies in every particular week.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Warwick Okines (Analysts)】\nJust one question, really. The 4.5% like-for-like, could you split that down between volume and value, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nIt's mainly volume-driven. Globally, we have maintained our prices stable in the different markets. Globally -- there could be some elements here and there, but globally, we have maintained our prices stable in the different markets. So as usually, with our like-for-like sales growth, it's mainly volume-driven.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nOne question from me on the Americas. So I've noticed that the percentage of sales coming from the Americas has declined in the first half, and I wanted to find out if this is mainly FX-driven. Is it less store expansion in that region? Or have you seen of any Europe growing faster than the Americas? Any more color you can give there, please.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nYes, it's mainly currency-driven. What we were saying during the presentation is that we have had positive like-for-like sales growth in all the geographies. So it's mainly currency-driven.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nAnd in terms of your store growth, the way that we should think about it, if we think your 8% to 10% space growth -- sorry, do you think your 8% to 10% guidance will -- is it focused market? Other than China, is U.S. one of them?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nIn the U.S., our approach in terms of growth is a combination between store openings and online sales growth. We have had relevant openings during the period, particularly. Well, we could mention different openings, but I could mention the opening in Miami in Lincoln Road. So we have had relevant openings during the period. And this is our idea. We will continue opening relevant stores in the different U.S. cities, and then combining these with our online business.

So a combination -- in general terms, we're doing a store growth and then online growth. When you analyze the evolution in this first half, as I was mentioning to you before, it is mainly driven because of the currency impact.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vickram Mohan (Analysts)】\nThis is Vick Mohan in for Omar.
