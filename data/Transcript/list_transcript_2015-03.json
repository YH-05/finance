      "transcript_text1": "Good morning, London, and good afternoon, Hong Kong.\r\n2014 was a challenging year, and our performance was disappointing, but it was also a year when we took decisive action to refocus our strategy and to reposition the group for the future. As a board, we continue to believe that there are significant opportunities for the group, in the medium- to long-term, across our footprint, and that is why we've been careful not to take any knee-jerk reactions which may damage the long-term prospects of the business. However, at the same time, we need to be mindful that there are significant factors impacting our current performance which cannot be ignored: the imperative to build capital across the industry, the need for ongoing investment in enhancing our systems and processes associated with conduct and compliance; and the need to change the shape of our business to fit the demands of the current economic and regulatory landscape. As a consequence of this, the board has recently endorsed a number of priority areas.\r\nThe first of these, we embarked on last week by providing clarity on our governance, our leadership and succession plans. And today, we are going further by highlighting a number of other priorities. These are taking steps to build on our capital levels, enhancing our return on equity and continuing to improve our conduct and compliance capabilities. Andy and Peter will go into some detail on each of these priorities shortly, but let me again stress the board's determination to reshape the business, to restore the group's performance and to fully realize the opportunities in our markets.\r\nAt the same time, we are determined to continue to raise the bar on conduct and compliance to ensure that the Here for good, our brand promise, is firmly embedded in the DNA of the bank worldwide. And whilst we're comfortable with our current capital position, the board does want to improve our capital trajectory going forward. And so today, you will hear a lot about the actions we're taking around risk-weighted assets, reducing costs and business disposals, all of which are aimed at strengthening both our Common Equity Tier 1 levels and our trajectory going forward. \r\nWe believe we've identified strong levers to manage capital accretion over time. And therefore, the board is recommending a final dividend for 2014 of $0.572, resulting in a total annual dividend of $0.86, which is the same level of dividends per share as last year.\r\nLet me now comment on how we remunerate our people, most of whom are not located here in the U.K. As this chart shows, for several years, we have significantly increased the amount paid out to shareholders by way of dividend whilst at the same time consecutively reducing the amount paid out in bonuses despite increasing staff numbers over this period. And in 2014, we are again proposing to pay out more to our shareholders by way of dividends than we pay out in bonuses. This disciplined approach to managing variable compensation has created significant competitive pressures in some of our key markets. We are, of course, mindful of the external sentiment in some markets on bankers' pay and conscious of our disappointing performance in 2014, but it is essential that we remain able to pay competitively in the markets we operate in and where wage inflation on average is around 5%. Our people are much sought after by our competition, and we're acutely conscious of the importance of retaining and attracting the best talent as we look to execute on our strategy. It also goes without saying that, consistent with past practice, we will only reward our people for good performance as well as for their good behaviors.\r\nNow taking all these factors into account and reflecting our performance in 2014, the bonus pool is down on last year by 9% and is 27% lower than in 2011. In light of the disappointing performance of the group, those executive directors on the PLC board throughout the year came to the conclusion that they should show leadership by not taking a bonus for 2014.\r\nSo to conclude, a brief comment on last week's announcement detailing our comprehensive package of board and leadership changes.\r\nI'd like to take this opportunity to thank Peter, on behalf of the board, for the immense contribution he has made to the success of the group over the past 13 years both as Chief Executive -- as Group Chief Executive and as Group Finance Director. Since becoming Group Chief Executive in 2006, the group has more than doubled in size and has been consistently profitable. His leadership and insight over a period of huge change and challenge for the entire industry ensures that he leaves the group well placed to achieve its full potential as one of the world's leading financial institution.\r\nI would also like to thank Jaspal for his very considerable contributions to the business over the past 16 years and to thank other long-serving board members who are stepping down this year and who have done so much to help position this great bank for the future. A very big thank you to each and every one of you.\r\nNow we're extremely fortunate to have Bill Winters, one of the most accomplished and respected bankers in the world today, taking over as Chief Executive from Peter in June, to drive the bank's next chapter of growth. Bill brings substantial financial experience from leading a very successful global business and has an exceptional understanding of the global regulatory and conduct environment. He's also a proven leader with a strong track record in nurturing and developing talent. I'm personally thrilled that Bill is joining our bank at this strategically important time, and I'm sure we all wish him well in his new role.\r\nOn that note, let me hand over to Andy, who will tell you more about the 2014 results and share with you some of his own observations and thoughts on group performance since he joined Standard Chartered just last year.\n\n---\n\nThank you, John. And good morning or afternoon to everybody. Before I go into the detail of numbers for 2014, I want to share with you a few perspectives 9 months after joining the bank back in the summer of last year. One thing it has certainly not been, in line with Peter's original promise, has been dull. During that time, I've traveled extensively to some of our biggest markets, Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea and India; some of our smaller markets, Kenya and Tanzania; as well as our major network hubs in New York and London. I have met with several hundred of our senior people, as well as addressing town hall meetings in multiple locations. The universal takeaways have been that our people are immensely proud of working for the bank, but, depending in part on geography, they are feeling bruised by both the recent trading performance and the external commentary. They are determined to learn from the past year but then put it behind them and move forwards.\r\nIn many senses, arriving in the summer of last year was excellent timing, coinciding as it did with the newly established client and product groups commencing their individual strategies, which were subsequently articulated at our Investor Meeting in Hong Kong in November. Pulling together a 300-slide presentation on the bank's strategy had not been something on my original first-100-day checklist. Since then, I have been heavily involved with Peter, Mike and the executive team in turning those plans into clear operational and financial targets for each part of the business for the next 3 years, all of which culminated in the rollout of group-wide scorecards by the third week in January, something that Peter will refer to later.\r\nDuring that time, I've also met with many of you and clearly, very clearly, heard your concerns about business momentum, quality of the credit book, costs, U.S. regulation and capital adequacy; as well as requests for a more realistic tone in our external market communications. To the latter point, we have, I believe, made the quality of information in our IMS much more insightful; terminated the somewhat ambiguous preclose statements; and at the November Investor Meeting, provided clearer insights into our business, especially relating to returns and the quality of the loan book. In today's press release, we have refreshed many of the disclosures, which hopefully make the risks section, in particular, more informative.\r\nUnsurprisingly, I have spent a considerable amount of time over the last few months with Richard Goulding and the team in risk, really getting to understand exactly how our overall operational risk processes work, how proactive we are in dealing with cyclical or sectoral changes and how we go about provisioning. What has been very clear to me is that our loan portfolio is extremely diverse and quite difficult to meaningfully draw conclusions from based upon high-level external assumptions. In the vast majority of instances, our exposures are to a client, not to a specific product, and hence the assessment on recoverability is much more about the robustness of that client's business model to a downturn, not to depressed prices per se. This involves a detailed upfront assessment by our teams on a client-by-client basis, not something easily capable of extrapolation from external data.\r\nAs well as individual assessments, the group also undertakes extreme stress-testing exercises to scan for vulnerabilities. Many of the areas currently experiencing heightened stress levels were flagged as concerns several years ago and have been actively managed since. This clearly doesn't mean we will avoid impairment. And indeed this year, the year-end review has resulted in a number of provisions being taken, particularly in the commodities sector, to ensure that, as best we can see based upon currently available information, we are appropriately provisioned.\r\nI've also gone through these extensively with the new head of our group special asset management team; as well as our external auditors, KPMG. The majority of the issues relate to advances made several years ago, and very few relate to recent credit decisions. We've also taken a number of assertive actions around other impairment for the year. We have written off the remaining Korea goodwill, have topped-up a number of commodity exposure impairments, have written-down a number of strategic and associated investments, as well as booking a goodwill charge on the exit of the institutional cash equities business.\r\nOne of the things that has given me comfort as I have looked through the loan book is the group's observed recovery range -- rates, which are very supportive of the net exposures after provisioning and after collateral. I was also of the view very early on that we could do more on costs. And hence, we preannounced the $400 million top-dollar target for 2015, which is now well on track. With, in retail alone, around 2,000 jobs having been cut or announced and completed in the last 3 months of 2014, and a further 2,000 expected during 2015. We are now turning our attention to identifying cost opportunities for 2016 and beyond and have, as you will have seen, announced a 3-year target to take $1.8 billion of costs out the business, comprising underlying savings of between $400 million and $500 million per annum and the impact of any divestments.\r\nBefore I turn to the slides themselves, one final comment. It was clear to me that our financial framework was no longer suitable for the phase we are in, in particular the continuing regulatory imperative for the sector overall, ourselves included, by building more capital headroom and the need to upgrade the robustness of our conduct and financial crime capabilities. We have, therefore, decided to target 2 overarching objectives going forwards: firstly, to get our CET1 ratio between 11% and 12% in 2015 and thereafter; and secondly, to get our return on equity above 10% in the medium term. Unfortunately, several of the actions that solve for the former put more stress on the latter and vice versa, hence why we have sequenced the priorities in this way. Indeed, a simple way of showing underlying return on equity of the group will be to separate out the parts that are clearly dragging the overall performance. Korea and the bank levy alone would take our return on equity nearly into double digits. However, life is clearly not that simple, and Peter will discuss in more detail the 2 primary actions regarding RWA and costs that we will focus on to deliver on these priorities in a moment.\r\nSo on to the slides. The numbers, as you know, are disappointing with a 2% reduction in income and a 30% reduction in statutory profit before tax, in part driven by higher impairment charges. I will go through several of the numbers on this slide separately, so let me just comment on 1 or 2 of the items that are more lumpy in nature and less reflective of the underlying performance of the franchise.\r\nWe have incurred restructuring costs of $181 million in the year, approximately 1/4 related to redundancy programs in Korea, with the balance reflecting the realignment of the client segments and products groups under the new organization structure, including a number of business exits. Our business -- our bank levy has risen a significant 56% to $366 million. In August, as you know, we reached a settlement with the U.S. authorities of $300 million. And more recently, we carried out a detailed review of the outlook for our Korean business. Whilst we are encouraged by the recent PDRS trends and hence the opportunity to improve upon the business' recent disappointing financial performance, it is nonetheless currently lossmaking. And hence, we are writing off the remaining goodwill of $726 million, on top of the $1 billion write-down last year. This write-off has no cash effect to the group, nor does it affect the capital ratios, as goodwill is already fully deducted for prudential purposes. The main normalizing items are therefore the Korean impairment, U.S. settlement and own credit adjustment. On this basis, adjusted profit before tax for the year was $5.2 billion, down 25%.\r\nSo moving on to the next slide. Normalized earnings per share were, as a consequence, down by 28% to $1.46. And the normalized return on equity was 7.8%.\r\nThe balance sheet remains in good shape. Our Basel III transitional CET1 ratio of 10.5% is flat in the second half despite absorbing 30 basis points of headwinds, including model changes and the further foreseeable dividend, as well as having taken greater provisions on commodities exposures, as I referred to. As I mentioned earlier, 2014 returns are clearly not what we aspire to, and key to those will be improving and executing on the client segment strategies. Peter is going to update you on these in a moment, but before that, let's look at our performance in a little bit more detail, starting with income by segment.\r\nAs you can see from this slide, notwithstanding decisions to de-risk our portfolio in areas such as retail unsecured and commodity financing, we restricted the reduction in the top line to 2%. The biggest reduction in our year-on-year income performance was in the Commercial Clients segment, where income fell by $322 million. This was driven by current-year private equity valuation reductions relative to realized gains in the previous year, weaker demand for renminbi products in financial markets as well as exiting a significant number of relationships whose risk-and-return equation no longer met our requirements.\r\nIncome from Corporate and Institutional Clients was down 2% or $225 million. Continued weakness in financial markets and management actions taken to optimize returns on the balance sheet offset gains on the exit of a number of private equity investments. The business has shown early progress on the metrics we set out in November last year, with an improvement in the multimarket ratio from 2.6 to 2.8 and the multiproduct ratio increasing from 5.9 to 6.3. Risk-weighted assets increased by 10%, primarily due to the impact of Basel III and policy, methodology and model changes. Excluding this impact, risk-weighted assets were flat.\r\nIncome from Private Banking clients was up 4%, driven by strong performance in Greater China. It is worth noting that we have exited a number of subscale businesses in the period, and excluding the impacts of these discontinued operations, income from Private Banking clients was up 6%, driven by net new money inflows of $6 billion. The business has also increased the number of relationship managers during the year and added 1,300 new clients, including early successes from the internal client referral program.\r\nRetail client income of just over $6 billion was up 2% on the year. Strong growth in income from the Priority segment, up 16%, offset a decline in the personal segment, which was down 5%. This is consistent with our strategy to focus on more affluent segments and de-risk our unsecured portfolios, particularly in Korea. We continued to reshape our business in Korea and, during the year, have exited 60 branches and almost 300 staff. Excluding Korea, retail client income was up 4%.\r\nSo turning now and looking at income by product.\r\nTransaction Banking income of $3.8 billion was down 3% year-on-year. Trade finance, which accounts for just over half of this income, was down 5%. Margins have remained broadly stable, though average assets were down 4% in the second half, reflecting a slower trade environment and continued assertive management of low-returning risk-weighted assets. Cash Management and Custody, which accounts for the remaining half of the income, was flat year-on-year. Margins were driven lower by the significant liquidity that persists across our key markets, but this is offset by good growth in average balances and record clearing levels as we continue to win multicountry Transaction Banking mandates.\r\nIncome from Financial Markets was down $456 million year-on-year. In foreign exchange, strong volume growth in cash FX, up 47%, and FX options, up 89%, has been offset by ongoing spread compression. In Rates, low volatility and low interest rates continue to impact both volumes and spreads.\r\nCorporate Finance income was down 1% year-on-year, as high levels of liquidity resulted in slightly increased repayment levels. Wealth Management income was up 17% and is benefiting in particular from the Prudential Bancassurance partnership as well as an accelerating shift towards servicing high-net-worth individuals in the retail client segment, as I mentioned earlier.\r\nIncome from Retail Products was down 4% or $206 million year-on-year, impacted predominantly by our continued de-risking of the unsecured portfolio. Within this, income from cards, personal loans and unsecured lending was down 8% or $212 million year-on-year following a 14% reduction in balances to $20.5 billion. Income from mortgages was down $59 million or 6% as property market cooling measures muted volume growth in a number of markets.\r\nThe other category, on the slide, includes income from assets and liability management, lending and portfolio management and Principal Finance. Asset and liability management income was up 19% to $653 million and benefited from the more efficient deployment of surplus renminbi customer deposits, the majority of which was recorded in the first half. Second half income of $233 million is more reflective of the underlying performance. \r\nLending and portfolio management income fell 4%, reflecting lower balances as we exited some lower-returning relationships. And finally, Principal Finance income was up 17% year-on-year. The gains on the exit of a number of private equity investments, at positive multiples, more than offset lower revaluations.\r\nSo moving to expenses.\r\nAs you can see from this slide, underlying costs of $10.2 billion increased by less than 3%. During the year, we have faced further regulatory cost increases of $237 million, which -- without which our overall underlying costs would have been flat. To offset these increases, as well as inflation of nearly $400 million, the group has delivered cost efficiencies in 2014 of some $200 million, of which we are now doubling to over $400 million as our target for 2015. We are now working, as I said earlier, on the pipeline of further sustainable productivity improvements for 2016 and 2017. Taken as a whole, these represent a significant program of initiatives that will deliver sustainable cost savings of some $1.8 billion in total over the next 3 years. Peter will pick this up later.\r\nTurning to impairment. Loan impairment is up $524 million or 32% to $2.1 billion for the full year. Approximately 40% of this arises in the retail client segment, which is 3% lower than the previous year, benefiting primarily from improved PRS -- PDRS in Korea. The remaining $1.2 billion loan impairment arises in the Corporate and Institutional and Commercial Clients segments, where since we spoke to you last, further weakness in commodity markets has impacted a small number of exposures that we have been closely monitoring for some time.\r\nOther impairment, excluding goodwill, was $403 million. The main increase in the year included the impairment on the China warehouse fraud mentioned in the half year results and impairments of certain strategic and associate investments.\r\nGiven the further deterioration in commodity markets this year, I want to cover our commodity portfolio in a little more detail.\r\nOur total commodity exposure is now $55 billion or 10% of the group's overall total net exposure. The vast majority of our commodities exposures is trade related, evidenced by the short tenure of the book, with 74% being less than 1 year. This allows us to act quickly to changes in the external environment. In fact, our commodities exposure is down $6 billion in the second half of the year alone, as we actively managed the portfolio.\r\nWhen thinking about vulnerability to a sustained bear market, there are some important factors to consider. 60% of our exposure is to global majors; large state-owned enterprises; or are investment grade, which we expect to prove highly resilient even through a sustained downturn. A further 32% is short-term or trade-finance related at less than 1 year in tenure, again, highly resilient. 4% is to fund structured Project or Corporate Finance with very high levels of collateral. This leaves just 4% of the portfolio potentially more vulnerable to prolonged weakness in commodity prices.\r\nSo what actions have we taken to manage the risks here? We have conducted an in-depth review of our Traders portfolio. And as a result, we have exited 150 relationships since early 2013, have reduced exposures since the half year by $2 billion or 6% and have focused upon commodity traders with sound internal risk management capabilities and good access to other liquidity sources. 2 years ago, we identified which clients in our Producers portfolio might be potentially vulnerable to a sharp correction in commodity prices. We have actively managed those names, since reducing exposure, taking additional collateral and exiting relationships where necessary. Whilst we have seen nonperforming loan formation, reflecting the extremely low level of some commodity prices, refreshed stress tests have identified no new names to add to this list.\r\nTurning to oil specifically, which represents around half of our commodity exposure. 98% of our oil producer exposure is either to state-owned enterprises or to \"low cost of extraction\" companies who have a breakeven price below the current market price. The real situation may be somewhat better than this, in fact, as we have conservatively allowed no slowdown in these companies' capital expenditure, no refinancing, no depletion of cash balances for a period of 1 year. We simply do not have exposures to \"high cost of extraction\" parts of the industry.\r\nThe final point of context for our portfolio is that many of our markets actively benefit from lower commodity prices. Even oil-producing markets like Ghana are net importers of oil, and markets like India are receiving a real boost from lower prices.\r\nIn conclusion, we have conducted a very thorough review of our commodities exposure, and the main areas of potential vulnerability lie in a very small proportion of our portfolio, which we have been very actively managing.\r\nSo what about the overall credit quality of the book? As I have looked across the group over the past 9 months, there are a number of observations that I want to make and share with you that give me comfort in the credit quality overall.\r\nFirstly, the book is becoming increasingly diverse. No single industry now accounts for more than 16% of corporate loans and advances, and our top 20 exposures have reduced as a proportion of our CET1. The book remains predominantly short dated, with nearly 2/3 of Corporate and Institutional and Commercial Clients exposures being less than 1 year. We are holding increased levels of collateral, up 4%, with high levels of collateralization for longer-term and noninvestment-grade loans.\r\nOver 40% of the corporate portfolio is investment grade, and this mix is increasing. Whilst early alerts are not always the most accurate predictor of subsequent impairment, it is nonetheless encouraging that recent early alert trends have been stable. Delinquency rates in our retail book have started to improve following continued de-risking of the unsecured book and an improved PDRS trend in Korea.\r\nCG accounts are stable compared to the half year. In fact, they're down compared to the half year. And whilst nonperforming loans are up slightly, 4%, in the first half, the increase does relate to a number of accounts we have been actively managing for some time. And finally, market risk is predominantly client driven and remains very low in absolute terms.\r\nSo in summary, the current elevated level of loan impairment reflects increases arising from India and China as well as our commodity exposures in these and some other markets, including Indonesia and Africa. We flagged these areas of risk early and have been proactively managing them for some time.\r\nSo to change topic and move on to the balance sheet.\r\nThe balance sheet is in good shape. Very diversified, well structured and highly liquid, with deposits up $29 billion or 6% in the second half alone. We already more than meet the minimum Basel III requirements for both the net stable funding ratio and the liquidity coverage ratio.\r\nLoans and advances to customers are down $16 billion or 5% in the second half, driven by continued de-risking of the retail unsecured portfolio; reducing exposure to the energy, mining and quarrying sectors; more assertive management of low-returning relationships; high levels of liquidity resulting in early repayments; and currency translation. Actually, on a constant currency basis, loans and advances to customers are flat year-on-year. As a result, our advance-to-deposit ratio is now below 70% and our liquid asset ratio is 32.2%.\r\nIn summary, we finished the year with our balance sheet in good shape.\r\nTurning to capital. Our transitional CET1 ratio of 10.5% is flat in the second half. This is after absorbing a combined 30-basis-point deduction for model, methodology and policy changes; the foreseeable dividend; and the settlement with U.K. -- U.S. authorities; as well as the impact of the increased U.K. bank levy. This is a clear demonstration of the group's strong underlying equity generation of some 50 basis points in the year, above our historic trend of 30 basis points. Furthermore, our endpoint CET1 ratio of 10.7% is 200 basis points above our known minimum requirement, with capacity therefore to absorb future add-ons such as the countercyclical buffer, as it is phased-in.\r\nFurthermore, we have maintained a strong level of total loss-absorbing capacity or TLAC, above 20%. And our leverage ratio at 4.5% is significantly ahead of our 2019 requirement. We currently plan to issue AT1 capital this year, as we look to manage total capital efficiently and build our AT1 levels over time to the amount permitted by applicable regulations.\r\nClearly, we are in an environment where we need to manage capital requirements dynamically over time, balancing it with delivering returns to shareholders. So where are our priorities going forwards? Simply put, our financial priorities are to accrete capital to a CET1 ratio of between 11% and 12% in 2015 and thereafter and to deliver return on equity of over 10% in the medium-term. These priorities replace the flexed financial framework set out in November 2013.\r\nThe regulatory environment continues to evolve, typically requiring the industry to hold increasing levels of capital. Against this backdrop, the group will prioritize actions that organically enhance the CET1 ratio whilst acknowledging there will be an impact on the return on equity. Based on our current best view of the regulatory outlook, we are very confident in our ability to reach a CET1 capital ratio of between 11% and 12% in 2015 and thereafter.\r\nBuilding the group's return on equity to an attractive level, sustainably above the cost of equity, is key to delivering long-term value to shareholders and remains our focus.\r\nSo to summarize.\r\nThe board took action to clarify leadership and succession last week. And today, we are setting out the actions around our commitments on capital, returns and also around conduct and compliance. 2015 will be about accelerating management action and executing the plans we set out in November for the 4 client segments.\r\nWe are prioritizing organic capital accretion and through a series of planned asset disposals and business exits as well as continued management of low-returning relationships, we expect to release $25 million to $30 billion in RWA over the next 2 years. To protect returns, we are targeting $1.8 billion of sustainable cost savings over the next 3 years. And we continue to raise the bar on conduct and compliance. We have a number of material initiatives underway, which Peter will go through in more detail.\r\nCombined, these represent a significant program of initiatives that will create a platform from which we can build the returns to an attractive level. Peter will talk you through each of these forward commitments in a little bit more detail now.\r\nSo close to. Whilst 2014 was a very difficult year, the staff around the bank and the management are absolutely determined to restore the group's performance levels.\r\nThank you, and I'll now hand back to Peter.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Andy. And good morning to those of you in London, and good afternoon to those in Hong Kong.\r\nAndy has covered our 2014 numbers, and I am not going to repeat what he said. It was a tough year. Our performance was disappointing, and we are acutely aware of the impact of this for you, our shareholders. We faced a perfect storm: a negative sentiment towards emerging markets, a sharp drop in commodity prices, persistent low interest rates and surplus liquidity, low volatility and a welter of regulatory challenges. As a result, we saw intense pressure on margins and volumes, a significant uptick in impairment and a sharp increase in regulatory-related costs.\r\nAnd of course, it wasn't all about external factors. Some of the decisions we took in the past look less good now than they did at the time, Korea, for example, which in 2014 made a loss, before tax, of $145 million. Not everything we did was as well executed as it should have been. For example, the upgrade of our transaction surveillance systems back in 2007, shortcomings here ultimately resulted in the civil penalty of $300 million we paid last August.\r\nWe've taken a range of actions in response to the way our world has changed, some tactical, some more fundamental. I know some of you think we should have acted faster or more dramatically. Perhaps that's right. Perhaps we haven't explained properly what we've done. The fact is that, in 2014, we did more to change the way the bank is run than in any year since when I first arrived. We've overhauled the strategy, making it sharper and more focused. We've reconfigured the organization to get better alignment behind our strategic priorities. We've attacked the cost base. We've redeployed capital. We've disposed of or are in the process of disposing 15 underperforming and nonstrategic business. We've de-risked portfolios and segments such as unsecured or correspondent banking. We've stepped up the pace of our program to raise the bar on conduct.\r\nAnd while some of these changes actually made 2014 performance worse since we sacrificed income or increased investment, I'm confident that the way we are reshaping the bank will get us back to a trajectory of profitable, sustainable growth, delivering returns above our cost of capital and thus driving the share price.\r\nI should make clear that we are not counting on the world to do us favors, so while we do expect a gradual return to a more normal interest rate environment, and this year, we've already seen more volatility in currency markets, we're not counting on headwinds turning to tailwinds to boost our performance. We are focused on the levers that we control, the things that we can do to improve returns, increase productivity and return to growth.\r\nOur performance priorities are clear. First, we must dispel concerns about capital, hence the clear target of an 11% to 12% CET1 ratio in 2015 and thereafter. Second, we must improve returns. Hence, we are setting a target ROE of over 10% in the medium term so that we are sustainably delivering above our cost of capital. This will take a bit of time to achieve, not least because, as Andy said, the actions we're taking to strengthen the CET1 ratio make this more difficult.\r\nSo what do we have to do to make this happen? I'll answer that by addressing the obvious big areas of shareholder concern, capital, costs, credit quality and income growth; expanding a bit on what we've done already; and more importantly, telling you what we are doing now. I'll also talk about conduct since this, too, is vitally important to the future success of the bank. As I do this, I want to make clear that each element fits into an overall agenda of action and that all of these initiatives are already captured in the scorecards of the individual clients and product groups, functions and geographies across the bank.\r\nOn capital, we start from a strong position. In terms of our CET1 ratio, at 10.7% on an end-state basis, we have a 200-basis-point buffer relative to known regulatory requirements. We weathered the Bank of England's stress tests comfortably. We're strongly placed from a leverage and TLAC perspective.\r\nHowever, we understand market concerns about forward trajectory given the uncertainties about how regulatory requirements will evolve. Although it is impossible to be definitive, a combination of RWA inflation and escalating expectations do point to a continuing upward drift in regulatory requirements. That's why we put such a focus on capital accretion so that we can absorb regulatory changes and fund growth whilst also improving the ratio. We accreted some 50 basis points in 2014, 20 basis points in the first half, 30 in the second half. To achieve this, we cut some $9 billion of low-returning RWA, largely from Corporate and Institutional Clients, and saved another $2 billion from disposals.\r\nWe now plan to pull these levers even harder. Over the next 2 years, we plan to cut a further $25 billion to $30 billion of RWA from low-returning client relationships and underperforming businesses. We are making good progress on this already, and by taking these actions, we are confident that we can achieve our target CET1 ratio of 11% to 12% in 2015 and thereafter.\r\nCosts. In 2014, we kept a tight grip on costs. Whilst headline expenses went up 5%, over half of this increase was due to the U.K. bank levy and restructuring costs attached to the very cost actions we are taking. Underlying expenses went up less than 3%, driven largely by increased spend on regulatory and conduct priorities.\r\nIn November, we announced a $400 million target for cost savings in 2015. We are more than on track to achieve this target. And this $400 million number relates to our underlying business, i.e. it excludes cost saved from business exits and disposals. Combined with the impact of such actions, we're on track for cost savings to headline costs exceeding $600 million in 2015.\r\nThe progress we've made in attacking the cost base underpins our confidence in achieving $1.8 billion in cost savings over the period 2015 to 2017. Where will the rest of the savings come from? Some, we'll derive from the full year impact of actions we've already taken, for example, the decision to exit equities, which will give us $100 million savings in 2016. Some will be the result of further peripheral business exits or withdrawals that we are currently pursuing, but most of the future savings will be from achieving sustainable efficiency improvements in our big markets and in our core business activities.\r\nWe're stepping up the pace of digitization, automating and reengineering key processes, standardizing technology platforms. For example, the only way we'll get the retail cost-income ratio down to our target of 55% is through accelerated digitization of products, of channels, of internal processes. And the only way we can manage the ever-increasing complexity of regulation efficiently is through technology. So we're not achieving cost savings by cutting back on investment. We're actually increasing investment in technology in order to achieve sustainable improvements in productivity.\r\nAsset quality. Andy has already spoken in some detail about asset quality. I just want to offer a more top-down perspective on where I think we are at. First, it should be no surprise that impairment increased in 2014. GDP growth in key markets has been slower. Commodity prices fell sharply. And we faced some specific challenges in particular markets, for example: PDRS in Korea, fraud in China. Of course, we could have fared better. With hindsight, there were clients and situations we should have avoided, but we were never going to be entirely immune to the shift in the credit environment.\r\nSecond, the actions we have taken to de-risk are having impact in India, in China, in our commodities book, in our unsecured portfolio in retail. Whilst there are still many uncertainties in our markets, I am very comfortable with our provisioning and with the shape and quality of the book.\r\nIn retail, whilst impairment remains at an elevated level, the indicators suggest some improvement, most notably in Korea. Looking at the early data for this year, PDRS filings are now less than half what they were 6 months ago. In Corporate and Institutional and commercial, the signals are more mixed, but most of what we are dealing with now and provisioning for are accounts that have been troubling for some time. The inflow of new problem accounts into early alerts, CG 12 or NPLs has slowed. Whilst it would certainly be premature and tempting fate to call it a peak, and there are areas we are monitoring and managing closely, we do not see signs of further deterioration.\r\nSo what about income? How much have we sacrificed to achieve our objectives on capital, costs and risk? Where is the growth going to come from? It is absolutely the case that we have deliberately given up income. The annualized income impact of exits and disposals from 2014 and planned for 2015 is some $450 million, although the 2015 impact depends on the timing of certain transactions. We will strip this out of our reporting of underlying performance for 2015. On top of this, de-risking and RWA saves in 2014 and the $25 billion to $30 billion of incremental RWA saves we plan for 2015, '16 will create a further drag on income, offset by our ability to redeploy into more attractively returning assets.\r\nSo the actions we're taking have had and will have a muting impact on income momentum, particularly in 2015, so where will the growth come from? The best way to answer this is to look at the individual client segments and talk about the underlying drivers of income and returns and about what we're trying to achieve, building on what we said in November.\r\nLet me start with retail clients. Here, the priority has been to get the cost down, shift the focus to more affluent clients and accelerate digitization as well as to de-risk from a conduct and credit perspective. It's all about getting the platform in more robust shape to support sustainable growth. Retail Clients income was up 2% year-on-year but up 5% half-on-half, driven by Wealth Management and the shift towards more affluent Priority and Business clients. These will continue to be the key driver of income growth. Indeed, we aim to increase the percentage of income from Priority and Business clients to 43% in 2015 from 38% last year.\r\nPrivate Banking. Private -- income growth in Private Banking was 4% headline, 6% excluding disposals. We see Private Banking as a steady and sustainable source of growth, although at this stage, it's obviously very small in the overall scheme of the bank. In 2015, we're looking at on-boarding some 2,000 new clients and to achieve double-digit AUM growth.\r\nCommercial Clients. This is also relatively small right now but represents another huge opportunity. After a year of restructuring and remediation, with income down 22%, our priority for 2015 is to get back to a growth trajectory, strengthening the frontline, leveraging the network, growing the client base. We're aiming to on-board around 3,000 new-to-bank clients in 2015.\r\nGiven that Corporate and Institutional segment represents about 60% of the group's income, this is the crux of the issue. Income fell 2% in 2014, impacted by a combination of de-risking and RWA actions, as well as pressure on margins and the impact of low commodity prices and low volatility. This overall picture disguises some areas of strong growth. For example, institutional investors, the institutional investor subsegment, saw 18% income growth at attractive returns in 2014, and this is a big opportunity. In Corporate, right now, it's all about improving return rather than income growth per se, and achieving this is all about leveraging the network and deepening relationships to drive non-funded income, hence our focus on the multimarket and multiproduct ratios that Andy talked about.\r\nIn 2015, we are looking to take the multiproduct ratio from the 2014 figure of 6.3 to over 6.5 and the multimarket ratio from the 2014 number of 2.8 to over 3. We are also focused on non-financing income, targeting to increase the current proportion from 41% to more than 43%. These metrics are the key to driving good income growth, growth that lifts our return on risk-weighted assets in this segment.\r\nStep back from the segments and look at our markets, and the scale of the income opportunity is evident. Despite all the turbulence and shifts in sentiment, the underlying drivers of economic growth, demographics, organization, investment in infrastructure, remain immensely strong. Demand for financial services is rising rapidly. Our challenge is to capture these opportunities in a disciplined, return-focused way to drive shareholder value.\r\nBefore I close, I want to talk briefly about our conduct agenda since this is right at the top of the management agenda.\r\nWe have launched a comprehensive program called Raising the Bar on Conduct, which encompasses every aspect of conduct, touches every person in the bank. We recognize that we can't claim to be Here for good, unless we make every effort to ensure that good conduct informs every interaction and is embedded in every decision we make, from strategy, client on-boarding, product design, to remuneration.\r\nAmongst the more critical elements of this program, I would highlight the Financial Crime Risk Mitigation Program, which encompasses over 50 separate projects and initiatives to remediate and reinforce our controls and capabilities in this vital arena. This is a massive, multiyear investment program. Playing a stronger role in the fight against financial crime is a strategic imperative for Standard Chartered.\r\nTo complement stronger controls, we're also de-risking our client portfolios. For example, we have exited a significant number of correspondent banking relationships, mainly in Latin America and Central Europe. We have also exited around 70,000 SME relationships over the last 18 months. And we're putting strict limits on the types of new client we're prepared to take on in certain geographies and sectors. To reinforce our governance of these efforts, we've established a board-level Financial Crime Risk Committee with a combination of experienced NEDs, non-executive directors; and expert advisers.\r\nThe actions we're -- we've taken and are taking on capital, costs, risks and conduct are all part of a package. We are reshaping the bank to respond to the way our world has changed. We are reshaping the bank to ensure we can fulfill our aspiration to bank the people and companies driving trade, investment and the creation of wealth across Asia, Africa and the Middle East. And we're reshaping the bank to get back to sustainable and profitable growth, delivering returns above our cost of capital.\r\nThis will be the last occasion on which I present a set of results to you, and it's obviously one of the more challenging sets of numbers I have had to explain. In my 13 years at the bank, I have seen lots of ups and downs. Standard Chartered today is very different from the bank I first joined as Finance Director in 2002. That year, we made about $1 billion in profits. And in 2006, when I became CEO, we made about $3 billion. Since then, of course, we've navigated the global financial crisis, roughly doubled in size and confronted all sorts of new challenges. The world of banking has changed far more dramatically than most people realize, and in my view, it's only partway through a fundamental transformation.\r\nI will leave Standard Chartered proud of what we have achieved and confident about what the future holds for this extraordinary institution. In Bill Winters, I have a successor just right for the task. I am delighted to be passing the baton on to a banker of such caliber, to a leader of such strength. Bill will inherit a bank with a superb client franchise, a unique network and an exceptionally strong balance sheet. Perhaps even more importantly, he will inherit a fantastic team of people: professional, collaborative, truly believing, truly committed to being Here for good.\r\nI'd like to end by saying my final thank you to our clients, my final thank you to our shareholders and my final thank you to all the people of Standard Chartered. These last couple of years has been pretty tough, but we have demonstrated resilience and an ability to adapt and reinvent. I know that Standard Chartered will once again show the world what a great bank this is.\r\nThank you.\r\nJohn, Andy, Mike and I will now take questions in London. Jaspal, Ben, May and Julian will take your questions in Hong Kong. Thank you very much.\r\nIt's the usual procedure, if you can -- if I'll point you at and then we'll wait for a mic, and then if you can say your name and your institution. So why don't we start on the right-hand side at the front?",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: John Peace (Executives)】\nGood morning, London, and good afternoon, Hong Kong.\r\n2014 was a challenging year, and our performance was disappointing, but it was also a year when we took decisive action to refocus our strategy and to reposition the group for the future. As a board, we continue to believe that there are significant opportunities for the group, in the medium- to long-term, across our footprint, and that is why we've been careful not to take any knee-jerk reactions which may damage the long-term prospects of the business. However, at the same time, we need to be mindful that there are significant factors impacting our current performance which cannot be ignored: the imperative to build capital across the industry, the need for ongoing investment in enhancing our systems and processes associated with conduct and compliance; and the need to change the shape of our business to fit the demands of the current economic and regulatory landscape. As a consequence of this, the board has recently endorsed a number of priority areas.\r\nThe first of these, we embarked on last week by providing clarity on our governance, our leadership and succession plans. And today, we are going further by highlighting a number of other priorities. These are taking steps to build on our capital levels, enhancing our return on equity and continuing to improve our conduct and compliance capabilities. Andy and Peter will go into some detail on each of these priorities shortly, but let me again stress the board's determination to reshape the business, to restore the group's performance and to fully realize the opportunities in our markets.\r\nAt the same time, we are determined to continue to raise the bar on conduct and compliance to ensure that the Here for good, our brand promise, is firmly embedded in the DNA of the bank worldwide. And whilst we're comfortable with our current capital position, the board does want to improve our capital trajectory going forward. And so today, you will hear a lot about the actions we're taking around risk-weighted assets, reducing costs and business disposals, all of which are aimed at strengthening both our Common Equity Tier 1 levels and our trajectory going forward. \r\nWe believe we've identified strong levers to manage capital accretion over time. And therefore, the board is recommending a final dividend for 2014 of $0.572, resulting in a total annual dividend of $0.86, which is the same level of dividends per share as last year.\r\nLet me now comment on how we remunerate our people, most of whom are not located here in the U.K. As this chart shows, for several years, we have significantly increased the amount paid out to shareholders by way of dividend whilst at the same time consecutively reducing the amount paid out in bonuses despite increasing staff numbers over this period. And in 2014, we are again proposing to pay out more to our shareholders by way of dividends than we pay out in bonuses. This disciplined approach to managing variable compensation has created significant competitive pressures in some of our key markets. We are, of course, mindful of the external sentiment in some markets on bankers' pay and conscious of our disappointing performance in 2014, but it is essential that we remain able to pay competitively in the markets we operate in and where wage inflation on average is around 5%. Our people are much sought after by our competition, and we're acutely conscious of the importance of retaining and attracting the best talent as we look to execute on our strategy. It also goes without saying that, consistent with past practice, we will only reward our people for good performance as well as for their good behaviors.\r\nNow taking all these factors into account and reflecting our performance in 2014, the bonus pool is down on last year by 9% and is 27% lower than in 2011. In light of the disappointing performance of the group, those executive directors on the PLC board throughout the year came to the conclusion that they should show leadership by not taking a bonus for 2014.\r\nSo to conclude, a brief comment on last week's announcement detailing our comprehensive package of board and leadership changes.\r\nI'd like to take this opportunity to thank Peter, on behalf of the board, for the immense contribution he has made to the success of the group over the past 13 years both as Chief Executive -- as Group Chief Executive and as Group Finance Director. Since becoming Group Chief Executive in 2006, the group has more than doubled in size and has been consistently profitable. His leadership and insight over a period of huge change and challenge for the entire industry ensures that he leaves the group well placed to achieve its full potential as one of the world's leading financial institution.\r\nI would also like to thank Jaspal for his very considerable contributions to the business over the past 16 years and to thank other long-serving board members who are stepping down this year and who have done so much to help position this great bank for the future. A very big thank you to each and every one of you.\r\nNow we're extremely fortunate to have Bill Winters, one of the most accomplished and respected bankers in the world today, taking over as Chief Executive from Peter in June, to drive the bank's next chapter of growth. Bill brings substantial financial experience from leading a very successful global business and has an exceptional understanding of the global regulatory and conduct environment. He's also a proven leader with a strong track record in nurturing and developing talent. I'm personally thrilled that Bill is joining our bank at this strategically important time, and I'm sure we all wish him well in his new role.\r\nOn that note, let me hand over to Andy, who will tell you more about the 2014 results and share with you some of his own observations and thoughts on group performance since he joined Standard Chartered just last year.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Andrew Halford (Executives)】\nThank you, John. And good morning or afternoon to everybody. Before I go into the detail of numbers for 2014, I want to share with you a few perspectives 9 months after joining the bank back in the summer of last year. One thing it has certainly not been, in line with Peter's original promise, has been dull. During that time, I've traveled extensively to some of our biggest markets, Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea and India; some of our smaller markets, Kenya and Tanzania; as well as our major network hubs in New York and London. I have met with several hundred of our senior people, as well as addressing town hall meetings in multiple locations. The universal takeaways have been that our people are immensely proud of working for the bank, but, depending in part on geography, they are feeling bruised by both the recent trading performance and the external commentary. They are determined to learn from the past year but then put it behind them and move forwards.\r\nIn many senses, arriving in the summer of last year was excellent timing, coinciding as it did with the newly established client and product groups commencing their individual strategies, which were subsequently articulated at our Investor Meeting in Hong Kong in November. Pulling together a 300-slide presentation on the bank's strategy had not been something on my original first-100-day checklist. Since then, I have been heavily involved with Peter, Mike and the executive team in turning those plans into clear operational and financial targets for each part of the business for the next 3 years, all of which culminated in the rollout of group-wide scorecards by the third week in January, something that Peter will refer to later.\r\nDuring that time, I've also met with many of you and clearly, very clearly, heard your concerns about business momentum, quality of the credit book, costs, U.S. regulation and capital adequacy; as well as requests for a more realistic tone in our external market communications. To the latter point, we have, I believe, made the quality of information in our IMS much more insightful; terminated the somewhat ambiguous preclose statements; and at the November Investor Meeting, provided clearer insights into our business, especially relating to returns and the quality of the loan book. In today's press release, we have refreshed many of the disclosures, which hopefully make the risks section, in particular, more informative.\r\nUnsurprisingly, I have spent a considerable amount of time over the last few months with Richard Goulding and the team in risk, really getting to understand exactly how our overall operational risk processes work, how proactive we are in dealing with cyclical or sectoral changes and how we go about provisioning. What has been very clear to me is that our loan portfolio is extremely diverse and quite difficult to meaningfully draw conclusions from based upon high-level external assumptions. In the vast majority of instances, our exposures are to a client, not to a specific product, and hence the assessment on recoverability is much more about the robustness of that client's business model to a downturn, not to depressed prices per se. This involves a detailed upfront assessment by our teams on a client-by-client basis, not something easily capable of extrapolation from external data.\r\nAs well as individual assessments, the group also undertakes extreme stress-testing exercises to scan for vulnerabilities. Many of the areas currently experiencing heightened stress levels were flagged as concerns several years ago and have been actively managed since. This clearly doesn't mean we will avoid impairment. And indeed this year, the year-end review has resulted in a number of provisions being taken, particularly in the commodities sector, to ensure that, as best we can see based upon currently available information, we are appropriately provisioned.\r\nI've also gone through these extensively with the new head of our group special asset management team; as well as our external auditors, KPMG. The majority of the issues relate to advances made several years ago, and very few relate to recent credit decisions. We've also taken a number of assertive actions around other impairment for the year. We have written off the remaining Korea goodwill, have topped-up a number of commodity exposure impairments, have written-down a number of strategic and associated investments, as well as booking a goodwill charge on the exit of the institutional cash equities business.\r\nOne of the things that has given me comfort as I have looked through the loan book is the group's observed recovery range -- rates, which are very supportive of the net exposures after provisioning and after collateral. I was also of the view very early on that we could do more on costs. And hence, we preannounced the $400 million top-dollar target for 2015, which is now well on track. With, in retail alone, around 2,000 jobs having been cut or announced and completed in the last 3 months of 2014, and a further 2,000 expected during 2015. We are now turning our attention to identifying cost opportunities for 2016 and beyond and have, as you will have seen, announced a 3-year target to take $1.8 billion of costs out the business, comprising underlying savings of between $400 million and $500 million per annum and the impact of any divestments.\r\nBefore I turn to the slides themselves, one final comment. It was clear to me that our financial framework was no longer suitable for the phase we are in, in particular the continuing regulatory imperative for the sector overall, ourselves included, by building more capital headroom and the need to upgrade the robustness of our conduct and financial crime capabilities. We have, therefore, decided to target 2 overarching objectives going forwards: firstly, to get our CET1 ratio between 11% and 12% in 2015 and thereafter; and secondly, to get our return on equity above 10% in the medium term. Unfortunately, several of the actions that solve for the former put more stress on the latter and vice versa, hence why we have sequenced the priorities in this way. Indeed, a simple way of showing underlying return on equity of the group will be to separate out the parts that are clearly dragging the overall performance. Korea and the bank levy alone would take our return on equity nearly into double digits. However, life is clearly not that simple, and Peter will discuss in more detail the 2 primary actions regarding RWA and costs that we will focus on to deliver on these priorities in a moment.\r\nSo on to the slides. The numbers, as you know, are disappointing with a 2% reduction in income and a 30% reduction in statutory profit before tax, in part driven by higher impairment charges. I will go through several of the numbers on this slide separately, so let me just comment on 1 or 2 of the items that are more lumpy in nature and less reflective of the underlying performance of the franchise.\r\nWe have incurred restructuring costs of $181 million in the year, approximately 1/4 related to redundancy programs in Korea, with the balance reflecting the realignment of the client segments and products groups under the new organization structure, including a number of business exits. Our business -- our bank levy has risen a significant 56% to $366 million. In August, as you know, we reached a settlement with the U.S. authorities of $300 million. And more recently, we carried out a detailed review of the outlook for our Korean business. Whilst we are encouraged by the recent PDRS trends and hence the opportunity to improve upon the business' recent disappointing financial performance, it is nonetheless currently lossmaking. And hence, we are writing off the remaining goodwill of $726 million, on top of the $1 billion write-down last year. This write-off has no cash effect to the group, nor does it affect the capital ratios, as goodwill is already fully deducted for prudential purposes. The main normalizing items are therefore the Korean impairment, U.S. settlement and own credit adjustment. On this basis, adjusted profit before tax for the year was $5.2 billion, down 25%.\r\nSo moving on to the next slide. Normalized earnings per share were, as a consequence, down by 28% to $1.46. And the normalized return on equity was 7.8%.\r\nThe balance sheet remains in good shape. Our Basel III transitional CET1 ratio of 10.5% is flat in the second half despite absorbing 30 basis points of headwinds, including model changes and the further foreseeable dividend, as well as having taken greater provisions on commodities exposures, as I referred to. As I mentioned earlier, 2014 returns are clearly not what we aspire to, and key to those will be improving and executing on the client segment strategies. Peter is going to update you on these in a moment, but before that, let's look at our performance in a little bit more detail, starting with income by segment.\r\nAs you can see from this slide, notwithstanding decisions to de-risk our portfolio in areas such as retail unsecured and commodity financing, we restricted the reduction in the top line to 2%. The biggest reduction in our year-on-year income performance was in the Commercial Clients segment, where income fell by $322 million. This was driven by current-year private equity valuation reductions relative to realized gains in the previous year, weaker demand for renminbi products in financial markets as well as exiting a significant number of relationships whose risk-and-return equation no longer met our requirements.\r\nIncome from Corporate and Institutional Clients was down 2% or $225 million. Continued weakness in financial markets and management actions taken to optimize returns on the balance sheet offset gains on the exit of a number of private equity investments. The business has shown early progress on the metrics we set out in November last year, with an improvement in the multimarket ratio from 2.6 to 2.8 and the multiproduct ratio increasing from 5.9 to 6.3. Risk-weighted assets increased by 10%, primarily due to the impact of Basel III and policy, methodology and model changes. Excluding this impact, risk-weighted assets were flat.\r\nIncome from Private Banking clients was up 4%, driven by strong performance in Greater China. It is worth noting that we have exited a number of subscale businesses in the period, and excluding the impacts of these discontinued operations, income from Private Banking clients was up 6%, driven by net new money inflows of $6 billion. The business has also increased the number of relationship managers during the year and added 1,300 new clients, including early successes from the internal client referral program.\r\nRetail client income of just over $6 billion was up 2% on the year. Strong growth in income from the Priority segment, up 16%, offset a decline in the personal segment, which was down 5%. This is consistent with our strategy to focus on more affluent segments and de-risk our unsecured portfolios, particularly in Korea. We continued to reshape our business in Korea and, during the year, have exited 60 branches and almost 300 staff. Excluding Korea, retail client income was up 4%.\r\nSo turning now and looking at income by product.\r\nTransaction Banking income of $3.8 billion was down 3% year-on-year. Trade finance, which accounts for just over half of this income, was down 5%. Margins have remained broadly stable, though average assets were down 4% in the second half, reflecting a slower trade environment and continued assertive management of low-returning risk-weighted assets. Cash Management and Custody, which accounts for the remaining half of the income, was flat year-on-year. Margins were driven lower by the significant liquidity that persists across our key markets, but this is offset by good growth in average balances and record clearing levels as we continue to win multicountry Transaction Banking mandates.\r\nIncome from Financial Markets was down $456 million year-on-year. In foreign exchange, strong volume growth in cash FX, up 47%, and FX options, up 89%, has been offset by ongoing spread compression. In Rates, low volatility and low interest rates continue to impact both volumes and spreads.\r\nCorporate Finance income was down 1% year-on-year, as high levels of liquidity resulted in slightly increased repayment levels. Wealth Management income was up 17% and is benefiting in particular from the Prudential Bancassurance partnership as well as an accelerating shift towards servicing high-net-worth individuals in the retail client segment, as I mentioned earlier.\r\nIncome from Retail Products was down 4% or $206 million year-on-year, impacted predominantly by our continued de-risking of the unsecured portfolio. Within this, income from cards, personal loans and unsecured lending was down 8% or $212 million year-on-year following a 14% reduction in balances to $20.5 billion. Income from mortgages was down $59 million or 6% as property market cooling measures muted volume growth in a number of markets.\r\nThe other category, on the slide, includes income from assets and liability management, lending and portfolio management and Principal Finance. Asset and liability management income was up 19% to $653 million and benefited from the more efficient deployment of surplus renminbi customer deposits, the majority of which was recorded in the first half. Second half income of $233 million is more reflective of the underlying performance. \r\nLending and portfolio management income fell 4%, reflecting lower balances as we exited some lower-returning relationships. And finally, Principal Finance income was up 17% year-on-year. The gains on the exit of a number of private equity investments, at positive multiples, more than offset lower revaluations.\r\nSo moving to expenses.\r\nAs you can see from this slide, underlying costs of $10.2 billion increased by less than 3%. During the year, we have faced further regulatory cost increases of $237 million, which -- without which our overall underlying costs would have been flat. To offset these increases, as well as inflation of nearly $400 million, the group has delivered cost efficiencies in 2014 of some $200 million, of which we are now doubling to over $400 million as our target for 2015. We are now working, as I said earlier, on the pipeline of further sustainable productivity improvements for 2016 and 2017. Taken as a whole, these represent a significant program of initiatives that will deliver sustainable cost savings of some $1.8 billion in total over the next 3 years. Peter will pick this up later.\r\nTurning to impairment. Loan impairment is up $524 million or 32% to $2.1 billion for the full year. Approximately 40% of this arises in the retail client segment, which is 3% lower than the previous year, benefiting primarily from improved PRS -- PDRS in Korea. The remaining $1.2 billion loan impairment arises in the Corporate and Institutional and Commercial Clients segments, where since we spoke to you last, further weakness in commodity markets has impacted a small number of exposures that we have been closely monitoring for some time.\r\nOther impairment, excluding goodwill, was $403 million. The main increase in the year included the impairment on the China warehouse fraud mentioned in the half year results and impairments of certain strategic and associate investments.\r\nGiven the further deterioration in commodity markets this year, I want to cover our commodity portfolio in a little more detail.\r\nOur total commodity exposure is now $55 billion or 10% of the group's overall total net exposure. The vast majority of our commodities exposures is trade related, evidenced by the short tenure of the book, with 74% being less than 1 year. This allows us to act quickly to changes in the external environment. In fact, our commodities exposure is down $6 billion in the second half of the year alone, as we actively managed the portfolio.\r\nWhen thinking about vulnerability to a sustained bear market, there are some important factors to consider. 60% of our exposure is to global majors; large state-owned enterprises; or are investment grade, which we expect to prove highly resilient even through a sustained downturn. A further 32% is short-term or trade-finance related at less than 1 year in tenure, again, highly resilient. 4% is to fund structured Project or Corporate Finance with very high levels of collateral. This leaves just 4% of the portfolio potentially more vulnerable to prolonged weakness in commodity prices.\r\nSo what actions have we taken to manage the risks here? We have conducted an in-depth review of our Traders portfolio. And as a result, we have exited 150 relationships since early 2013, have reduced exposures since the half year by $2 billion or 6% and have focused upon commodity traders with sound internal risk management capabilities and good access to other liquidity sources. 2 years ago, we identified which clients in our Producers portfolio might be potentially vulnerable to a sharp correction in commodity prices. We have actively managed those names, since reducing exposure, taking additional collateral and exiting relationships where necessary. Whilst we have seen nonperforming loan formation, reflecting the extremely low level of some commodity prices, refreshed stress tests have identified no new names to add to this list.\r\nTurning to oil specifically, which represents around half of our commodity exposure. 98% of our oil producer exposure is either to state-owned enterprises or to \"low cost of extraction\" companies who have a breakeven price below the current market price. The real situation may be somewhat better than this, in fact, as we have conservatively allowed no slowdown in these companies' capital expenditure, no refinancing, no depletion of cash balances for a period of 1 year. We simply do not have exposures to \"high cost of extraction\" parts of the industry.\r\nThe final point of context for our portfolio is that many of our markets actively benefit from lower commodity prices. Even oil-producing markets like Ghana are net importers of oil, and markets like India are receiving a real boost from lower prices.\r\nIn conclusion, we have conducted a very thorough review of our commodities exposure, and the main areas of potential vulnerability lie in a very small proportion of our portfolio, which we have been very actively managing.\r\nSo what about the overall credit quality of the book? As I have looked across the group over the past 9 months, there are a number of observations that I want to make and share with you that give me comfort in the credit quality overall.\r\nFirstly, the book is becoming increasingly diverse. No single industry now accounts for more than 16% of corporate loans and advances, and our top 20 exposures have reduced as a proportion of our CET1. The book remains predominantly short dated, with nearly 2/3 of Corporate and Institutional and Commercial Clients exposures being less than 1 year. We are holding increased levels of collateral, up 4%, with high levels of collateralization for longer-term and noninvestment-grade loans.\r\nOver 40% of the corporate portfolio is investment grade, and this mix is increasing. Whilst early alerts are not always the most accurate predictor of subsequent impairment, it is nonetheless encouraging that recent early alert trends have been stable. Delinquency rates in our retail book have started to improve following continued de-risking of the unsecured book and an improved PDRS trend in Korea.\r\nCG accounts are stable compared to the half year. In fact, they're down compared to the half year. And whilst nonperforming loans are up slightly, 4%, in the first half, the increase does relate to a number of accounts we have been actively managing for some time. And finally, market risk is predominantly client driven and remains very low in absolute terms.\r\nSo in summary, the current elevated level of loan impairment reflects increases arising from India and China as well as our commodity exposures in these and some other markets, including Indonesia and Africa. We flagged these areas of risk early and have been proactively managing them for some time.\r\nSo to change topic and move on to the balance sheet.\r\nThe balance sheet is in good shape. Very diversified, well structured and highly liquid, with deposits up $29 billion or 6% in the second half alone. We already more than meet the minimum Basel III requirements for both the net stable funding ratio and the liquidity coverage ratio.\r\nLoans and advances to customers are down $16 billion or 5% in the second half, driven by continued de-risking of the retail unsecured portfolio; reducing exposure to the energy, mining and quarrying sectors; more assertive management of low-returning relationships; high levels of liquidity resulting in early repayments; and currency translation. Actually, on a constant currency basis, loans and advances to customers are flat year-on-year. As a result, our advance-to-deposit ratio is now below 70% and our liquid asset ratio is 32.2%.\r\nIn summary, we finished the year with our balance sheet in good shape.\r\nTurning to capital. Our transitional CET1 ratio of 10.5% is flat in the second half. This is after absorbing a combined 30-basis-point deduction for model, methodology and policy changes; the foreseeable dividend; and the settlement with U.K. -- U.S. authorities; as well as the impact of the increased U.K. bank levy. This is a clear demonstration of the group's strong underlying equity generation of some 50 basis points in the year, above our historic trend of 30 basis points. Furthermore, our endpoint CET1 ratio of 10.7% is 200 basis points above our known minimum requirement, with capacity therefore to absorb future add-ons such as the countercyclical buffer, as it is phased-in.\r\nFurthermore, we have maintained a strong level of total loss-absorbing capacity or TLAC, above 20%. And our leverage ratio at 4.5% is significantly ahead of our 2019 requirement. We currently plan to issue AT1 capital this year, as we look to manage total capital efficiently and build our AT1 levels over time to the amount permitted by applicable regulations.\r\nClearly, we are in an environment where we need to manage capital requirements dynamically over time, balancing it with delivering returns to shareholders. So where are our priorities going forwards? Simply put, our financial priorities are to accrete capital to a CET1 ratio of between 11% and 12% in 2015 and thereafter and to deliver return on equity of over 10% in the medium-term. These priorities replace the flexed financial framework set out in November 2013.\r\nThe regulatory environment continues to evolve, typically requiring the industry to hold increasing levels of capital. Against this backdrop, the group will prioritize actions that organically enhance the CET1 ratio whilst acknowledging there will be an impact on the return on equity. Based on our current best view of the regulatory outlook, we are very confident in our ability to reach a CET1 capital ratio of between 11% and 12% in 2015 and thereafter.\r\nBuilding the group's return on equity to an attractive level, sustainably above the cost of equity, is key to delivering long-term value to shareholders and remains our focus.\r\nSo to summarize.\r\nThe board took action to clarify leadership and succession last week. And today, we are setting out the actions around our commitments on capital, returns and also around conduct and compliance. 2015 will be about accelerating management action and executing the plans we set out in November for the 4 client segments.\r\nWe are prioritizing organic capital accretion and through a series of planned asset disposals and business exits as well as continued management of low-returning relationships, we expect to release $25 million to $30 billion in RWA over the next 2 years. To protect returns, we are targeting $1.8 billion of sustainable cost savings over the next 3 years. And we continue to raise the bar on conduct and compliance. We have a number of material initiatives underway, which Peter will go through in more detail.\r\nCombined, these represent a significant program of initiatives that will create a platform from which we can build the returns to an attractive level. Peter will talk you through each of these forward commitments in a little bit more detail now.\r\nSo close to. Whilst 2014 was a very difficult year, the staff around the bank and the management are absolutely determined to restore the group's performance levels.\r\nThank you, and I'll now hand back to Peter.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nThank you, Andy. And good morning to those of you in London, and good afternoon to those in Hong Kong.\r\nAndy has covered our 2014 numbers, and I am not going to repeat what he said. It was a tough year. Our performance was disappointing, and we are acutely aware of the impact of this for you, our shareholders. We faced a perfect storm: a negative sentiment towards emerging markets, a sharp drop in commodity prices, persistent low interest rates and surplus liquidity, low volatility and a welter of regulatory challenges. As a result, we saw intense pressure on margins and volumes, a significant uptick in impairment and a sharp increase in regulatory-related costs.\r\nAnd of course, it wasn't all about external factors. Some of the decisions we took in the past look less good now than they did at the time, Korea, for example, which in 2014 made a loss, before tax, of $145 million. Not everything we did was as well executed as it should have been. For example, the upgrade of our transaction surveillance systems back in 2007, shortcomings here ultimately resulted in the civil penalty of $300 million we paid last August.\r\nWe've taken a range of actions in response to the way our world has changed, some tactical, some more fundamental. I know some of you think we should have acted faster or more dramatically. Perhaps that's right. Perhaps we haven't explained properly what we've done. The fact is that, in 2014, we did more to change the way the bank is run than in any year since when I first arrived. We've overhauled the strategy, making it sharper and more focused. We've reconfigured the organization to get better alignment behind our strategic priorities. We've attacked the cost base. We've redeployed capital. We've disposed of or are in the process of disposing 15 underperforming and nonstrategic business. We've de-risked portfolios and segments such as unsecured or correspondent banking. We've stepped up the pace of our program to raise the bar on conduct.\r\nAnd while some of these changes actually made 2014 performance worse since we sacrificed income or increased investment, I'm confident that the way we are reshaping the bank will get us back to a trajectory of profitable, sustainable growth, delivering returns above our cost of capital and thus driving the share price.\r\nI should make clear that we are not counting on the world to do us favors, so while we do expect a gradual return to a more normal interest rate environment, and this year, we've already seen more volatility in currency markets, we're not counting on headwinds turning to tailwinds to boost our performance. We are focused on the levers that we control, the things that we can do to improve returns, increase productivity and return to growth.\r\nOur performance priorities are clear. First, we must dispel concerns about capital, hence the clear target of an 11% to 12% CET1 ratio in 2015 and thereafter. Second, we must improve returns. Hence, we are setting a target ROE of over 10% in the medium term so that we are sustainably delivering above our cost of capital. This will take a bit of time to achieve, not least because, as Andy said, the actions we're taking to strengthen the CET1 ratio make this more difficult.\r\nSo what do we have to do to make this happen? I'll answer that by addressing the obvious big areas of shareholder concern, capital, costs, credit quality and income growth; expanding a bit on what we've done already; and more importantly, telling you what we are doing now. I'll also talk about conduct since this, too, is vitally important to the future success of the bank. As I do this, I want to make clear that each element fits into an overall agenda of action and that all of these initiatives are already captured in the scorecards of the individual clients and product groups, functions and geographies across the bank.\r\nOn capital, we start from a strong position. In terms of our CET1 ratio, at 10.7% on an end-state basis, we have a 200-basis-point buffer relative to known regulatory requirements. We weathered the Bank of England's stress tests comfortably. We're strongly placed from a leverage and TLAC perspective.\r\nHowever, we understand market concerns about forward trajectory given the uncertainties about how regulatory requirements will evolve. Although it is impossible to be definitive, a combination of RWA inflation and escalating expectations do point to a continuing upward drift in regulatory requirements. That's why we put such a focus on capital accretion so that we can absorb regulatory changes and fund growth whilst also improving the ratio. We accreted some 50 basis points in 2014, 20 basis points in the first half, 30 in the second half. To achieve this, we cut some $9 billion of low-returning RWA, largely from Corporate and Institutional Clients, and saved another $2 billion from disposals.\r\nWe now plan to pull these levers even harder. Over the next 2 years, we plan to cut a further $25 billion to $30 billion of RWA from low-returning client relationships and underperforming businesses. We are making good progress on this already, and by taking these actions, we are confident that we can achieve our target CET1 ratio of 11% to 12% in 2015 and thereafter.\r\nCosts. In 2014, we kept a tight grip on costs. Whilst headline expenses went up 5%, over half of this increase was due to the U.K. bank levy and restructuring costs attached to the very cost actions we are taking. Underlying expenses went up less than 3%, driven largely by increased spend on regulatory and conduct priorities.\r\nIn November, we announced a $400 million target for cost savings in 2015. We are more than on track to achieve this target. And this $400 million number relates to our underlying business, i.e. it excludes cost saved from business exits and disposals. Combined with the impact of such actions, we're on track for cost savings to headline costs exceeding $600 million in 2015.\r\nThe progress we've made in attacking the cost base underpins our confidence in achieving $1.8 billion in cost savings over the period 2015 to 2017. Where will the rest of the savings come from? Some, we'll derive from the full year impact of actions we've already taken, for example, the decision to exit equities, which will give us $100 million savings in 2016. Some will be the result of further peripheral business exits or withdrawals that we are currently pursuing, but most of the future savings will be from achieving sustainable efficiency improvements in our big markets and in our core business activities.\r\nWe're stepping up the pace of digitization, automating and reengineering key processes, standardizing technology platforms. For example, the only way we'll get the retail cost-income ratio down to our target of 55% is through accelerated digitization of products, of channels, of internal processes. And the only way we can manage the ever-increasing complexity of regulation efficiently is through technology. So we're not achieving cost savings by cutting back on investment. We're actually increasing investment in technology in order to achieve sustainable improvements in productivity.\r\nAsset quality. Andy has already spoken in some detail about asset quality. I just want to offer a more top-down perspective on where I think we are at. First, it should be no surprise that impairment increased in 2014. GDP growth in key markets has been slower. Commodity prices fell sharply. And we faced some specific challenges in particular markets, for example: PDRS in Korea, fraud in China. Of course, we could have fared better. With hindsight, there were clients and situations we should have avoided, but we were never going to be entirely immune to the shift in the credit environment.\r\nSecond, the actions we have taken to de-risk are having impact in India, in China, in our commodities book, in our unsecured portfolio in retail. Whilst there are still many uncertainties in our markets, I am very comfortable with our provisioning and with the shape and quality of the book.\r\nIn retail, whilst impairment remains at an elevated level, the indicators suggest some improvement, most notably in Korea. Looking at the early data for this year, PDRS filings are now less than half what they were 6 months ago. In Corporate and Institutional and commercial, the signals are more mixed, but most of what we are dealing with now and provisioning for are accounts that have been troubling for some time. The inflow of new problem accounts into early alerts, CG 12 or NPLs has slowed. Whilst it would certainly be premature and tempting fate to call it a peak, and there are areas we are monitoring and managing closely, we do not see signs of further deterioration.\r\nSo what about income? How much have we sacrificed to achieve our objectives on capital, costs and risk? Where is the growth going to come from? It is absolutely the case that we have deliberately given up income. The annualized income impact of exits and disposals from 2014 and planned for 2015 is some $450 million, although the 2015 impact depends on the timing of certain transactions. We will strip this out of our reporting of underlying performance for 2015. On top of this, de-risking and RWA saves in 2014 and the $25 billion to $30 billion of incremental RWA saves we plan for 2015, '16 will create a further drag on income, offset by our ability to redeploy into more attractively returning assets.\r\nSo the actions we're taking have had and will have a muting impact on income momentum, particularly in 2015, so where will the growth come from? The best way to answer this is to look at the individual client segments and talk about the underlying drivers of income and returns and about what we're trying to achieve, building on what we said in November.\r\nLet me start with retail clients. Here, the priority has been to get the cost down, shift the focus to more affluent clients and accelerate digitization as well as to de-risk from a conduct and credit perspective. It's all about getting the platform in more robust shape to support sustainable growth. Retail Clients income was up 2% year-on-year but up 5% half-on-half, driven by Wealth Management and the shift towards more affluent Priority and Business clients. These will continue to be the key driver of income growth. Indeed, we aim to increase the percentage of income from Priority and Business clients to 43% in 2015 from 38% last year.\r\nPrivate Banking. Private -- income growth in Private Banking was 4% headline, 6% excluding disposals. We see Private Banking as a steady and sustainable source of growth, although at this stage, it's obviously very small in the overall scheme of the bank. In 2015, we're looking at on-boarding some 2,000 new clients and to achieve double-digit AUM growth.\r\nCommercial Clients. This is also relatively small right now but represents another huge opportunity. After a year of restructuring and remediation, with income down 22%, our priority for 2015 is to get back to a growth trajectory, strengthening the frontline, leveraging the network, growing the client base. We're aiming to on-board around 3,000 new-to-bank clients in 2015.\r\nGiven that Corporate and Institutional segment represents about 60% of the group's income, this is the crux of the issue. Income fell 2% in 2014, impacted by a combination of de-risking and RWA actions, as well as pressure on margins and the impact of low commodity prices and low volatility. This overall picture disguises some areas of strong growth. For example, institutional investors, the institutional investor subsegment, saw 18% income growth at attractive returns in 2014, and this is a big opportunity. In Corporate, right now, it's all about improving return rather than income growth per se, and achieving this is all about leveraging the network and deepening relationships to drive non-funded income, hence our focus on the multimarket and multiproduct ratios that Andy talked about.\r\nIn 2015, we are looking to take the multiproduct ratio from the 2014 figure of 6.3 to over 6.5 and the multimarket ratio from the 2014 number of 2.8 to over 3. We are also focused on non-financing income, targeting to increase the current proportion from 41% to more than 43%. These metrics are the key to driving good income growth, growth that lifts our return on risk-weighted assets in this segment.\r\nStep back from the segments and look at our markets, and the scale of the income opportunity is evident. Despite all the turbulence and shifts in sentiment, the underlying drivers of economic growth, demographics, organization, investment in infrastructure, remain immensely strong. Demand for financial services is rising rapidly. Our challenge is to capture these opportunities in a disciplined, return-focused way to drive shareholder value.\r\nBefore I close, I want to talk briefly about our conduct agenda since this is right at the top of the management agenda.\r\nWe have launched a comprehensive program called Raising the Bar on Conduct, which encompasses every aspect of conduct, touches every person in the bank. We recognize that we can't claim to be Here for good, unless we make every effort to ensure that good conduct informs every interaction and is embedded in every decision we make, from strategy, client on-boarding, product design, to remuneration.\r\nAmongst the more critical elements of this program, I would highlight the Financial Crime Risk Mitigation Program, which encompasses over 50 separate projects and initiatives to remediate and reinforce our controls and capabilities in this vital arena. This is a massive, multiyear investment program. Playing a stronger role in the fight against financial crime is a strategic imperative for Standard Chartered.\r\nTo complement stronger controls, we're also de-risking our client portfolios. For example, we have exited a significant number of correspondent banking relationships, mainly in Latin America and Central Europe. We have also exited around 70,000 SME relationships over the last 18 months. And we're putting strict limits on the types of new client we're prepared to take on in certain geographies and sectors. To reinforce our governance of these efforts, we've established a board-level Financial Crime Risk Committee with a combination of experienced NEDs, non-executive directors; and expert advisers.\r\nThe actions we're -- we've taken and are taking on capital, costs, risks and conduct are all part of a package. We are reshaping the bank to respond to the way our world has changed. We are reshaping the bank to ensure we can fulfill our aspiration to bank the people and companies driving trade, investment and the creation of wealth across Asia, Africa and the Middle East. And we're reshaping the bank to get back to sustainable and profitable growth, delivering returns above our cost of capital.\r\nThis will be the last occasion on which I present a set of results to you, and it's obviously one of the more challenging sets of numbers I have had to explain. In my 13 years at the bank, I have seen lots of ups and downs. Standard Chartered today is very different from the bank I first joined as Finance Director in 2002. That year, we made about $1 billion in profits. And in 2006, when I became CEO, we made about $3 billion. Since then, of course, we've navigated the global financial crisis, roughly doubled in size and confronted all sorts of new challenges. The world of banking has changed far more dramatically than most people realize, and in my view, it's only partway through a fundamental transformation.\r\nI will leave Standard Chartered proud of what we have achieved and confident about what the future holds for this extraordinary institution. In Bill Winters, I have a successor just right for the task. I am delighted to be passing the baton on to a banker of such caliber, to a leader of such strength. Bill will inherit a bank with a superb client franchise, a unique network and an exceptionally strong balance sheet. Perhaps even more importantly, he will inherit a fantastic team of people: professional, collaborative, truly believing, truly committed to being Here for good.\r\nI'd like to end by saying my final thank you to our clients, my final thank you to our shareholders and my final thank you to all the people of Standard Chartered. These last couple of years has been pretty tough, but we have demonstrated resilience and an ability to adapt and reinvent. I know that Standard Chartered will once again show the world what a great bank this is.\r\nThank you.\r\nJohn, Andy, Mike and I will now take questions in London. Jaspal, Ben, May and Julian will take your questions in Hong Kong. Thank you very much.\r\nIt's the usual procedure, if you can -- if I'll point you at and then we'll wait for a mic, and then if you can say your name and your institution. So why don't we start on the right-hand side at the front?",
      "transcript_text3": "It's Rohith Chandra-Rajan from Barclays. I guess the 2 areas I'd like to focus on are RWAs and costs, which seem to be the key really to your 10% ROE target. So -- and similar questions actually on both. So the risk-weighted asset reduction of $25 billion to $30 billion, could you just clarify whether that's a net or a gross number? So really how we should think about the evolution of the balance sheet. Sort of it's about 8% of risk-weighted assets. And related to that, how much is from disposals? So RWAs, net or gross, and how much of that is from disposals?\n\n---\n\nAnd your second question?\n\n---\n\nSecond question was on costs. So the underlying cost reductions of, x disposals, $400 million to $500 million a year is a little bit above where inflation was in 2014. You also had regulatory costs on top of that. So just wondering whether you're guiding to something like flat costs over the next few years or whether there's some underlying cost inflation or reduction.\n\n---\n\nShould I take the cost one? And then do you want to do the RWA one? We can do them in reverse order. On the cost one, as you say, we do face inflation. So you've got $1.8 billion over the 3 years. On the other hand, inflation, particularly salary inflation, runs at about 5%. And to keep matters simple, we have a cost base of roughly $10 billion, so it's quite easy to do the mathematics there. The 2 other factors you have to think about are the future trajectory of regulatory costs, which it is difficult to predict precisely. They've clearly risen very sharply over the last couple of years. And then to the -- then the pace of income growth, which in and of itself also can have an impact on -- a natural impact on costs. So that's the way you can think about the dynamics of the $1.8 billion and how it translates into the cost trajectory for the group as a whole. Do you want to pick up on the point on RWA?\n\n---\n\nYes. On the RWA, it's taking gross cost out, so it is looking at where we are getting lower returns coming through. And it is also primarily on an organic basis running the business and it's through operation that will be the delivery of it. Clearly, as we run the business, we will be looking at opportunities to further grow the business, but this is specifically taking out areas where the returns are just not where we need them to be.\n\n---\n\nOkay, should we go to John-Paul? And then we can slip back. We'll come over to this side in a minute.\n\n---\n\nPeter, it's John-Paul Crutchley, JP, from UBS. I just wanted maybe to take a step back actually and just try and reflect on the sort of shape of where we think Standard Chartered is once you've gone through this sort of rebasing, reorganization in terms of around capital and costs. Because I mean if you're guiding this to something like 10% return-on-equity bank, given where the dividend currently is, that looks like you're going to be paying out roughly half of that earnings, at least in the short-term, by way of distribution. So I mean, should we really be thinking about it as being a lower-growth, fundamentally more mature bank in the markets it's operating in? Or why was -- and maybe a question for the Chairman is that why was the dividend not given the greater scrutiny perhaps in terms of rebasing to actually facilitate greater growth longer term? Because it just seems [ph] in terms of the tension around returns, the dividend and capital generation to fund the growth that you've got quite a degree of sort of straitjacket around you.\n\n---\n\nShould I start then, John? And then if you want to add your comments. Look, we're making it very clear that our focus right now is on the capital position and on returns. And in 2015, the priority is capital. However, we are a bank which is positioned in some of the most attractive growth markets in the world. And the economics of the bank are better when it is growing, so I do not see in the medium-term a tension between growth and returns. I actually think they are mutually reinforcing. But we need to make sure that, that growth is delivering the right returns, and hence the focus on RWA deployment and making sure that low-returning RWA, we sort of get it out of the system. In terms of dividends, we're very, very conscious of the importance to our -- of dividends to our shareholders. And we are very conscious of the decisions we make about that in the context of our capital-accretion objectives. John, did you want to...\n\n---\n\nWell, I would just echo what Peter said. The board has really focused on capital. You can see that from the presentation today. And clearly, shareholder, shareholder value and dividends is something that we, clearly on a regular basis, talk about with a great deal of importance. But I think, today, 2015, the board is comfortable that we have adequate levels of capital. We've talked today about trajectory. That's very important so that we can accrete capital going forward, but we're soon going to have a new chief executive. And I think, clearly, what Bill will do will continue to focus on capital, on issues surrounding dividend and so on, but I think, at this stage today, the board is very confident that we can achieve between 11% and 12%. And that's why both Peter and Andy and their presentations really focused on that as a key priority.\n\n---\n\nTom? Should we go on this side? And we'll take a few on this side then?\n\n---\n\nTom Rayner from Exane. I wanted to ask a question, please, to give you one last chance to get my name right, so you've done it. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nI know. I did well. I did well, didn't I?\n\n---\n\nCan I just, firstly, ask on the new 11% to 12% capital target range? I mean it does look realistic. I would suggest maybe towards the top end of the range once you put a sort of normal sort of management buffer on top of all the likely minimum requirements. But that target, I'm assuming, and this is really the first question, will take account of any future RWA inflation that might come around as a result of various proposals that are out there, so you'll still be targeting 11% to 12% regardless of what the RWA base is. And then I have a second question, on the revenue side, please.\n\n---\n\nI think the short answer to that is, within reason, yes but \"we know what we know\" sort of thing. But yes, we are planning to get to that ratio, absorbing some -- absorbing the things that we know are coming down the pike in terms of changes, although the magnitude of some of those is quite -- or the timing of them is quite difficult to know. Is that reasonable?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think so. I mean we start with a sort of 200-basis-point headroom. We know there are things coming down. And as Peter says, quantifying some of them is a bit tricky, but our view is, 11% to 12%, net of those, that is where we should be.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just back to the $25 billion to $30 billion RWA. Now I know this might not be a net reduction, but I would've thought that a lot of it would be, to be consistent with the capital. So my question is really why, when trying to calculate a revenue impact, would I not just take the \"revenue to risk-weighted asset\" ratio, call it, 0.5% and apply it to that number and come up with $1.5 billion to $2 billion per annum? Why would that not be the...\n\n---\n\nWell, because we're not stupid. When -- and we...\n\n---\n\nWhat kind of comment are you making?\n\n---\n\nI mean I'm sorry to answer it like that, but --\r\nit's very vague. We did say we were going to take the low-returning RWA, right, so it is not going to be the average; and also that we are going to be redeploying some of it. So the -- I mean you should anticipate pretty muted RWA growth, but it will be a combination of growth at attractive returns and us being very aggressive on pruning the RWA that is currently deployed that is generating substantially below-the-average income per RWA.\n\n---\n\nHalf the average?\n\n---\n\nSubstantially below the income on RWA. And actually, our experience has been, thus far, it is quite difficult to predict because, actually when you go into these situations in individual client relationships, sometimes, what you do is you actually exit the relationship and the RWA falls out. Sometimes, what you do is you end up with a repositioned relationship generating substantially more return on the same. And that's actually been -- we've been surprised on the upside on that.\n\n---\n\nYou should also assume in the future he'll not remember your name again after that question.\n\n---\n\nI've got a whole new Chief Executive to...\n\n---\n\nTo confuse. I think you should -- why don't you just hand the mic next door, yes.\n\n---\n\nIt's Arturo de Frias from Santander. 2 questions also on revenue impacts and capital ratios, similar to what just Tom asked but with a slightly different angle. On the revenue side, you say that the $450 million revenue impact is -- or has been calculated taking into account measures already taken and measures to be taken in 2015. So my question would be, are those most of the total measures that you need to take? i.e. if I ask in a different way, out of the $25 billion to $30 billion RWA reduction, how much of that should happen in 2015? And hence, how much of the revenue reduction can be compared with the $25 billion to $30 billion? i.e. when you finish cutting your $30 billion RWAs, the total revenue impact is going to be $450 million. Or is it going to be more than that?\n\n---\n\nAnd what's your second question?\n\n---\n\nThe second question is on capital ratios. I just would like you to help me understand why you think 11% to 12% is enough. Because I mean we have heard in the last few days that every other U.K. bank is targeting 12%, if not 13%, and that trend is also expanding to Continental Europe. I mean we are seeing simpler or at least less-diversified, less-global retail operations targeting also 12% fully loaded core. I mean you are clearly a more global bank. You are clearly present in more volatile markets. Why do you think 11% to 12% is enough, and not 12% to 13%?\n\n---\n\nOkay, I'll give a high-level response to both, and then Andy can work out whether I got it right or not. On the income, the first point is a clarification one. The $450 million refers specifically to income related to exits or disposals that we will, in the future, exclude from underlying numbers because they will be in the category of discontinued businesses. However, the income impact of things like de-risking or RWA is on top of that. So the $450 million is, just very specifically, it's things like our Hong Kong consumer finance business, the equities business, the UAE SME business. They'll be separately identified. So there will be an income impact from RWA stuff as well, but by its nature, it is not so easy to split out in quite the same precise manner. On the 11% to 12%, the -- none of us know quite where capital ratios are going to end up sort of 5, 10 years from now, but what we do know is that our known minimum requirements at the moment are 200 basis points lower than our capital ratio. We also know that the trend is for that 8.7% to drift upwards. We want to ensure that we maintain a substantial and sensible buffer above that number as it drifts upwards. And we think that 11% to 12% represents a sensible place for us to be. If that turns out, some years down the road, that it needs to be a different one, then presumably it won't be me but other people will make a different decision. But this is an attainable target and maintains a buffer relative to known requirements that is, to my knowledge, stronger than any other U.K. bank has. Was that all right?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think that's pretty good, actually. Yes, I mean I would look at you've got this year -- sorry, you've got, 2014 year, we've got $450 million of income, which broadly won't be there in 2015. Of course, we have disposal of businesses, or we are in the process of it. And as on the same slide, there's a $300 million drag last year in the income from the work we did on risk-weighted asset reductions. There will be some more of that this year, which clearly will have an impact upon income. And I think, just on the sort of 11% to 12%, bear in mind that things like the G-SIFI requirement do vary between banks. And we are at the lower end of that and that's probably one of the more stable ones in there. So purely looking at this in absolutes, there's a debate about whether it should be absolute or whether there should be relative headroom. And also, I think it's a piece about being realistic about where we are now, if we get to that stage where we're having a nice discussion about popping out above 12%, that's fantastic. But for now, we're below 11%. We need to go above 11%, and that's where we're going to focus.\n\n---\n\nWell, yes?\n\n---\n\nRight. Sorry, I wasn't paying attention. Let's go over here, to the right. Haven't drunk enough coffee this morning.\n\n---\n\nChintan Joshi from Nomura. Can I kind of carry on, on the RWA topic? It seems to me -- firstly, kudos that you seem to have presented a plan that's at least halfway to when new management would take this. So you're kind of giving it in a reasonable shape onwards, but why not more RWA reduction? Are you thinking about taking 16% of the cost base out? Even if I do some of the math, it feels like you will need quite a substantial revenue improvement to get to about to your 10% or more ROE target. It seems like it's a little light on RWA reduction, especially when we are talking about regulatory requirements going upwards in the future. So that's the first question. Second is on cost savings. I was quite -- I mean I've always regarded Standard Chartered as tech savvy, so when, in your cost-saving description, you said more digitization, kind of a bit surprising for me. I would have thought Standard Chartered would already be quite on top of digitization at least. And I think, on retail side, it feels more like it's a scale problem rather than a technology problem. So if you could elaborate on that. And one very quick one: On trade finance -- or rather Transaction Banking, perhaps for Andy, if you take a mark to market of the kind of commodity price moves, shouldn't your trade finance book be down automatically just on the back of collateral values going down?\n\n---\n\nOkay, why don't we have fun with this one? We've got 3 different questions. Maybe I'll start on the technology one. Perhaps you could talk, Mike, a bit about the practicalities of RWA reduction and why one has to take quite a balanced approach to that? And you can have the fun with the trade finance one. On the technology, well I'm delighted that you think we're quite advanced on technology, Chintan. And frankly, that is the case. If you look at the percentage of processes that -- or transactions that are done on a straight-through basis and the degree of standardization of platforms globally, I think we benchmark very favorably against any bank in the world. However, what we would say is that banks are probably less digitized than many other industries, partly because of the complications of regulations and jurisdictional issues, and that there is a massive opportunity for banks to become even more digital. In fact, when you think about it, what a bank is, none of what we do as bankers is inherently physical, so we shouldn't really have all this paper and all this kind of stuff. We should be able to digitize the whole thing. Now we are not there yet, but if you really, really want to make banks substantially more productive, which I think they will have to become given the scale of the regulatory costs and capital requirements, then the only answer is through intense use of technology in absolutely everything that we do. So we think we are in a good place relative to peers, but we think that there is a hell of a lot more to go for. Mike, did you want to talk about the RWA issues?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, the RWA, this is not a new thing. We've been at this now for a number of years. And so last year, we got RWA efficiencies of around $9 billion. I can't actually remember the figure from the year before, but has been a multiyear. So you've got to look at it in terms of a multiyear program, and what we're doing is turning the pressure up on that program. And as Peter said earlier, the challenge here is that you want to get the balance between -- if you're in the relationship, the first thing you want to do is to see if you can squeeze out to get the multiproduct -- multimarket ratio up because that gives you the kicker on return. So it's not as blunt as saying, when anything matures, then you're out, because that misses the opportunity. If you're in the relationship, the first thing you're trying to do is get the return up to get the RWA optimization. That requires a really detailed, focused, intensive process. And the pinch point for that doesn't naturally come up every year, so where you tend to be losing return is on the bilaterals, on the standby facilities, on those types of transactions, which may be 1, 2 to 3 years. So the point of real leverage with the relationship is when the maturity comes up on that standby facility, so both the timing and the tenor of the maturity of it, which gives you the leverage, but also the intensity of focus because what you really want to do is to get the return up and not exit the client. You want more RWA efficiency rather than actually getting the RWA back because, if you get the RWA back, you've then got to find another client to invest in at the return and you start again. It's always better to start with a client you're already banking where you've got some sort of depth of relationship and longevity. So there's no easy silver bullet to this. It's about a very intensive process and getting the timing right. And this is something we've been at for 2 to 3 years, and what we're doing is turning the intensity up to say, when you've got returns down at 1% return on risk-weighted assets, that's a -- but as you get up, going up and dealing with the higher returns, then it gets more of a nuanced conversation.\n\n---\n\nAnd I think the thing that's different for us perhaps than some other institutions is some other institutions had a whole chunk of RWA in securities portfolios or particular things, and they could just foreclose those down and lop them off. What we're talking about is client-by-client optimization of the deployment of capital into those relationships. Did you want to pick up on the trade point?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean I think, before I get to your question correctly, I suppose 2 observations. One is that, in the trade finance space in the commodities area at the moment, if you take something like oil, if we were financing a barrel, it was a $100 price ticket previously. It's now half that. And we're having to either run at twice the rate to make the same money or run at half the rate to get -- or same rate to get half the money. So there is a volume sort of element to that, which is more tricky. Your point about collateralization with it, I think the positive there is that we are on relatively short turning. So most of this is turning over pretty fast. We're very alert to the pricing of it, and hence, as things rotate off and new things come on, we will take a new view as to the collateral level that we need. So I think, overall, it sort of self-solves broadly.\n\n---\n\nAnd is it fair to say that there's negative volume pressure just because of the commodity [indiscernible] relatively immaterial?\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely. I mean, in trade -- correct. I mean, in trade, the margins have held up. The volumes have been low.\n\n---\n\nOkay, should we go into the middle of that block? Well, I can't actually see people very clearly.\n\n---\n\nIt's Manus Costello from Autonomous. Andy, you spent a while in your presentation talking about the difficulty in assessing coverage ratios from the outside, which I fully understand. So if I look at the Wholesale Banking coverage ratio, over the last several years, it's dropped fairly dramatically from kind of the 80s down to just 46% this year. And if I look at it relative to international peers, it looks pretty low as well. A lot of those are north of -- or 100% or even north of 100%. So my question would be why has your assumption on recoveries during that period improved so much. And why do you think your assumptions on recovery in wholesale are so much better than your global peers?\n\n---\n\nI mean, first of all, direct comparisons with others are always tricky. The mix and the type of transaction they are doing and the mix and type of transaction that we are doing and the nature of the other party and so on clearly do vary. Secondly, the level of collateral that we require may or may not be the same as that which others require. My main comfort on this is that, evidentially, if you look at what recovery rate we do get on our problem loans, it equates very, very closely to the value we have got on our books, net of provision and collateral. And that is a full sale value of collateral as well. It's not just a sort of gross theoretical number. So I think, for me, that is fact based. It's specific to our business. It is evidential, and it's not sort of trying to do comparisons with others where we're sort of second-guessing what their own position should be.\n\n---\n\nWhat about in comparison with yourself historically? I mean, why has that come down historically? Why was 80% appropriate several years ago and now 46% is?\n\n---\n\nDid it used to be as high as that...\n\n---\n\nI don't remember that.\n\n---\n\nI -- we'll -- can we take that offline? Because I don't think it was...\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible] maybe. We need to look at that.\n\n---\n\nBut we'll come back, we can come back to that.\n\n---\n\nIf that was the trend.\n\n---\n\nShould we go sail on this side? Why don't you just pass the mic in front -- or to the side, yes -- or front and then to the side, okay.\n\n---\n\nSorry for that. Martin Leitgeb from Goldman. Just 3 questions, please. The first one, on the RWA reduction. Is there any particular geographic focus to that? Or is that more the scene very broadly in terms of your footprint? The second question is with regards to prudential valuation adjustments in capital going forward. And I think you have guided historically that you might see headwinds there. Could you help us size what the potential impact here might be over the next 1 or 2 years? And last question, maybe a bit technical, on footnote 12 to the financial statements, other assets: I think you haven't disclosed the fair value of other assets as of the end of '14. And I was just wondering if you could give us an indication if this position is relatively close or if there's quite a valuation gap there.\n\n---\n\nI think, well, let's keep the first one.\n\n---\n\nYes, first one [ph]. Very simple. There's no particular geographic focus, but there is a sector focus, and that comes from the leverage of the returns. So we know, for example, bank trade has very little leverage. Bank trade doesn't cover its return on risk-weighted assets in cost of equity, and it's very difficult to get cross-sell into foreign exchange and Cash Management. Relative to corporate trade, where you can go to corporate trade, you get FX and you get cash, so you can get the leverage. So there's more about where the opportunity to get the leverage is, and I think it's more sector based than probably geographical based.\n\n---\n\nOn the PVA point, there are loads of different actual and potential changes in regulatory treatment that affect capital and I don't want us to get too locked into it. It's X basis points of -- because we could fill the rest of the Q&A session dealing with that. The point is we know that. We know that's coming. And what we're telling you is that we're going to get to 11% to 12%, and we're going to do it this year. On the last point?\n\n---\n\nAnd to your last point, we have endeavored to actually make the press release a little bit more concise than last time, which has actually reduced it from about 150 to 100 pages, so there's a little less detail in that.\n\n---\n\nHe failed, actually. The target was 100 -- oh, it is 100 pages. Overnight, it's gone down from 101 to 100. Well done, well done.\n\n---\n\nI knew what the question was coming from. The good news is that, when the ARA is published, you will be able to find out the answer to your question.\n\n---\n\nShould we take one more over the side? Ian?\n\n---\n\nIt's Ian Gordon from Investec. I was just slightly surprised that your liability growth was as strong as it was in the second half, led by time deposits and, if I've read it correctly, led by the Americas and, to a lesser extent, Europe. Can you just explain the thinking behind that? And perhaps just wrap it into the comment on your interest rate, sensitivity to a rising interest rate environment if and when we get there?\n\n---\n\nWell, should I take the second part of that, first? And then Mike, you might want to talk about the dynamic driving deposit growth and particularly in the Americas. We are sensitive to interest rates as an institution. Rising interest rates is a good thing for Standard Chartered. Steeper yield curves are a good thing for Standard Chartered. It is impossible to be precise on the impact of them because you have to play out a scenario of a particular shape of the curve, and particular interest rates and how it is across different currencies. We have talked about in the past of shifts in interest rates being things that could drive our numbers by several hundred million dollars. These are not -- it is not a small driver of income for the bank. And it's been one of the things that has depressed returns, particularly impacting the economics of the Cash Management business and also retail deposits. Did you want to comment on the growth in deposits?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean one of the truths of banking is it's always good to be liquid and more and more liquid because it gives you optionality. So deposit-raising strategies with clients is a long-term thing which you don't pull the levers. You don't turn on and off. So just because assets are muted and the return you can get is muted, you don't stop the long-term haul of raising currency from retail, cash management deposits from corporates. That's a long-term gain. As you go into that, corporates -- why do people actually put deposits with you, they don't leave it in cars or/and overnight savings. They don't want to go into fixed and everything else. So you do get a change in the mix as you continue to go down that. So our deposit-raising strategy is a long-term strategy. And irrespective the asset side, we will continue on that because it is the right thing to do for sustainable growth of the bank. In particular, U.S. is a -- there's been a particular growth in deposits in the U.S., and that's a strange phenomenon, which is as we've rationalized our correspondent banking business, and Andy talked about a number of relationships, many people are doing as well. So what's happening is we're getting more business from fewer relationships. And so that's particularly coming through the Cash Management related to correspondent banking.\n\n---\n\nOkay, more questions? Why don't we come over here [indiscernible]? Oh sorry, it's just somebody -- why don't -- in front, and then we'll come further back. And if we can keep them quite succinct, we'll try and keep our answers quite succinct because I'm conscious of time.\n\n---\n\nIt's Jason from Deutsche Bank. 2 questions. First of all, on the cost of achieving the headline cost savings. Can you give us any guidance as to expectations around restructuring over the 3 years? You obviously know this year, I guess, in greater deal, so some sense as to what the capital drag from restructuring charges might be. And then secondly, just around the RWA release and efficiency program. From some of the numbers that you gave in the November slide deck, it appears that some of the higher-return product groups, if not relationships, are not delivering sort of what they're supposed to do, Principal Finance -- Corporate Finance is supposed to be where you get in with a CEO office and generate the much higher returns, at least that was my understanding of the group. And so I guess I'm trying to get a sense -- given the cost inflation that the firm faces, a lack of income is a problem. And so I wonder how you get to $25 billion as the lower bound; why the number isn't bigger, for example, such that you can aim for a higher ROE. That's a tricky one, but I guess the bottom line here is, if you really did have a blank piece of paper, would the new strategy not be more aggressive, more fundamentally different from where you are today?\n\n---\n\nDo you want to pick up on the cost one?\n\n---\n\nI was going to say, the first one, the answer is no. The second one, I -- listen, we've got 180 of restructuring costs in 2014. We are working on the programs that are going to head to the $1.8 billion. We do not have the details of exactly what the one-off costs are in order to get there. I mean, on the second one, I guess my point would be what we are trying to do clearly is to triangulate the capital return, increased return on equity and the funding of dividends. And it is a triangulation of those. It's not just the whole focus upon 1. We are trying to solve for all 3.\n\n---\n\nAnd ultimately, you've got to look at it at the level of individual client relationships. And so you can't solve just for the Principal Finance aspect of the client relationship or the Corporate Finance aspect of it. And so the key is -- and this is why it does take a bit of time. It is client by client, looking at the overarching relationship. Sorry, I -- should we go on to -- behind you?\n\n---\n\nIt's Fahed Kunwar speaking, from Redburn. My first question is on revenues. It's helpful guidance on the venue hit going forward, but on your ongoing business, it seems like a lot of your peers, including yourself, are pouring into the same kind of mass affluent kind of risk less -- or less-risky business. So the margins, which have come down in '14 again, did they keep on coming down considering the liquidity into those businesses? The next part of the question, I guess, is jaws has always been quite an important determinant for yourselves. When we think about -- or you haven't even mentioned it in the slide pack, so thinking of the ongoing business and the group business, I guess, are you still looking at kind of flat to positive jaws going forward? Or do -- have you kind of stopped looking at it through that way? The question then on credit quality as well: On your kind of performing loans, your Grade 12 category, the Corporate and Institutional Clients have gone kind of $1.5 billion to $4.5 billion. Is that part of the review that you did on the commodity exposure that you're talking about as a one-off thing? Or is there something ongoing underlying there? And the last bit is a clarification point. How is the E calculated on your ROE?\n\n---\n\nI don't think we do anything particularly on ROE. It's a normalized ROE, and it's in the press release. You can derive it from the notes. On the more affluent point, look, the economics of retail banking are very clear that you'll make a disproportionate return on the more affluent customers relative to mass market customers, and that's not unique to us. That's something that I see across all retail banks. If you can pull the lever, relatively small shifts in the proportion of your income you get from what we call Priority customers can actually make a very material difference to your income, and we are making good progress on that. The income in Priority clients grew well, and it is driven a lot by non-balance-sheet items, particularly Wealth Management products and bancassurance. And you will see from the numbers that our bancassurance and Wealth Management income grew quite significantly. Do you want to pick up on the other questions, jaws, [indiscernible]?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean it's yes. The jaws one, we could have a long debate about. What we've decided is to go for hard numbers. We can target in the business hard numbers. And we can get programs together and deliver on hard numbers, and that's what we're going to do. And $1.8 billion over a 3-year period, it's going to be $400 million or $500 million a year. As you saw on the chart here, in 2014, that was a $200 million number, so actually, stepping up to $400 million, $500 million a year, it's going to be a big step-up. We're on track to do that in this year, and we will get there, but I prefer hard numbers. The other one, just on CG 12s and nonperforming, I mean, I suppose, if I sort of step back, the -- I suppose, 2 observations. One is that the nonperforming loans, compared with the first half, are up slightly, about $300 million; but the CG 12s, the worst category of performing, is actually $900 million lower than it was at the half year. And I think, therefore, one sort of needs to take both of those into account. And when one looks at the overall position, it's why we're sort of saying we're sort of okay where we're at. But I do think that the 2 together are probably the answer.\n\n---\n\nI'm conscious of timing, and I don't want to keep people longer than they want to be, but there are a lot of questions still in the room. So we'll go for another sort of 10 minutes or so, if that's okay with people. I'll take another question from this side, Duncan, just whoever's nearest you. Sorry.\n\n---\n\nChira from Bernstein. 2 quick questions. Peter, when it -- you put up that slide in terms of profit growth from when you became CEO here, one of the markets which helped you get there was India. We don't get too many questions out there. That's an economy in recovery. Can you give us a little brief about your franchise there? Is there fundamental things that are broken there and not being able to recover income? And the second thing was on Principal Finance, again, Andy, to your risk diagnosis. So how much capital is tied up in the business? What does the business actually represent? I saw that you have some gains in Q4? So how should we think about the business going forward?\n\n---\n\nSome combination of the 2. You can tackle the Principal Finance. On India, good question. India was a powerful driver of profit growth for us in earlier years in my tenure. And then at the time, actually, where India went through a difficult couple of years, it was a difficult couple of years for us too, and our profits in India fell quite sharply. I think we are now in a -- like India, we are India itself. We are in a process of transition, where there are some very encouraging signs. We have a government that is much more dynamic in terms of reform. We have a central bank governor who is, as recent immediate events suggest, is very actively managing the monetary situation within the economy. We see all those as very, very positive signs. However, there is quite a sort of overhang of the paralysis that affected India over the last couple of years. So we -- I -- we see this as a sort of transitional phase for both the economy and for our business in India. However, over the medium-term, we remain extremely positive. We have a very, very strong franchise there. There's nothing sort of broken about it at all. It's a very strong client franchise, and we are very positive over the medium term over India's prospects.\n\n---\n\nOn the Principal Finance one, it goes back to a previous question as well. On Principal Finance, the economics of that business are attractive on a standalone basis, but what you don't see, which was the previous question, is the leverage it gives us with the clients. But that's not in Principal Finance. That comes out in terms of Cash Management, FX. And the leverage we get is very significant, but that's in the broader relationship and it comes back to Peter's point. So assets at work [ph] amount to about $2.3 billion in Principal Finance, and the leverage that gives us with our clients on a client basis is very significant and very significantly higher than the product -- the economics of the product, which in and of itself are already attractive. The other thing is you'll notice our Principal Finance assets are down year-on-year because that gives us another opportunity in terms of repackaging that. And Peter talked earlier about the importance of the growth of our institutional investor segment, so we give it an opportunity there for good assets which we can create so it -- the leverage it gives us is more than just standing alone looking at the individual product economics.\n\n---\n\nOkay, in this side, should we take a -- who's got a mic? Where is the mic? Oh, sorry, you've got it. Why don't we take this one? And then we'll come over to this side. Can I limit people to one question a person? Because -- as a discipline?\n\n---\n\nIt's hard to...\n\n---\n\nYou could limit to one answer...\n\n---\n\nWe could limit it by giving one answer, right. Yes, that's a good idea.\n\n---\n\nPeter, it's [indiscernible]. I'll keep it to one question. I just -- did you have a methodological change in the way you calculate NPLs in Africa? Because if I look at the, say, for the first half for 2014, they're now on Page 51, $471 million of gross NPLs. And in your last report for the half year, they were $966 million. And there hasn't been a big change in the loan balance, so I was just wondering if there was a methodology change or if something came out of NPLs that was significant. Because it is a big -- it's about a $495 million drop down.\n\n---\n\nYes, yes, [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\nYes, they've been put on a financial basis. We'll even explain that to you afterwards, but they're now on an equivalent basis.\n\n---\n\nThe actual aggregate NPLs hasn't changed. We just moved it. Okay.\n\n---\n\nIt's Ligor Drin [ph] from Royal Bank of Canada. I was going to ask you about AT1s in your statement, but as I can only ask one question, I would be interested to know whether you're going to quantify that for us, though. So are they...\n\n---\n\nThat's a very sly way of doing it, isn't it? What is your question?\n\n---\n\nActually, my question was more like -- my question is on dividends. And I wasn't quite sure what you're saying your strategy on dividends is. It feels like it's sort of the $0.86 is something you're either putting there as a holding pattern until you've had a new Chief Executive that has a look at it, or you're actually saying we're going to grow into that and from there be progressive. I wonder whether you could just clarify what the new dividend strategy is, if there is a new one.\n\n---\n\nWell, I think the thing we would say is we are acutely conscious of the importance of dividends to our shareholders, the important role it plays in the value our shareholders get from investing in Standard Chartered. And we are also managing our capital ratios very assertively, and we have set out a very clear target. Doing stuff with the dividend is not the first port of call because of the importance of it to our shareholders. And we are using the levers that we can control to get to where we want to get to on the capital ratio. I don't know if you wanted to add more on that.\n\n---\n\nI think it's very important. And that's why, again today, we're talking about trajectory on our capital, on our Common Equity Tier 1 capital. And we're confident of getting between 11% and 12%. And so as Peter said, we have then levers we can pull, and the board could choose which priorities and which levers to pull at any time.\n\n---\n\nOkay, Chris?\n\n---\n\nIt's Chris Manners from Morgan Stanley. One question it is, then. So I was looking at your ROE target of just over 10% in the medium term. And I remember, at the half year results, you did explain there is actually really good revenue growth opportunities. I think you put up a slide from McKinsey showing maybe 10% compound annual growth rate in banking revenue pools in the markets that you're in over the next sort of 5 years or so. If you're only to do 10% ROE, presumably you can only grow TNAV by 10%, only grow RWAs by 10% and then basically manage to grow revenues in line with the revenue pool if you pay out 0. Or how do you make a payout...\n\n---\n\nWe're not saying we're limiting ourselves to a 10% ROE, but given that -- your maths is fine, but given that we are below a 10% ROE, to set a number that is significantly higher would seem not sensible at this point. Our first priority is to get ourselves to a 10% ROE, and then we'll worry about the pace of growth and stuff thereafter. Sandy? And then I -- if we could make this the last question, I think, because otherwise I think we really will overrun. Yes? Pressure's on, it's got to be a good question.\n\n---\n\nAll right, okay. Yes. $10 billion in costs, 2/3 of that in staffing. The -- I was wondering if you could cut it, no pun intended, along staffing lines between the sort of country-based people and sort of business-based versus back-office side. And where I'm getting at is that kind of that I've looked at you guys as long as you've been sitting there, and it always struck me that sort of a lot of the problems seem to come from the country side versus the sort of business side of Standard Chartered. So if you do focus a lot of the headcount reductions and cost reductions on the country-based management structure, might there be an upside in terms of lower regulatory charges as well?\n\n---\n\nThe reality is we run a matrix, and we have some businesses that globally are more efficient than others, and we have some geographies that, for any given business, are more or less efficient than others, so there is a -- both a geographic and a business line dimension to the efficiency equation. So for example, our Korea business in retail is not nearly as efficient as we would like. We've been taking assertive action on that. The number of branches is down by something like 60 or so, and we've been reducing the headcount. But also, if I look at retail globally, we think it has a cost-income ratio that is just simply too high, and that's on a global basis. So we are looking at efficiency. And frankly, to deliver the $1.8 billion, we have to do this. We are looking at it both ways. So it's not a question of saying we're going to take a country perspective or a business perspective. We're going to take a look at every perspective. And the other thing we are doing is we are looking very hard at the processes which cut across different client segments and parts of the bank and saying, \"Let's try and standardize and optimize those as far as possible,\" so we minimize having different processes doing roughly the same thing or duplication around the institution. So this is...\n\n---\n\nThat was more my point, yes.\n\n---\n\nThere's stuff to go for. And as I said earlier, the trick to doing all of this is technology. It's very difficult to -- there are some opportunities where you can actually stop doing something, but most of the time, the opportunity is to do it in a way that is much more efficient. And if you can take people out of the equation, that's the most powerful way of making it more efficient.\r\nI think we have run out of time. I don't know, John, whether you wanted to make any closing comments?\n\n---\n\nVery briefly.\r\nStandard Chartered is a very good bank. It's going through a transition. It's going through change. And I hope what we've been able to do today is give you the confidence that we really have been listening to our shareholders. We really are taking action to refresh the strategy and get the bank in very good shape for the future. And although 2014 was disappointing, we still think the future and the emerging markets, some very exciting markets, in the world offer great opportunities for this bank.\r\nAnd thank you, all, for coming today.\n\n---\n\nYes, thank you very much.\n\n---\n\nYes, thank you.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Rohith Chandra-Rajan (Analysts)】\nIt's Rohith Chandra-Rajan from Barclays. I guess the 2 areas I'd like to focus on are RWAs and costs, which seem to be the key really to your 10% ROE target. So -- and similar questions actually on both. So the risk-weighted asset reduction of $25 billion to $30 billion, could you just clarify whether that's a net or a gross number? So really how we should think about the evolution of the balance sheet. Sort of it's about 8% of risk-weighted assets. And related to that, how much is from disposals? So RWAs, net or gross, and how much of that is from disposals?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nAnd your second question?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rohith Chandra-Rajan (Analysts)】\nSecond question was on costs. So the underlying cost reductions of, x disposals, $400 million to $500 million a year is a little bit above where inflation was in 2014. You also had regulatory costs on top of that. So just wondering whether you're guiding to something like flat costs over the next few years or whether there's some underlying cost inflation or reduction.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nShould I take the cost one? And then do you want to do the RWA one? We can do them in reverse order. On the cost one, as you say, we do face inflation. So you've got $1.8 billion over the 3 years. On the other hand, inflation, particularly salary inflation, runs at about 5%. And to keep matters simple, we have a cost base of roughly $10 billion, so it's quite easy to do the mathematics there. The 2 other factors you have to think about are the future trajectory of regulatory costs, which it is difficult to predict precisely. They've clearly risen very sharply over the last couple of years. And then to the -- then the pace of income growth, which in and of itself also can have an impact on -- a natural impact on costs. So that's the way you can think about the dynamics of the $1.8 billion and how it translates into the cost trajectory for the group as a whole. Do you want to pick up on the point on RWA?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrew Halford (Executives)】\nYes. On the RWA, it's taking gross cost out, so it is looking at where we are getting lower returns coming through. And it is also primarily on an organic basis running the business and it's through operation that will be the delivery of it. Clearly, as we run the business, we will be looking at opportunities to further grow the business, but this is specifically taking out areas where the returns are just not where we need them to be.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nOkay, should we go to John-Paul? And then we can slip back. We'll come over to this side in a minute.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John-Paul Crutchley (Analysts)】\nPeter, it's John-Paul Crutchley, JP, from UBS. I just wanted maybe to take a step back actually and just try and reflect on the sort of shape of where we think Standard Chartered is once you've gone through this sort of rebasing, reorganization in terms of around capital and costs. Because I mean if you're guiding this to something like 10% return-on-equity bank, given where the dividend currently is, that looks like you're going to be paying out roughly half of that earnings, at least in the short-term, by way of distribution. So I mean, should we really be thinking about it as being a lower-growth, fundamentally more mature bank in the markets it's operating in? Or why was -- and maybe a question for the Chairman is that why was the dividend not given the greater scrutiny perhaps in terms of rebasing to actually facilitate greater growth longer term? Because it just seems [ph] in terms of the tension around returns, the dividend and capital generation to fund the growth that you've got quite a degree of sort of straitjacket around you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nShould I start then, John? And then if you want to add your comments. Look, we're making it very clear that our focus right now is on the capital position and on returns. And in 2015, the priority is capital. However, we are a bank which is positioned in some of the most attractive growth markets in the world. And the economics of the bank are better when it is growing, so I do not see in the medium-term a tension between growth and returns. I actually think they are mutually reinforcing. But we need to make sure that, that growth is delivering the right returns, and hence the focus on RWA deployment and making sure that low-returning RWA, we sort of get it out of the system. In terms of dividends, we're very, very conscious of the importance to our -- of dividends to our shareholders. And we are very conscious of the decisions we make about that in the context of our capital-accretion objectives. John, did you want to...\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Peace (Executives)】\nWell, I would just echo what Peter said. The board has really focused on capital. You can see that from the presentation today. And clearly, shareholder, shareholder value and dividends is something that we, clearly on a regular basis, talk about with a great deal of importance. But I think, today, 2015, the board is comfortable that we have adequate levels of capital. We've talked today about trajectory. That's very important so that we can accrete capital going forward, but we're soon going to have a new chief executive. And I think, clearly, what Bill will do will continue to focus on capital, on issues surrounding dividend and so on, but I think, at this stage today, the board is very confident that we can achieve between 11% and 12%. And that's why both Peter and Andy and their presentations really focused on that as a key priority.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nTom? Should we go on this side? And we'll take a few on this side then?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Rayner (Analysts)】\nTom Rayner from Exane. I wanted to ask a question, please, to give you one last chance to get my name right, so you've done it. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nI know. I did well. I did well, didn't I?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Rayner (Analysts)】\nCan I just, firstly, ask on the new 11% to 12% capital target range? I mean it does look realistic. I would suggest maybe towards the top end of the range once you put a sort of normal sort of management buffer on top of all the likely minimum requirements. But that target, I'm assuming, and this is really the first question, will take account of any future RWA inflation that might come around as a result of various proposals that are out there, so you'll still be targeting 11% to 12% regardless of what the RWA base is. And then I have a second question, on the revenue side, please.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nI think the short answer to that is, within reason, yes but \"we know what we know\" sort of thing. But yes, we are planning to get to that ratio, absorbing some -- absorbing the things that we know are coming down the pike in terms of changes, although the magnitude of some of those is quite -- or the timing of them is quite difficult to know. Is that reasonable?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrew Halford (Executives)】\nYes, I think so. I mean we start with a sort of 200-basis-point headroom. We know there are things coming down. And as Peter says, quantifying some of them is a bit tricky, but our view is, 11% to 12%, net of those, that is where we should be.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Rayner (Analysts)】\nAnd then just back to the $25 billion to $30 billion RWA. Now I know this might not be a net reduction, but I would've thought that a lot of it would be, to be consistent with the capital. So my question is really why, when trying to calculate a revenue impact, would I not just take the \"revenue to risk-weighted asset\" ratio, call it, 0.5% and apply it to that number and come up with $1.5 billion to $2 billion per annum? Why would that not be the...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nWell, because we're not stupid. When -- and we...\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Peace (Executives)】\nWhat kind of comment are you making?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nI mean I'm sorry to answer it like that, but --\r\nit's very vague. We did say we were going to take the low-returning RWA, right, so it is not going to be the average; and also that we are going to be redeploying some of it. So the -- I mean you should anticipate pretty muted RWA growth, but it will be a combination of growth at attractive returns and us being very aggressive on pruning the RWA that is currently deployed that is generating substantially below-the-average income per RWA.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Rayner (Analysts)】\nHalf the average?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nSubstantially below the income on RWA. And actually, our experience has been, thus far, it is quite difficult to predict because, actually when you go into these situations in individual client relationships, sometimes, what you do is you actually exit the relationship and the RWA falls out. Sometimes, what you do is you end up with a repositioned relationship generating substantially more return on the same. And that's actually been -- we've been surprised on the upside on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Peace (Executives)】\nYou should also assume in the future he'll not remember your name again after that question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Rayner (Analysts)】\nI've got a whole new Chief Executive to...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nTo confuse. I think you should -- why don't you just hand the mic next door, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Arturo de Frias Marques (Analysts)】\nIt's Arturo de Frias from Santander. 2 questions also on revenue impacts and capital ratios, similar to what just Tom asked but with a slightly different angle. On the revenue side, you say that the $450 million revenue impact is -- or has been calculated taking into account measures already taken and measures to be taken in 2015. So my question would be, are those most of the total measures that you need to take? i.e. if I ask in a different way, out of the $25 billion to $30 billion RWA reduction, how much of that should happen in 2015? And hence, how much of the revenue reduction can be compared with the $25 billion to $30 billion? i.e. when you finish cutting your $30 billion RWAs, the total revenue impact is going to be $450 million. Or is it going to be more than that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nAnd what's your second question?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Arturo de Frias Marques (Analysts)】\nThe second question is on capital ratios. I just would like you to help me understand why you think 11% to 12% is enough. Because I mean we have heard in the last few days that every other U.K. bank is targeting 12%, if not 13%, and that trend is also expanding to Continental Europe. I mean we are seeing simpler or at least less-diversified, less-global retail operations targeting also 12% fully loaded core. I mean you are clearly a more global bank. You are clearly present in more volatile markets. Why do you think 11% to 12% is enough, and not 12% to 13%?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nOkay, I'll give a high-level response to both, and then Andy can work out whether I got it right or not. On the income, the first point is a clarification one. The $450 million refers specifically to income related to exits or disposals that we will, in the future, exclude from underlying numbers because they will be in the category of discontinued businesses. However, the income impact of things like de-risking or RWA is on top of that. So the $450 million is, just very specifically, it's things like our Hong Kong consumer finance business, the equities business, the UAE SME business. They'll be separately identified. So there will be an income impact from RWA stuff as well, but by its nature, it is not so easy to split out in quite the same precise manner. On the 11% to 12%, the -- none of us know quite where capital ratios are going to end up sort of 5, 10 years from now, but what we do know is that our known minimum requirements at the moment are 200 basis points lower than our capital ratio. We also know that the trend is for that 8.7% to drift upwards. We want to ensure that we maintain a substantial and sensible buffer above that number as it drifts upwards. And we think that 11% to 12% represents a sensible place for us to be. If that turns out, some years down the road, that it needs to be a different one, then presumably it won't be me but other people will make a different decision. But this is an attainable target and maintains a buffer relative to known requirements that is, to my knowledge, stronger than any other U.K. bank has. Was that all right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrew Halford (Executives)】\nYes. I think that's pretty good, actually. Yes, I mean I would look at you've got this year -- sorry, you've got, 2014 year, we've got $450 million of income, which broadly won't be there in 2015. Of course, we have disposal of businesses, or we are in the process of it. And as on the same slide, there's a $300 million drag last year in the income from the work we did on risk-weighted asset reductions. There will be some more of that this year, which clearly will have an impact upon income. And I think, just on the sort of 11% to 12%, bear in mind that things like the G-SIFI requirement do vary between banks. And we are at the lower end of that and that's probably one of the more stable ones in there. So purely looking at this in absolutes, there's a debate about whether it should be absolute or whether there should be relative headroom. And also, I think it's a piece about being realistic about where we are now, if we get to that stage where we're having a nice discussion about popping out above 12%, that's fantastic. But for now, we're below 11%. We need to go above 11%, and that's where we're going to focus.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Peace (Executives)】\nWell, yes?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nRight. Sorry, I wasn't paying attention. Let's go over here, to the right. Haven't drunk enough coffee this morning.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chintan Joshi (Analysts)】\nChintan Joshi from Nomura. Can I kind of carry on, on the RWA topic? It seems to me -- firstly, kudos that you seem to have presented a plan that's at least halfway to when new management would take this. So you're kind of giving it in a reasonable shape onwards, but why not more RWA reduction? Are you thinking about taking 16% of the cost base out? Even if I do some of the math, it feels like you will need quite a substantial revenue improvement to get to about to your 10% or more ROE target. It seems like it's a little light on RWA reduction, especially when we are talking about regulatory requirements going upwards in the future. So that's the first question. Second is on cost savings. I was quite -- I mean I've always regarded Standard Chartered as tech savvy, so when, in your cost-saving description, you said more digitization, kind of a bit surprising for me. I would have thought Standard Chartered would already be quite on top of digitization at least. And I think, on retail side, it feels more like it's a scale problem rather than a technology problem. So if you could elaborate on that. And one very quick one: On trade finance -- or rather Transaction Banking, perhaps for Andy, if you take a mark to market of the kind of commodity price moves, shouldn't your trade finance book be down automatically just on the back of collateral values going down?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nOkay, why don't we have fun with this one? We've got 3 different questions. Maybe I'll start on the technology one. Perhaps you could talk, Mike, a bit about the practicalities of RWA reduction and why one has to take quite a balanced approach to that? And you can have the fun with the trade finance one. On the technology, well I'm delighted that you think we're quite advanced on technology, Chintan. And frankly, that is the case. If you look at the percentage of processes that -- or transactions that are done on a straight-through basis and the degree of standardization of platforms globally, I think we benchmark very favorably against any bank in the world. However, what we would say is that banks are probably less digitized than many other industries, partly because of the complications of regulations and jurisdictional issues, and that there is a massive opportunity for banks to become even more digital. In fact, when you think about it, what a bank is, none of what we do as bankers is inherently physical, so we shouldn't really have all this paper and all this kind of stuff. We should be able to digitize the whole thing. Now we are not there yet, but if you really, really want to make banks substantially more productive, which I think they will have to become given the scale of the regulatory costs and capital requirements, then the only answer is through intense use of technology in absolutely everything that we do. So we think we are in a good place relative to peers, but we think that there is a hell of a lot more to go for. Mike, did you want to talk about the RWA issues?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alun Rees (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, the RWA, this is not a new thing. We've been at this now for a number of years. And so last year, we got RWA efficiencies of around $9 billion. I can't actually remember the figure from the year before, but has been a multiyear. So you've got to look at it in terms of a multiyear program, and what we're doing is turning the pressure up on that program. And as Peter said earlier, the challenge here is that you want to get the balance between -- if you're in the relationship, the first thing you want to do is to see if you can squeeze out to get the multiproduct -- multimarket ratio up because that gives you the kicker on return. So it's not as blunt as saying, when anything matures, then you're out, because that misses the opportunity. If you're in the relationship, the first thing you're trying to do is get the return up to get the RWA optimization. That requires a really detailed, focused, intensive process. And the pinch point for that doesn't naturally come up every year, so where you tend to be losing return is on the bilaterals, on the standby facilities, on those types of transactions, which may be 1, 2 to 3 years. So the point of real leverage with the relationship is when the maturity comes up on that standby facility, so both the timing and the tenor of the maturity of it, which gives you the leverage, but also the intensity of focus because what you really want to do is to get the return up and not exit the client. You want more RWA efficiency rather than actually getting the RWA back because, if you get the RWA back, you've then got to find another client to invest in at the return and you start again. It's always better to start with a client you're already banking where you've got some sort of depth of relationship and longevity. So there's no easy silver bullet to this. It's about a very intensive process and getting the timing right. And this is something we've been at for 2 to 3 years, and what we're doing is turning the intensity up to say, when you've got returns down at 1% return on risk-weighted assets, that's a -- but as you get up, going up and dealing with the higher returns, then it gets more of a nuanced conversation.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nAnd I think the thing that's different for us perhaps than some other institutions is some other institutions had a whole chunk of RWA in securities portfolios or particular things, and they could just foreclose those down and lop them off. What we're talking about is client-by-client optimization of the deployment of capital into those relationships. Did you want to pick up on the trade point?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrew Halford (Executives)】\nYes. I mean I think, before I get to your question correctly, I suppose 2 observations. One is that, in the trade finance space in the commodities area at the moment, if you take something like oil, if we were financing a barrel, it was a $100 price ticket previously. It's now half that. And we're having to either run at twice the rate to make the same money or run at half the rate to get -- or same rate to get half the money. So there is a volume sort of element to that, which is more tricky. Your point about collateralization with it, I think the positive there is that we are on relatively short turning. So most of this is turning over pretty fast. We're very alert to the pricing of it, and hence, as things rotate off and new things come on, we will take a new view as to the collateral level that we need. So I think, overall, it sort of self-solves broadly.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chintan Joshi (Analysts)】\nAnd is it fair to say that there's negative volume pressure just because of the commodity [indiscernible] relatively immaterial?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrew Halford (Executives)】\nAbsolutely. I mean, in trade -- correct. I mean, in trade, the margins have held up. The volumes have been low.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nOkay, should we go into the middle of that block? Well, I can't actually see people very clearly.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Manus Costello (Analysts)】\nIt's Manus Costello from Autonomous. Andy, you spent a while in your presentation talking about the difficulty in assessing coverage ratios from the outside, which I fully understand. So if I look at the Wholesale Banking coverage ratio, over the last several years, it's dropped fairly dramatically from kind of the 80s down to just 46% this year. And if I look at it relative to international peers, it looks pretty low as well. A lot of those are north of -- or 100% or even north of 100%. So my question would be why has your assumption on recoveries during that period improved so much. And why do you think your assumptions on recovery in wholesale are so much better than your global peers?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrew Halford (Executives)】\nI mean, first of all, direct comparisons with others are always tricky. The mix and the type of transaction they are doing and the mix and type of transaction that we are doing and the nature of the other party and so on clearly do vary. Secondly, the level of collateral that we require may or may not be the same as that which others require. My main comfort on this is that, evidentially, if you look at what recovery rate we do get on our problem loans, it equates very, very closely to the value we have got on our books, net of provision and collateral. And that is a full sale value of collateral as well. It's not just a sort of gross theoretical number. So I think, for me, that is fact based. It's specific to our business. It is evidential, and it's not sort of trying to do comparisons with others where we're sort of second-guessing what their own position should be.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Manus Costello (Analysts)】\nWhat about in comparison with yourself historically? I mean, why has that come down historically? Why was 80% appropriate several years ago and now 46% is?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrew Halford (Executives)】\nDid it used to be as high as that...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alun Rees (Executives)】\nI don't remember that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nI -- we'll -- can we take that offline? Because I don't think it was...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alun Rees (Executives)】\n[indiscernible] maybe. We need to look at that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nBut we'll come back, we can come back to that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alun Rees (Executives)】\nIf that was the trend.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nShould we go sail on this side? Why don't you just pass the mic in front -- or to the side, yes -- or front and then to the side, okay.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Martin Leitgeb (Analysts)】\nSorry for that. Martin Leitgeb from Goldman. Just 3 questions, please. The first one, on the RWA reduction. Is there any particular geographic focus to that? Or is that more the scene very broadly in terms of your footprint? The second question is with regards to prudential valuation adjustments in capital going forward. And I think you have guided historically that you might see headwinds there. Could you help us size what the potential impact here might be over the next 1 or 2 years? And last question, maybe a bit technical, on footnote 12 to the financial statements, other assets: I think you haven't disclosed the fair value of other assets as of the end of '14. And I was just wondering if you could give us an indication if this position is relatively close or if there's quite a valuation gap there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nI think, well, let's keep the first one.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alun Rees (Executives)】\nYes, first one [ph]. Very simple. There's no particular geographic focus, but there is a sector focus, and that comes from the leverage of the returns. So we know, for example, bank trade has very little leverage. Bank trade doesn't cover its return on risk-weighted assets in cost of equity, and it's very difficult to get cross-sell into foreign exchange and Cash Management. Relative to corporate trade, where you can go to corporate trade, you get FX and you get cash, so you can get the leverage. So there's more about where the opportunity to get the leverage is, and I think it's more sector based than probably geographical based.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nOn the PVA point, there are loads of different actual and potential changes in regulatory treatment that affect capital and I don't want us to get too locked into it. It's X basis points of -- because we could fill the rest of the Q&A session dealing with that. The point is we know that. We know that's coming. And what we're telling you is that we're going to get to 11% to 12%, and we're going to do it this year. On the last point?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrew Halford (Executives)】\nAnd to your last point, we have endeavored to actually make the press release a little bit more concise than last time, which has actually reduced it from about 150 to 100 pages, so there's a little less detail in that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nHe failed, actually. The target was 100 -- oh, it is 100 pages. Overnight, it's gone down from 101 to 100. Well done, well done.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrew Halford (Executives)】\nI knew what the question was coming from. The good news is that, when the ARA is published, you will be able to find out the answer to your question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nShould we take one more over the side? Ian?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ian Gordon (Analysts)】\nIt's Ian Gordon from Investec. I was just slightly surprised that your liability growth was as strong as it was in the second half, led by time deposits and, if I've read it correctly, led by the Americas and, to a lesser extent, Europe. Can you just explain the thinking behind that? And perhaps just wrap it into the comment on your interest rate, sensitivity to a rising interest rate environment if and when we get there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nWell, should I take the second part of that, first? And then Mike, you might want to talk about the dynamic driving deposit growth and particularly in the Americas. We are sensitive to interest rates as an institution. Rising interest rates is a good thing for Standard Chartered. Steeper yield curves are a good thing for Standard Chartered. It is impossible to be precise on the impact of them because you have to play out a scenario of a particular shape of the curve, and particular interest rates and how it is across different currencies. We have talked about in the past of shifts in interest rates being things that could drive our numbers by several hundred million dollars. These are not -- it is not a small driver of income for the bank. And it's been one of the things that has depressed returns, particularly impacting the economics of the Cash Management business and also retail deposits. Did you want to comment on the growth in deposits?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alun Rees (Executives)】\nYes. I mean one of the truths of banking is it's always good to be liquid and more and more liquid because it gives you optionality. So deposit-raising strategies with clients is a long-term thing which you don't pull the levers. You don't turn on and off. So just because assets are muted and the return you can get is muted, you don't stop the long-term haul of raising currency from retail, cash management deposits from corporates. That's a long-term gain. As you go into that, corporates -- why do people actually put deposits with you, they don't leave it in cars or/and overnight savings. They don't want to go into fixed and everything else. So you do get a change in the mix as you continue to go down that. So our deposit-raising strategy is a long-term strategy. And irrespective the asset side, we will continue on that because it is the right thing to do for sustainable growth of the bank. In particular, U.S. is a -- there's been a particular growth in deposits in the U.S., and that's a strange phenomenon, which is as we've rationalized our correspondent banking business, and Andy talked about a number of relationships, many people are doing as well. So what's happening is we're getting more business from fewer relationships. And so that's particularly coming through the Cash Management related to correspondent banking.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nOkay, more questions? Why don't we come over here [indiscernible]? Oh sorry, it's just somebody -- why don't -- in front, and then we'll come further back. And if we can keep them quite succinct, we'll try and keep our answers quite succinct because I'm conscious of time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Napier (Analysts)】\nIt's Jason from Deutsche Bank. 2 questions. First of all, on the cost of achieving the headline cost savings. Can you give us any guidance as to expectations around restructuring over the 3 years? You obviously know this year, I guess, in greater deal, so some sense as to what the capital drag from restructuring charges might be. And then secondly, just around the RWA release and efficiency program. From some of the numbers that you gave in the November slide deck, it appears that some of the higher-return product groups, if not relationships, are not delivering sort of what they're supposed to do, Principal Finance -- Corporate Finance is supposed to be where you get in with a CEO office and generate the much higher returns, at least that was my understanding of the group. And so I guess I'm trying to get a sense -- given the cost inflation that the firm faces, a lack of income is a problem. And so I wonder how you get to $25 billion as the lower bound; why the number isn't bigger, for example, such that you can aim for a higher ROE. That's a tricky one, but I guess the bottom line here is, if you really did have a blank piece of paper, would the new strategy not be more aggressive, more fundamentally different from where you are today?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nDo you want to pick up on the cost one?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrew Halford (Executives)】\nI was going to say, the first one, the answer is no. The second one, I -- listen, we've got 180 of restructuring costs in 2014. We are working on the programs that are going to head to the $1.8 billion. We do not have the details of exactly what the one-off costs are in order to get there. I mean, on the second one, I guess my point would be what we are trying to do clearly is to triangulate the capital return, increased return on equity and the funding of dividends. And it is a triangulation of those. It's not just the whole focus upon 1. We are trying to solve for all 3.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nAnd ultimately, you've got to look at it at the level of individual client relationships. And so you can't solve just for the Principal Finance aspect of the client relationship or the Corporate Finance aspect of it. And so the key is -- and this is why it does take a bit of time. It is client by client, looking at the overarching relationship. Sorry, I -- should we go on to -- behind you?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fahed Kunwar (Analysts)】\nIt's Fahed Kunwar speaking, from Redburn. My first question is on revenues. It's helpful guidance on the venue hit going forward, but on your ongoing business, it seems like a lot of your peers, including yourself, are pouring into the same kind of mass affluent kind of risk less -- or less-risky business. So the margins, which have come down in '14 again, did they keep on coming down considering the liquidity into those businesses? The next part of the question, I guess, is jaws has always been quite an important determinant for yourselves. When we think about -- or you haven't even mentioned it in the slide pack, so thinking of the ongoing business and the group business, I guess, are you still looking at kind of flat to positive jaws going forward? Or do -- have you kind of stopped looking at it through that way? The question then on credit quality as well: On your kind of performing loans, your Grade 12 category, the Corporate and Institutional Clients have gone kind of $1.5 billion to $4.5 billion. Is that part of the review that you did on the commodity exposure that you're talking about as a one-off thing? Or is there something ongoing underlying there? And the last bit is a clarification point. How is the E calculated on your ROE?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nI don't think we do anything particularly on ROE. It's a normalized ROE, and it's in the press release. You can derive it from the notes. On the more affluent point, look, the economics of retail banking are very clear that you'll make a disproportionate return on the more affluent customers relative to mass market customers, and that's not unique to us. That's something that I see across all retail banks. If you can pull the lever, relatively small shifts in the proportion of your income you get from what we call Priority customers can actually make a very material difference to your income, and we are making good progress on that. The income in Priority clients grew well, and it is driven a lot by non-balance-sheet items, particularly Wealth Management products and bancassurance. And you will see from the numbers that our bancassurance and Wealth Management income grew quite significantly. Do you want to pick up on the other questions, jaws, [indiscernible]?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrew Halford (Executives)】\nYes. I mean it's yes. The jaws one, we could have a long debate about. What we've decided is to go for hard numbers. We can target in the business hard numbers. And we can get programs together and deliver on hard numbers, and that's what we're going to do. And $1.8 billion over a 3-year period, it's going to be $400 million or $500 million a year. As you saw on the chart here, in 2014, that was a $200 million number, so actually, stepping up to $400 million, $500 million a year, it's going to be a big step-up. We're on track to do that in this year, and we will get there, but I prefer hard numbers. The other one, just on CG 12s and nonperforming, I mean, I suppose, if I sort of step back, the -- I suppose, 2 observations. One is that the nonperforming loans, compared with the first half, are up slightly, about $300 million; but the CG 12s, the worst category of performing, is actually $900 million lower than it was at the half year. And I think, therefore, one sort of needs to take both of those into account. And when one looks at the overall position, it's why we're sort of saying we're sort of okay where we're at. But I do think that the 2 together are probably the answer.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nI'm conscious of timing, and I don't want to keep people longer than they want to be, but there are a lot of questions still in the room. So we'll go for another sort of 10 minutes or so, if that's okay with people. I'll take another question from this side, Duncan, just whoever's nearest you. Sorry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chirantan Barua (Analysts)】\nChira from Bernstein. 2 quick questions. Peter, when it -- you put up that slide in terms of profit growth from when you became CEO here, one of the markets which helped you get there was India. We don't get too many questions out there. That's an economy in recovery. Can you give us a little brief about your franchise there? Is there fundamental things that are broken there and not being able to recover income? And the second thing was on Principal Finance, again, Andy, to your risk diagnosis. So how much capital is tied up in the business? What does the business actually represent? I saw that you have some gains in Q4? So how should we think about the business going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nSome combination of the 2. You can tackle the Principal Finance. On India, good question. India was a powerful driver of profit growth for us in earlier years in my tenure. And then at the time, actually, where India went through a difficult couple of years, it was a difficult couple of years for us too, and our profits in India fell quite sharply. I think we are now in a -- like India, we are India itself. We are in a process of transition, where there are some very encouraging signs. We have a government that is much more dynamic in terms of reform. We have a central bank governor who is, as recent immediate events suggest, is very actively managing the monetary situation within the economy. We see all those as very, very positive signs. However, there is quite a sort of overhang of the paralysis that affected India over the last couple of years. So we -- I -- we see this as a sort of transitional phase for both the economy and for our business in India. However, over the medium-term, we remain extremely positive. We have a very, very strong franchise there. There's nothing sort of broken about it at all. It's a very strong client franchise, and we are very positive over the medium term over India's prospects.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alun Rees (Executives)】\nOn the Principal Finance one, it goes back to a previous question as well. On Principal Finance, the economics of that business are attractive on a standalone basis, but what you don't see, which was the previous question, is the leverage it gives us with the clients. But that's not in Principal Finance. That comes out in terms of Cash Management, FX. And the leverage we get is very significant, but that's in the broader relationship and it comes back to Peter's point. So assets at work [ph] amount to about $2.3 billion in Principal Finance, and the leverage that gives us with our clients on a client basis is very significant and very significantly higher than the product -- the economics of the product, which in and of itself are already attractive. The other thing is you'll notice our Principal Finance assets are down year-on-year because that gives us another opportunity in terms of repackaging that. And Peter talked earlier about the importance of the growth of our institutional investor segment, so we give it an opportunity there for good assets which we can create so it -- the leverage it gives us is more than just standing alone looking at the individual product economics.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nOkay, in this side, should we take a -- who's got a mic? Where is the mic? Oh, sorry, you've got it. Why don't we take this one? And then we'll come over to this side. Can I limit people to one question a person? Because -- as a discipline?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrew Halford (Executives)】\nIt's hard to...\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Peace (Executives)】\nYou could limit to one answer...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nWe could limit it by giving one answer, right. Yes, that's a good idea.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nPeter, it's [indiscernible]. I'll keep it to one question. I just -- did you have a methodological change in the way you calculate NPLs in Africa? Because if I look at the, say, for the first half for 2014, they're now on Page 51, $471 million of gross NPLs. And in your last report for the half year, they were $966 million. And there hasn't been a big change in the loan balance, so I was just wondering if there was a methodology change or if something came out of NPLs that was significant. Because it is a big -- it's about a $495 million drop down.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nYes, yes, [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrew Halford (Executives)】\nYes, they've been put on a financial basis. We'll even explain that to you afterwards, but they're now on an equivalent basis.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nThe actual aggregate NPLs hasn't changed. We just moved it. Okay.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nIt's Ligor Drin [ph] from Royal Bank of Canada. I was going to ask you about AT1s in your statement, but as I can only ask one question, I would be interested to know whether you're going to quantify that for us, though. So are they...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nThat's a very sly way of doing it, isn't it? What is your question?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nActually, my question was more like -- my question is on dividends. And I wasn't quite sure what you're saying your strategy on dividends is. It feels like it's sort of the $0.86 is something you're either putting there as a holding pattern until you've had a new Chief Executive that has a look at it, or you're actually saying we're going to grow into that and from there be progressive. I wonder whether you could just clarify what the new dividend strategy is, if there is a new one.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nWell, I think the thing we would say is we are acutely conscious of the importance of dividends to our shareholders, the important role it plays in the value our shareholders get from investing in Standard Chartered. And we are also managing our capital ratios very assertively, and we have set out a very clear target. Doing stuff with the dividend is not the first port of call because of the importance of it to our shareholders. And we are using the levers that we can control to get to where we want to get to on the capital ratio. I don't know if you wanted to add more on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Peace (Executives)】\nI think it's very important. And that's why, again today, we're talking about trajectory on our capital, on our Common Equity Tier 1 capital. And we're confident of getting between 11% and 12%. And so as Peter said, we have then levers we can pull, and the board could choose which priorities and which levers to pull at any time.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nOkay, Chris?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Manners (Analysts)】\nIt's Chris Manners from Morgan Stanley. One question it is, then. So I was looking at your ROE target of just over 10% in the medium term. And I remember, at the half year results, you did explain there is actually really good revenue growth opportunities. I think you put up a slide from McKinsey showing maybe 10% compound annual growth rate in banking revenue pools in the markets that you're in over the next sort of 5 years or so. If you're only to do 10% ROE, presumably you can only grow TNAV by 10%, only grow RWAs by 10% and then basically manage to grow revenues in line with the revenue pool if you pay out 0. Or how do you make a payout...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nWe're not saying we're limiting ourselves to a 10% ROE, but given that -- your maths is fine, but given that we are below a 10% ROE, to set a number that is significantly higher would seem not sensible at this point. Our first priority is to get ourselves to a 10% ROE, and then we'll worry about the pace of growth and stuff thereafter. Sandy? And then I -- if we could make this the last question, I think, because otherwise I think we really will overrun. Yes? Pressure's on, it's got to be a good question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sandy Chen (Analysts)】\nAll right, okay. Yes. $10 billion in costs, 2/3 of that in staffing. The -- I was wondering if you could cut it, no pun intended, along staffing lines between the sort of country-based people and sort of business-based versus back-office side. And where I'm getting at is that kind of that I've looked at you guys as long as you've been sitting there, and it always struck me that sort of a lot of the problems seem to come from the country side versus the sort of business side of Standard Chartered. So if you do focus a lot of the headcount reductions and cost reductions on the country-based management structure, might there be an upside in terms of lower regulatory charges as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nThe reality is we run a matrix, and we have some businesses that globally are more efficient than others, and we have some geographies that, for any given business, are more or less efficient than others, so there is a -- both a geographic and a business line dimension to the efficiency equation. So for example, our Korea business in retail is not nearly as efficient as we would like. We've been taking assertive action on that. The number of branches is down by something like 60 or so, and we've been reducing the headcount. But also, if I look at retail globally, we think it has a cost-income ratio that is just simply too high, and that's on a global basis. So we are looking at efficiency. And frankly, to deliver the $1.8 billion, we have to do this. We are looking at it both ways. So it's not a question of saying we're going to take a country perspective or a business perspective. We're going to take a look at every perspective. And the other thing we are doing is we are looking very hard at the processes which cut across different client segments and parts of the bank and saying, \"Let's try and standardize and optimize those as far as possible,\" so we minimize having different processes doing roughly the same thing or duplication around the institution. So this is...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sandy Chen (Analysts)】\nThat was more my point, yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nThere's stuff to go for. And as I said earlier, the trick to doing all of this is technology. It's very difficult to -- there are some opportunities where you can actually stop doing something, but most of the time, the opportunity is to do it in a way that is much more efficient. And if you can take people out of the equation, that's the most powerful way of making it more efficient.\r\nI think we have run out of time. I don't know, John, whether you wanted to make any closing comments?\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Peace (Executives)】\nVery briefly.\r\nStandard Chartered is a very good bank. It's going through a transition. It's going through change. And I hope what we've been able to do today is give you the confidence that we really have been listening to our shareholders. We really are taking action to refresh the strategy and get the bank in very good shape for the future. And although 2014 was disappointing, we still think the future and the emerging markets, some very exciting markets, in the world offer great opportunities for this bank.\r\nAnd thank you, all, for coming today.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Peter Sands (Executives)】\nYes, thank you very much.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Andrew Halford (Executives)】\nYes, thank you.",

      "transcript_text1": "Good morning, and thank you for coming to our investor presentation this morning. You will have seen the announcement we made this morning alongside our annual results for 2014 and the announcement made by Crédit Suisse. \r\nOf course, the board is sorry to lose Tidjane as Group CEO but understands his desire to take on a new challenge in a new environment after 7 very successful years at Prudential. He made -- he's made an outstanding contribution to the success of this group in recent years, and that can be seen in today's results. \r\nWe are fortunate to have a strong management team beyond Tidjane. The board also has a rigorous succession planning process, and that is now being implemented. We believe we'll be in a position to announce the name of the new CEO very shortly. You will, of course, be aware that the appointment is subject to regulatory approval. \r\nThat's all I'm going to say. I'm going to pass over to Tidjane. Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you, Paul. Good morning to all of you. Thank you for being here. \r\nThose of you who know me know that I will not miss an opportunity to point out that I am -- today's kind of a tale [ph] event because we have a day after Arsenal beat Man U at Old Trafford. So that this mean in the -- yes, thank you, particularly good mood. So -- it doesn't happen very often. So anyway, again, good morning. \r\nWe've had a broad-based performance in 2014, a really good year. And if you look back to what we said in 2010, Growth and Cash, I believe it's the fifth consecutive year where we have delivered on both commitments. So what I intend to do is -- in my section is to give you the highlights of our financial performance in 2014. I will also cover kind of a usual BU-by-BU overview, then Nic will take you through the financials, and I will come back towards the end for the outlook before we move to Q&A.\r\nSo if we begin with 2014 and the performance, you've seen the numbers this morning. We have made good progress across our key metrics. And if you start with growth in IFRS profits, IFRS profits are up 14% and very fundamentally, over 5 years, doubled for the group as a whole but also doubled for each of Asia, M&G and Jackson, which is really underlying, this was good performance. \r\nNew business profit, which is something we've always looked at more closely when AP is up 10% at GBP 2,126 million. And we are satisfied with this number given the low interest rate environment, and the interest rate's -- long-term interest rate is going down in 2014. And also, as you know, the fact that in Jackson, we have a sales cap, a self-imposed sales cap. So in that context, to grow at 10% is very pleasing. \r\nAnd the third thing we've encouraged you to follow and judge us on is really cash for free surplus generation, which is part of our 2017 objectives and which is up 9% at GBP 2.5 billion. It's a number I'll come back to from its fundamental that this group in the way it operates generate in excess of GBP 2 billion every year. And that is core to our strategy. \r\nAnd finally, we've been able to increase tangible returns for shareholders. By that, I mean the dividend, which is rebased upwards by 10% to be at 36.93p. That said, we reiterate that our dividend policy hasn't changed, so we'll come back to it in Q&A, but it's always the same. And this rebase has also been decided by the board because of the strong operating and financial performance of the group. \r\nAnd if we move to capital, whether it's on the -- almost in its last year the old regime, the IGD regime, we have a cover of 2.4x at GBP 4.7 billion, after a number of Jewish IGD costly moves in 2014 that Nic will come back to from the SCB deal to repaying the hybrid debt. And on an economic basis, on the same basis we presented it last year, we're on 218% solvency from 257%. \r\nWe believe that these numbers are the translation of our strategy, which has been unchanged. We've heard -- you've heard us say the same things for a number of years, and we believe this strategy is robust, works across the cycle and delivers good result. And '14 is a good illustration of that because if you look at the backdrop of 2014, it hasn't been without its challenges. And pretty certainly, in my years here, I don't remember a quiet year. And we can go around the globe, from challenges in Asia, from the Umbrella Movement, the Hong Kong protests, which worried a lot of you, the coup in Thailand, Indonesia, we were referring at the beginning of the year the election that had a huge impact on consumer confidence in Indonesia. You have the FX depreciation across the board in excess of 20%. \r\nThese are very significant market moves. You've had in Europe, closer to us here, everybody has kind of forgotten it, but the Scottish independence vote and the uncertainty induced by that. You've had the budget reform and the disruption to the annuity market. And you have more global trends or phenomena, such as the commodity price volume fall or the oil price fall, which has an impact in the markets we operate in, the question of the normalization of the U.S. monetary policy with the end of QE3 or in Europe, in the eurozone, a new QE and lower interest rates in their fight against deflation or the threat of deflations and, as we said, regulate it to avoid an embedding in the expectations of deflation. \r\nSo it was not an easy year, and this makes us reasonably happy with the numbers we have been able to deliver. Our job as management is to try and deliver for our shareholders good results even against headwinds. \r\nAnd if you look at the progression by BU in '14, you see that Asia IFRS is up 17%, and 8 of 11 business units in Asia had double-digit growth in IFRS profits. If you look at the U.S., it's again a really bright spot with a record remittance, USD 680 million or GBP 415 million. To put this in context, in 2006, the total remittances from all the businesses in the U.K. -- sorry, into Prudential, the U.K. into the center, are GBP 99 million. So that gives you a sense of the scale of the transformation and the performance of Jackson there. \r\nSo '14 was 45% up on '13, and '13 was 17.5% up on '12. So it's been really over 3 years of very, very strong progression. And we -- you know that we believe that the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and cash is the ultimate measure of everything we do. And by that metric, we've done very well. \r\nIf you look closer to home here in the U.K., PruFund, which is really our with-profit product, a very strong progression in 2014, plus 27% in funds under management to reach almost GBP 12 billion, GBP 11.6 billion for a single fund in the retail U.K. market, that's an amazing performance. And M&G up 13% in profits at GBP 446 million for M&G. Again, if you look back a few years ago, you'll see that the entire Prudential used to make GBP 600 million or GBP 700 million a year. So M&G has become almost as big as Pru used to be. \r\nSo this validates, we believe, our strategy. And I think it's the illustration that the strategy we've put in place works. One thing we've talked to you about for many, many years, I remember, when we started doing this, there was just one bar in 2008, the first time we did this disclosure, which is the sources of earnings. And we've told you that we would work hard to de-correlate to the extent possible our earnings from interest rates, and that's what we've done. For the emphasis on fee income, the emphasis on insurance income, the sum of the 2 have gone from about 50% of the initial or in total to 74% today. And the total bar has more than doubled in the process, so a CAGR of 19% over 8 years from the 2 together is very, very significant. And it has really transformed the nature of our earnings. \r\nWe don't really like spread income because we think that it is risky, often underlying better products with interest rate guarantees and guaranteed returns. It's capital-intensive, and it's very exposed to economic cycle and the interest rate cycle, and we deemphasize it. \r\nAnd actually, when we write that type of business, as you know, we tend to put it in the with-profit fund where we have a comfortable capital buffer. So this is really underlying if you have a valuation multiple, spread income is on a relatively low multiple. And a lot of the re-rating of the stock has been in the ability to deliver this profit and this change in profile, which makes us, we believe, quite different from most companies in the sector, which have anywhere from 50% to 80% of their earnings from spread income. \r\nAnd it's -- the lucky part is that we've done that at the time when interest rates went to one of the lowest points ever. So it certainly has increased the distance between us and others. But it's really this consistency in the direction of the journey and in performance that's brought our confidence that we are going to achieve our 2017 objectives. Showing about it as a 10 half-year period, we've done 4. So we're not even halfway, but we think that we are tracking well, and it's encouraging.\r\nSo moving on to something I know which is on your mind, which is really capital and solvency. The first I'm going to have to say is that the first source of capital in business is to operate profitably and in a cash-generative manner. All our efforts in terms of running the company with a strategy for business model is to make sure that we deliver every year positive cash generation, I said GBP 2.5 billion in 2014. \r\nWe actually believe that, that will allow us to grow our way out of any capital challenge because when you're progressing and -- at that pace, and again, Nic will give you more color on that, you can't really get in a insolvency trouble. And we believe that whatever lens you adopt for solvency, that strength will come through. \r\nCash is cash is cash is capital, and that's right. So we have designed the model, and that's why we're so reluctant about it and quite confident because we know we can operate at that level and think that there's plenty of upside there, which is with interest rates, long-term interest rates at a very, very low level, we can generate GBP 2.5 billion of cash.\r\nSo Solvency II is an interesting measure. You know that we have had reservations about it. We have always been very clear about what they are. Essentially, 2. One is around market consistency as a way to assess assets and liabilities across the economic cycle. We do not think it works. I think we were vindicated in '08, '09. We don't think it works at all times in the cycle. There are moments where it's fine, but there are moments where it's not. And the other one is really 1 year of value at risk, which we believe is incorrect because insurance companies are resolved as their liabilities come due. And that's not 1 year. And the 1 year metric, which is of the banking origin, is inappropriate and inadequate in the case of long-term liabilities like we have in the life sector. \r\nSo what are the structural deficiencies of the framework? And you see that a lot of the discussion in lobbying has been actually on mitigating that, all right, either through countercylical buffers or it's matching the adjustment [ph] of others, it's to mitigate at the extreme of the cycle the impact of that approach. \r\nSo accepting that, we're also very pragmatic even if we are not convinced that it's the right way to look at it. It is going to be implemented on January 1, 2016, so we do not have a choice. But we believe, even taking into account that there are still some areas under discussion with the regulator, and I have to stress it's a positive and a constructive dialogue. We're very happy with the engagement we have with the regulator on that. And there are mainly 2 issues there. One is around the recognition of the Asian surpluses. We are a very Asian company. We produce very significant material surpluses in Asia, and the regulator must make a determination on how much of a surplus it is going to recognize. \r\nOur view on that, again, from an economic value perspective, is that those surpluses exist, okay, in absolute terms, and they belong 100% to a shareholder. The debate on how much of it is recognized here in London is not economic, and it won't change the economic reality. So we have said that there is a discussion on that. But we're saying it doesn't affect the underlying economics. Those surpluses are sitting where we are sitting, and they are occurring to the shareholder for the share price. You can see it in the share price. You can see it in the valuation of our Asian business. Those surpluses are real. And we have discussions on the calibration really of things like credit and longevity, and they're ongoing. \r\nBut the message, the key takeaway on that is we're running a highly capital-generative strategy and business model, and we think that the result will be manageable. That's the word we want to put to you, manageable, i.e., without major consequences on the way we run the group strategy or our ability to reward our shareholders. And Nic will come back to that and give you the sensitivities with more numbers. \r\nSo that's all I wanted to say at the group level. So if we move to the business units. So we have a chart that you've seen. Over here is a quarter-by-quarter. Sales in Asia, again, when we started it, it was -- there weren't many bars. We now have quite a few. We've had 20 quarters of growth above 16% in Asia. That's 5 years. And to us, that's really the power of the story. And it illustrates very much the power of the platform and the diversification we have in Asia because if we wanted to make a very busy chart, we could have put all the challenges we've had over the years, from the Indian market in 2010, from trends in Korea, from Indonesia this year. I don't remember in my time in the company a quiet year in Asia, and Barry and his team have been able to deliver for you a straight line through that. \r\nAnd really that's just diversification and the quality of the platform and the quality of the distribution force, which has allowed us, if you look at the numbers, to double basically the sales between '09 and '14, and the profits in the same period are effectively more than doubled.\r\nFocusing on Q4. You can see the size of that bar. We've seen a very strong rebound in our numbers in Q4 in Asia, and I think that came through in the results you saw this morning. And I'd like to give you a bit of color on how it happened, looking at some of our key markets. \r\nStarting with Hong Kong. Remember, many discussions about Hong Kong being a mature market, where it was up 39% for us this year year-on-year. And more pleasing inside that is that H&P has taken off, health and protection. It's something we've always wanted to do. You know that  our profile in Hong Kong is very effective. In fact, we have a with-profit fund. Profit immersion is slow, and we always had as an ambition to inject more health and protection in there with -- Barry has launched 2 products: PRUmyhealth crisis multi-care and PRUmyhealth crisis lifelong care, which have been very successful. And actually, H&P sales were up 56% year-on-year in Hong Kong. \r\nWhen you see the size of Hong Kong, it's actually our largest business. To grow your largest business by 39% and 56% is quite an achievement. \r\nSingapore, we have a very large business in Asia. It did well. Agency APE is up 16%. You know that actually, the market grew less than that, so we've gained market share in Singapore. And within that, SCB had a very good year also, up 12%. So we're, again, pleased with the performance in Singapore, which is growing very nicely in double digits and very profitable. \r\nAnd Indonesia, always a lot of focus on that country. We have told you things as they were as the year unfolded, Q1, Q2, Q3. Q4 was very strong. Q4 was up 53% on Q3. And we see absolutely Indonesia returning to growth. And I'm sure we'll have a chance to talk about it at Q1 in May that we're confident. \r\nSo those are the 3 biggest units. But we also have a range of smaller units that are coming up. China, China has made it on this chart because growth at 30% per annum for a number of years will take you to a good place. IFRS was up 30%. APE was up 35%. And again, here, the H&P, health and protection, theme is there, with health and protection, very helpful to our bottom line, up 43% in China. \r\nThe interesting thing about China is we disclosed only our 49% holding. If you put China on the 100% basis, it's my pleasure to tell you that China is now our fourth largest business in Asia. So that's taken over Malaysia. It's a major development for us, and it's continuing to grow very, very strongly. So the patience, I think, we have displayed there by not selling down and continuing is starting to pay off to have a material presence in our scale in China. And that's going to continue to grow.\r\nThe Philippines is kind of our little darling in the region. You know that. It's a great economy. Over the next 3 years, we have the best expected economic growth, GDP growth in Asia. Earnings up 75%, and we focused on growing our regular premium in health and protection sales in that market before it's too low. 30% up regular premiums, with great promise of future profits, and health and protection up 36% again. \r\nAnd finally, Thailand. We had our first full year with Thanachart, so 12 months with Thanachart. APE is up 36%, and IFRS earnings up 10%. \r\nSo we see the first division doing very well, and the second division below, smaller but growing faster and catching up. And we always believe that in the end, they're all going to end up in first division, we hope. \r\nMaybe just to resume on SCB because it's a topic of interest. We spend shareholder money to get that distribution. So it's very important for us that we produce the returns. And the year-on-year progression, second half-to-second half, '13, '14, is 33%. And that is really broad-based, very strong performance in Hong Kong and elsewhere in Asia. The new markets we activated, so when we talk about activating, we see this as a new relationship. We're very, very pleased with this progression. \r\nBut Asia is not just life, although I have said [indiscernible] here is about the life. We said it's also Eastspring, and Eastspring has had simply its best year ever. GBP 5.4 billion of net flows, external net flows. That's almost on the scale of M&G. It's remarkable. And you see the funds under management going up 28%, GBP 77 billion. And behind that, we have profit going up 32% to a very -- getting close to GBP 100 million, which is kind of material for our business we've built over many years and started from over -- from nothing. Actually, Eastspring is now the largest onshore retail asset manager in Asia, and we're quite proud of that. And again, Barry, Guy and the team have done a great job on this. \r\nNow what I say on the scenario, don't get carried away. We know it's a cyclical and volatile business, and it's very much driven by market. So we always have a word of caution there against projecting those trends as they are, but it's still a very, very pleasing result. \r\nSo if you look at Asia as a whole, again, IFRS profit is now -- it's comfortably above GBP 1 billion, GBP 1.1 billion. Again, a few years ago, the group was making GBP 600 million or GBP 700 million as a whole. So that's again a remarkable transformation of Asia, and cash-generative, with almost GBP 600 million of cash, if I remember, in '92, up 15%, so a really good year. \r\nStrong delivery in 2014 in Asia in a challenging context. I'll remind you all these numbers were produced against all the headwinds we talked about in the region last year. Disciplined execution by the team, high-quality Pan-Asian platform, and we believe the business remain well positioned to deliver long-term, high-quality, profitable growth.\r\n \r\nSo moving on to the U.S. Now I'll go back to a chart we've been using now for 12 years, but a good thing is that we're building more data points. The evolution of the VA sales in the U.S. has been nothing short of remarkable, very, very strong. We went from kind of $6 billion 6 years ago to about $23 billion this year. \r\nBut the true story is inside those numbers. If you look at the gray chart, which should come first, these are the GMWB, so the VAs with living benefits. We keep emphasizing that actually since '11, they have been flat but deliberate, moving up and down, USD 15.1 billion in '14, but this is a point on which we're a bit sensitive. We believe that we're controlling that volume of sales. Mike and his team are well in control of that. They are very corrective about it. We have a budget every year, and we deliver on that budget, and we think that is absolutely supported by the data. \r\nBut we have an interest on that. We've been innovative. They created Elite Access. Elite Access, $5.1 billion this year of sales. Since it started 3 years ago, we sold now $10 billion of this product. And I say it might have created a market because it's -- actually in VAs, it's the #4 product on a stand-alone basis across the U.S. market. Elite Access alone, that is a commercial success. That is a testament of the product development skills and the distribution power that Jackson has. And finally, you have the VA's result, any living benefits that are in dark blue. \r\nSo we've been able to prove this trick of combining a controlled risk consumption with a continued increase in the top line. And that's what drives the economic performance of a business. And if you look at the nonliving benefit VAs, they've gone from 11% 3 years ago to 34% now. That's a very, very good development. It's also as a whole a more capital-efficient mix, and you will see that when Nic talks about the new business stream.\r\nSo low interest rates, of course, is always a discussion. So we've given you the U.S. 10-year treasury yield here in blue, and we've put that against the fee income. And again, there, if you look at the '06 numbers, GBP 177 million of fee income, GBP 1.4 billion this year. It's a remarkable performance, and the fact that we have driven both the volume and the product characteristics to generate this type of profitability in the low interest rate environment, it's one of the things that give us confidence that this is a robust business model that can survive and do well across the cycle. \r\nAnd no better proof of that than my favorite chart, the cash remittances from Jackson. There's nowhere to hide. At the end of the day, we've told you judge us on the cash generation. These transfers have been made with a strong RBC. We're at 450%, 456% at the end of the year, 450%, and $680 million of transfer. I don't have anything to add to that. It's a remarkable performance. \r\nMoving on to the U.K. Jackie and the team have had a challenging year. You've seen what happened in the market with the budget announcement. So in that context, we are really pleased with the performance. IFRS profit, up 7%, and we're putting gray there with in-force because it's obvious and you all know it. But to just repeat the importance of in-force in the profitability of a company like ours, yes, there is a lot of focus on new business. And that's what Tidjane [ph] has commented upon, that really, most of the value is emerging with in-force. And the business is very good at doing that. And that only happens as a result of good discipline, cost discipline, express management, lapse management. That's what drives these numbers, so we're very pleased with that GBP 614 million. \r\nAnd at the top, you see what happened, the decrease in the retail entities' profitability from GBP 110 million to GBP 57 million, and the very strong activity we've had in bulks. And I will again insist one didn't drive the other. This was just a very good year for bulks. If the conditions for writing profitable business had not been there, we would not have written that business. We didn't write it to make up for the fall in annuities. We wrote it because there's very strong demand for bulks. \r\nJackie has one of the best teams in the market. And there are customers who will pay a premium for the safety of Prudential and for the name of Prudential. And that's where we like to play in the very big schemes, where we understand the value we are buying and are willing to pay a premium price that then meets our hurdle rates in terms of capital allocation and deal and trade with us. So it's been a really good story. \r\nThe other bright spot really in the U.K. is the with-profit. I know we keep surprising by talking up the with-profit, but we have no reason not to talk it up. If you look at the -- what does it do? It delivers controlled volatility and returns. That's that red curve. And that red curve is against the fund comparator that's relevant, and you can see the outperformance. We've outperformed the FTSE. \r\nAnd of course, investment performance in the retail market drive net flows. The net flows have been very, very strong. We were just 2 years before at GBP 7.5 billion. We're at GBP 11.6 billion. We did plus 21%, followed by plus 27%. \r\nAnd this is where we think actually the reform is driving increased savings. We think that is linked to the environment where consumers are actually incentivized to save more. And we have a great engine, a great vehicle for the savings that we wrap in different wrappers. But fundamentally, it delivers good investment performance and therefore attracts flows. So that's part of our answer to the regulatory change for which we're preparing in the U.K. \r\nIf you look at the retirement phase, we've been able to come up with a drawdown. That's been launched in December very successfully. We're also developing a more flexible investment product, giving more choice to investors. It is doing very well. \r\nIf you move to the savings space, we told you we would develop a proof on ISA, so good growing profit in an ISA that has been done. And the indications I have from the business is that the applications are very, very strong, ahead of April 6. We're only going to put it through after April 6, and it's very strong, very strong pipeline, and Jackie can give you more color on that. \r\nSo stronger presence in the retirement space, better savings offering and stronger distribution. We have now developed a bond that can go on platforms, and we are actively promoting it to put it on more platforms. And that also contributes to the increase in sales. But if you look at the proof on the increase, quite a bit of that is increased distribution. We just have been able to put more products on the shelves of more distributors with very good results.\r\nSo the U.K. for us is always -- UK Life but also M&G. If you look at M&G, this chart is familiar. If you look at the -- in red, it's the external funds under management. We went from GBP 70 billion in 2009 to GBP 137 billion in 2014, so it's more than doubled. And in the same time, Michael and his team have grown profits. You can see on the next slide the progression in IFRS profit. We have more than doubled between '09 and '14 to arrive above GBP 400 million. \r\nSo bringing all of these together, and I just want to look at our 3 usual metrics: IFRS, NBP and cash. But at the group level, we are pleased with this performance. It's been over a long period of time, I think, which is really the main thing, because it's -- especially the 1 or 2 years, but this is -- now can be called a long track record of very strong performance. Profits have trebled since 2006. IFRS went from GBP 1 billion to GBP 3 billion. And we insist together the consistency of the strategy. We've been quite boringly telling you about the same things, and I'm afraid we will continue to do so. \r\nNew business profit, same thing, more than 3x increase between '06 and 2014. And finally, free surplus generation, which we have really emphasized, the cash generation, from kind of GBP 0.5 billion to GBP 2.5 billion, which we believe is a very natural evolution because you start with NBP, goes into IFRS, goes into cash if you are disciplined and if you execute well, which is what we believe we have done. \r\nSo with this, I'm going to stop, and I'm going to let Nic take you through the financials.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you, Tidjane, and good morning, everyone. \r\nIn my presentation, I will provide you with a detailed look at the drivers of our performance in 2015 and give you an update on our capital position and on our balance sheet.\r\nSo starting with the -- can we go back? Starting with the financial headlines. The group delivered a strong performance in 2014, with good progress across all of our key Growth and Cash financial measures. We achieved this against the backdrop of lower global yields and continued volatility in currency markets. \r\nOperationally, we faced a number of country-specific challenges in Asia and unprecedented levels of regulatory change in the U.K. life market. Despite these headwinds and after allowing for the currency translation effect, IFRS operating profit increased by 14% to GBP 3.2 billion. Free surplus generation was up 9% to GBP 2.6 billion. Post-tax new business profit rose 10% to GBP 2.1 billion. And embedded value operating profit, also on a post-tax basis, rose by 4% at GBP 4.1 billion. \r\nBoth new business profit and EEV operating profit were adversely impacted by the decline in yield. Absent which, the year-on-year improvement in these performance metrics would have been 14% for NBP and 11% for EEV total.\r\nForeign exchange has been a feature in our headline results during 2014 when reporting the performance of those businesses that generate earnings in U.S. dollars or in various Asian currencies. Collectively, this business has now produced most of our earnings. The effect of reporting these overseas results using the stronger average sterling rate during 2014 is shown in the red bars on the right. \r\nAs we have said before, this effect is purely translational because, in all cases, we run local currency businesses where assets and liabilities are currency-matched, and we have no transactional cross-currency exposures. So in line with the approach that I adopted at the interims and for the purposes of today's presentation, I have reexpressed the 2013 comparatives on a constant exchange rate basis. \r\nThis slide summarizes the effect of this retranslation on the 4 financial metrics that I'm about to cover, with the impact coming from Jackson shown in dark blue and that coming from Asia in light blue. With this covered, we can now focus on the underlying drivers of our performance.\r\nTurning to the contribution of our 4 businesses for -- to each financial metric. You can see on this slide that the improvement in performance was broad-based. Asia delivered an excellent trading performance, with strong growth across all measures, particularly IFRS operating profit and free surplus generation, the 2 metrics that form part of our 2017 financial objectives. \r\nIn the U.S., the benefits of our disciplined approach to managing the balance between growth, risk and capital were evident in the strong improvement in the IFRS operating profit and free surplus generation. The 2 EEV-based metrics also improved despite the self-imposed sales cap on certain products and the drag from lower U.S. treasury rates. In a year of considerable market disruption, our UK Life business delivered a resilient performance, achieving the highest levels of new business in IFRS operating profit since the 2008 financial crisis. \r\nFinally, M&G reached new highs for both funds under management and IFRS profit. \r\nSo this 2014 broad-based delivery demonstrates Prudential's ongoing ability to generate both Growth and Cash, a distinctive feature within our industry. \r\nI would now like to look at each financial measure in more detail. \r\nStarting with IFRS. Total operating profit increased by 14% to GBP 3,186 million, which represents a 26% return on equity. As you can see on the right, most of this increase came from our preferred sources of fee income and insurance or technical income. The rise in fee income was driven by growth in Jackson's separate account balances as well as the increase in funds managed by M&G and Eastspring. The improvement in technical income reflected another year of strong health and protection growth in Asia and a higher contribution from REALIC. \r\nSpread income grew at a more modest rate as we seek to reduce the weight of this interest rate-sensitive source. Operating costs have also increased but at a lower run rate than total income, demonstrating once again the operational leverage in our business. So in 2014, we increased both the scale and the quality of our IFRS operating profit.\r\nTurning to the IFRS results for each business and starting with Asia. Our overall profit was up 17%, with strong underlying performances in both life and asset management. Our life profits of GBP 1,050 million reflected the increase in the scale of our operations across the region and our focus on regular premium protection-oriented solutions that address the needs of Asia's growing middle class. \r\nWe measure the scale of our business by reference to policyholder liabilities, which, as you can see in the top right-hand box, increased by 20% to GBP 26.4 billion as we added another cohort of regular premium new business. As a result, total income across the region grew by 10%, which outpaced the 6% increase in costs. \r\nSo the dynamic that we have talked about before of adding high-quality new regular premium business to a large, profitable and sticky existing book, all processed through a scalable platform, remains a powerful underpin of our earnings momentum in Asia. \r\nIn 2014, Eastspring attracted a record GBP 10.4 billion of third party- and internal-led flows, which together with positive market movements, drove assets under management to a new high of GBP 77 billion. Fee income increased by 20%, in line with the growth in average AUM. And with costs rising at a slower rate, the overall IFRS profit was 32% higher at GBP 90 million.\r\nIn the U.S., IFRS profit was up strongly at GBP 1,443 million, driven by a 21% increase in Jackson's life result. The improvements in Jackson's profitability has been accompanied by a positive evolution in the sources of earnings, with fee and technical income growing strongly, as shown in the chart in the top right. \r\nSpread income is only marginally up on last year, with reductions in crediting rates broadly matching the declines -- the decline in yield. As the headroom between current and guaranteed crediting rate levels is now small, a lower-for-longer interest rate scenario will see spread margin decline towards the 200 basis point level in the next 2 or 3 years. \r\nTechnical income benefited from an increased contribution from REALIC of GBP 216 million, up from GBP 178 million in the previous year. REALIC is now equivalent to 1/3 of the technical income block shown in blue.\r\nJackson's fastest-growing source was fee income, driven by the growth in separate account balances, which is illustrated in the chart in the bottom right. As you can see, the increase to $127 billion was mainly due to $12 billion of business inflows. Elite Access contributed $5 billion of this $12 billion and represented just over 8% of the separate account assets at the end of 2014. \r\nFinally, the profit from other U.S. operations is lower at GBP 12 million, reflecting the fee refunds in Curian, which we covered at the interims. \r\nTurning to the U.K. The improved performance was driven by the life result, which increased by 7% to GBP 752 million. This result was underpinned by a resilient contribution from our 2 core sources of with-profits and in-force annuities, which were not impacted by the U.K. market reforms.\r\nAlongside the rest of the market, sales of new individual annuities declined, reducing their contribution to profits from GBP 110 million to GBP 57 million. Bulks written on attractive economics added GBP 105 million to the total. We remain selective in our approach to the bulk annuity market, and we will only write the business where returns are sufficiently attractive. \r\nSo as we move forward, we think about the profitability of our UK Life business in 3 blocks. The first relates to the season and relatively stable results from with-profits and in-force annuities. The second relates to the contribution from new individual annuity business whose size will ultimately depend on how consumer demand for this product develops after April this year. And the third represents the profit from bulks, which will vary depending on the ongoing availability of sufficiently attractive deals.\r\nStaying in the U.K. and turning to M&G. IFRS operating profit was 13% higher at GBP 446 million, reflecting the growing scale of the business. As you can see in the box in the bottom right, assets under management increased to GBP 264 billion, driven by strong inflows and positive market movements. Within this total, retail AUM grew faster at 11%, reflecting M&G's success in Europe where it secured record net inflows of GBP 8.1 billion in 2014. \r\nThe higher overall level of AUM and the positive shift in business mix towards retail drove an 11% increase in fee income, which you can see in the box in the top right. \r\nM&G continues to invest in people and infrastructure to support the growth that we have seen in recent years. In 2014, the rising costs was outpaced by the higher level of fee revenues, driving a small improvement in the cost/income ratio to 58%. The rate of investment will continue for the foreseeable future, which will mean that this ratio could rise in the coming years.\r\nI will now move to free surplus, the primary measure of cash generation of our business. As you can see on the left, free surplus generation after investment in new business increased by 9% to GBP 2,579 million. The key component of this was the return from life in-force book, which was 19% higher at GBP 2,276 million. \r\nThis strong increase reflects the dynamic of adding another cohort of high-return, fast-payback new business on an already sizable back book. The GBP 314 million positive experience result reflected our ongoing success in managing the existing business for value. As I said last year, the comparative benefited from higher assumption changes, producing a result which was well above the run rate that we typically achieve. \r\nIn the top right, you can see that all 3 businesses are making significant contributions to the life in-force total, with a strong uplift in both Asia and Jackson where the high-return, fast-payback dynamic is most evident. The U.K. free surplus is lower as 2013 included GBP 78 million of positive longevity assumption change, which has not recurred. \r\nTotal new business strain was broadly unchanged at GBP 606 million. As you can see in the bottom right, Asia strain increased, reflecting higher sales volumes and changes in country mix. In the U.S., strain benefited from proactive actions on commissions and favorable changes in product mix, higher Elite Access, for example. The U.K.'s total new business strain includes GBP 31 million for bulks, which represents part of the extra investment that we said we would make in the U.K.\r\nThis next slide shows how the 2014 free surplus flow has impacted free surplus stock on the left and cash on the right. As you can see in the chart on the left, after deducting remittances, the overall stock is up at around GBP 5 billion. However, as our business is now bigger, the level of cover that this stock represents is broadly unchanged. \r\nOnce again, remittances have been strong across all businesses. The impact of sterling strength against Asian currencies is now beginning to come through in the remittances from Asia, and you should expect this effect to carry through into 2015. \r\nJackson's record remittance of GBP 415 million was the result of its disciplined approach to managing the balance between growth, value risk and capital. M&G's high remittance reflected growth in its overall earnings base. As previously flagged, the small decline in the U.K. remittance is due to the extra investment that we are making in response to the U.K. market reforms, which will continue through to 2016. As you're aware, remittances from our UK Life businesses are subject to regulatory approval. And notwithstanding the capital-generative nature of this business, I anticipate that securing approval will be more protracted this year as we transition from the old -- from the existing regulatory regime into the new one.\r\nFinally, on the right, you can see that after paying a higher dividend, funding the upfront fee for the renewal of the SCB distribution agreement and repaying $750 million denominated hybrid debt, we closed the year with GBP 1.5 billion of central cash, a very comfortable position. \r\nBefore leaving this topic, I wanted to reemphasize the reliability of our future cash generation by reference to the updated undiscounted risk monetization profile of our Life businesses. The dark blue bars in the top chart represent the end 2013 life in-force book monetization profile as we reported a year ago. The light blue bars represent the updated profile of this block 1 year later. These bars are now higher than before, reflecting positive experience and the effect of the stronger U.S. dollar, which taken together, have offset the impact of lower yield between the 2 periods. \r\nWhen we add the cash flows from the 2014 new business cohort shown in red, we have another profile that is higher than the one we started with, evidence of the powerful capital velocity capital dynamics of our business. We remain on track to deliver the GBP 10 billion cumulative free surplus objective after financing new business of the 2014 to 2017 full year period.\r\nI will now briefly cover the EEV results before turning to capital. On this basis, total operating profit was 4% higher at GBP 4,096 million, equivalent to a return on embedded value of 16%. As shown on the left, the result is driven by our combined life operations where profits were up at GBP 4,174 million, led by Asia. \r\nThe bar chart on the right analyzes the contribution to the life total from new business, which was up 10%, and from in-force, which was flat. As I mentioned at the start of my presentation, the decline in long-term yields during 2014 dampened our both new and in-force EEV results by an estimated GBP 90 million for new business and GBP 187 million for in-force. And this effect masks a strongly positive underlying trend. \r\nExperience profit, shown in the breakout box on the right, remained a prominent feature of our results, totaling GBP 470 million, while assumption changes were also positive at GBP 138 million. The fact that experience and assumption changes are positive in each of our 3 main businesses confirms the high quality of our franchise. \r\nNew business profit, shown on this next slide, increased by 10% to GBP 2,126 million, with all 3 businesses posting year-on-year improvement. You can see in the table on the right that this improvement is primarily driven by sales growth, offset by the adverse impact of lower interest rates. All 3 regions continued to write new business at very attractive internal rates of return of more than 20% in short payback periods. \r\nIn Asia, new business profit increased by 13% to GBP 1,162 million, primarily driven by the higher volumes from our expanding distribution capability. Our NBP performance in the region is both robust and resilient, underpinned by a 16% NBP increase from our Southeast Asia sweet spot and a 19% NBP increase from health and protection. \r\nIn the U.S., new business profit increased in line with sales. Product and pricing actions have depended on new business economics, which remain close to all-time highs despite the drag from the lower interest rate environment. \r\nU.K. NBP was 14% higher at GBP 270 million, supported by a strong contribution from bulk transactions in the year. Retail NBP was 23% lower due to a reduction in individual annuity sales, mitigated in part by higher NBP contribution from with-profit bonds.\r\nMoving now to the rest of the profit and loss account, which is summarized here for both reporting basis. In 2014, the impact of higher equity markets and lower long-term yields produced a number of offsetting effects within the IFRS investment variance line, which came to a negative GBP 0.3 billion. The more significant component in this line relates to Jackson. For the reasons that we have set out previously, the different accounting treatment on the movements in the valuation of derivatives and the corresponding guarantee reserves produced a net negative result, which has been a recurring feature of Jackson's results on this basis, reflecting imperfect IFRS accounting. We continue to hedge the risks of this business on an economic basis and accept the accounting volatility that ensues. \r\nAs we move down the table, we see a positive GBP 0.6 billion effect, reflecting unrealized gains on Jackson's fixed income securities following the declining yields. The stronger U.S. dollar at the end of 2014 also contributed positively. So after the payment of dividends, total IFRS net assets increased to GBP 11.6 billion, up 22% in the year. On an EEV basis, which does not suffer from the same limitations as IFRS in reflecting the full economic substance of market movements on our U.S. business, the overall investment variances were positive GBP 0.2 billion. Therefore under this basis, the strength of our operating performance, together with positive foreign exchange effect, net of dividends, produced a 17% increase in EEV net assets to GBP 29.2 billion, equivalent to an uplift of 165p to 1,136p per share. \r\nThe next few slides cover the group's economic capital position and our preparation for the implementation of Solvency II. We're now less than 1 year away from having to adopt Solvency II. However, there remains significant areas where policy clarifications are needed. We intend to apply for a full internal model in June and we will seek to incorporate Jackson using the equivalent  provisions. PRA internal model review, feedback and final approval is not expected until later this year, which means that we will only have full clarity on this topic once this entire process is completed.\r\nWe have updated the group's economic capital results, which are based on outputs from our internal model. Other than replacing the liquidity premium approach with the matching adjustment principles for U.K. annuities, these results have been produced using broadly the same methodology and assumptions as last year. So we continue to assume U.S. equivalents and have included Jackson's excess surplus above the 250% RBC level. Our methodology recognizes fully the value of overseas economic capital and incorporates a risk margin in line with the Solvency II requirements. \r\nNow based on this methodology and assumptions, our economic capital at the end of 2014 was GBP 9.7 billion, equivalent to a healthy cover of 218%. \r\nAs you can see on the right, our business operations delivered GBP 1.8 billion of economic capital in the year, equivalent to around 25 points of cover. As this capital measure is more market sensitive, the impact of the decline in U.K. interest rates is more pronounced, contributing to a negative movement of GBP 0.9 billion. So before capital actions and notwithstanding the adverse market effects, our business performance drove an overall increase in economic capital. \r\nThe remaining items, shown in light blue, reflect the impact of deploying our economic capital to renew our distribution agreement with SCB, repay hybrid debt, domesticate the Hong Kong business and pay the external dividend. The negative GBP 0.3 billion for model changes is mainly due to the impact of adopting the matching adjustment principles. So the key messages here are: one, that we are capital generative on this risk-sensitive metric, reaffirming the positive cash and capital dynamics of our business; two, that the overall reduction in the level of capital was principally driven by deliberate actions in pursuit of our strategy; and three, that our year-end position remains strong even in this historically low-yield environment. \r\nWe have updated the analysis of the economic risk profile of the business, which is broadly unchanged from last year and is not highly concentrated to any particular risk type. We have also updated the sensitivity of the end 2014 economic capital position to a range of market shocks, shown before the impact of potential management actions, and that's important. Even though the financial impact of these sensitivities is a little higher than the previous year, which is due to the lower end 2014 interest rate levels, the overall effect of these market stresses is manageable, reaffirming the resilience of our business model.\r\nBefore leaving this topic, I would reiterate that these results should not be interpreted as representing our Solvency II capital position. As I have already mentioned, policy remains unclear in a number of areas, while in others, it is ultimately subject to regulatory interpretation and supervisory judgment. We have provided you with some indicative sensitivities in your pack on 3 key areas under discussion based on completely, and I stress, completely hypothetical assumptions. These are: one, the impact of an artificial hair cut to Asia's economic capital contribution to the group total under the Solvency II fungibility tests, which as Tidjane has said, would not represent economic reality; two, the impact of calibrating U.K. credit and longevity 1 year stresses above levels that we would deem appropriate; and lastly, the offsetting effect of applying transitional relief in the U.K. for differences between the economic capital and the Solvency I Pillar 2 position. \r\nWhile we would expect the Solvency II result to be lower than the GBP 9.7 billion of economic capital, our starting point is strong, and our business remains highly capital generative in nature. This fundamental feature of our business is unaffected by Solvency II and underpins our confidence in the overall capital dynamics and capital position of the group.\r\nI have provided, on this next slide, the usual update on balance sheet. In summary, we remain well capitalized and defensively positioned. The group's IGD surplus at the end of the year is estimated at GBP 4.7 billion. And this is after deducting, in aggregate, GBP 1.3 billion for the full upfront fee of renewing the SCB agreement, the hybrid debt repayment and other corporate activity. The financial strength of the U.K. with-profits estate remains a core part of our product offering. And this stood at GBP 7.2 billion at the end of 2014, up from GBP 6.8 billion at the start of the year. \r\nThe U.S. RBC ratio has improved to 456% after covering the record cash remittance, underlying Jackson's disciplined approach to risk management. On this basis, the hedge program was essentially breakeven, as movements in hedge assets and guaranteed reserves broadly offset. And finally, in response to your requests, we have provided you with some additional disclosure on our exposure to oil and gas, which, in our view, is well contained, are properly diversified and focused on the high-quality names. For further details, please refer to the appendix slide. \r\nSo to summarize, we delivered a strong broad-based performance in 2014 against the challenging backdrop. The group remains highly cash generative, given by the predictable generation of free surplus from our growing life in-force book. Our capital position and conservative balance sheet remains a source of strength for our business and adds to our resilience. And finally, we are positive on the financial outlook of our business and have signaled our confidence in our future prospects through the 10% rebate in our full year dividend. I will now pass you back to Tidjane.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Well, thanks a lot, Nic. I'm now going to talk to you about the final part of this presentation, our outlook is positive and confident. And I'll start really with the basics. Where do we compete? Where are we? We think that we have an attractive footprint. As you know, we have 24 million customers across regions. And our footprint is really Asia, the U.S., the U.K. and [indiscernible] 2 spots in Africa, there we're starting. But we think that the point about this is if you look at new growth, not the stock of assets, our new growth where we are represent 63% of GDP growth expected in the next 5 years and that's a great place to be. But  presence alone is not a guarantee of success. It's a function of your capabilities and having the right strategy. \r\nWe believe we have the right strategy. In both geographic areas, we are focused on the right opportunities. It's the emerging middle-class in Asia, and it's savings and investment needs -- sorry, saving and protection needs, the U.S. baby boomers and transitioning into retirement and the U.K., which is a very attractive asset management and savings market. So if you look at the scale of those opportunities, the many, many assessment of the middle-class in Asia, but in our sweet spot, so just the sweet spot countries, Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, we expect the middle class to grow by more than 100 million in the decade between 2010 and '20, that is more than the entire population of the U.K. and we have 8 million customers in that space. So we think that the headroom is very, very significant. \r\nLook at the U.S., we expect 16 million more retirees in that same decade and that's more business for us. And if you look at the U.K., we think the assets under management to increase by to more than GBP 1 trillion over the same decade. And again, it's the second largest market in the world so we saw massive opportunities. \r\nWe have the capability and the execution to capture them, and that's really the next slide where we just give you the progression in our Health and Protection sales in Asia in 6 years that have more than doubled. If you look at the U.S., again, more than doubled in terms of sales and deposit by products, which you can also see the make-up has been transformed. VAs, which were smaller than fixed annuities, in the dark blue, in '08 are now more than 3x the volume of fixed annuities, that's again a transformation. And I could also talk about M&G and its success in the retail asset management market. \r\nBut all that, if it doesn't translate into tangible returns, it's not really meaningful. The good news is we haven't been able, through the disciplined execution, to grow that red bar, which is really the free surplus generation, to keep the blue bar going down, the new business strain under control, as the group gets bigger. In absolute terms, it hasn't really moved, which means that the light blue bar, to cash generative after new business strain has been growing very nicely, which has allowed us, and that's my, really, my final slide, to have a very nice slope of -- in the dividend and take it above the precrisis level, which for a financial services company is a good performance. \r\nSo to summarize and close and conclude. We are in the right places. We have the right strategy. The execution is good, 2014 was a good year. We have no intention to change the strategy. It served us very well. There's plenty of headroom. And Asia is at the center of all this, for very obvious reasons, it's more than 1/2 the world's population. It continues to grow. Even if the absolute growth rate may slow down on a relative basis is still a very, very high growth area. And we are uniquely positioned in Asia. We've got our distribution platform, our capabilities and our team to do well. Of course, we don't ignore the clouds on the horizon. Certainly, lower for longer. The low long-term interest rates, is a particular challenge for the industry but we think that we have effective responses for that. We have a strong balance sheet. \r\nNic and I have spent a lot of time talking to you about the cash generative nature of our business model and how that allows us to deal with the challenges of new Solvency models. And again, we believe that, that strong balance sheet leaves us well-positioned to deliver long-term shareholder value. So with that, I will stop. I will ask my Executive Director colleagues to join us on the podium here and we will start taking your question. \r\nRaghu, if you want to allocate the -- and Richard, yes.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Paul Myers (Executives)】\nGood morning, and thank you for coming to our investor presentation this morning. You will have seen the announcement we made this morning alongside our annual results for 2014 and the announcement made by Crédit Suisse. \r\nOf course, the board is sorry to lose Tidjane as Group CEO but understands his desire to take on a new challenge in a new environment after 7 very successful years at Prudential. He made -- he's made an outstanding contribution to the success of this group in recent years, and that can be seen in today's results. \r\nWe are fortunate to have a strong management team beyond Tidjane. The board also has a rigorous succession planning process, and that is now being implemented. We believe we'll be in a position to announce the name of the new CEO very shortly. You will, of course, be aware that the appointment is subject to regulatory approval. \r\nThat's all I'm going to say. I'm going to pass over to Tidjane. Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Cheick Thiam (Executives)】\nThank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you, Paul. Good morning to all of you. Thank you for being here. \r\nThose of you who know me know that I will not miss an opportunity to point out that I am -- today's kind of a tale [ph] event because we have a day after Arsenal beat Man U at Old Trafford. So that this mean in the -- yes, thank you, particularly good mood. So -- it doesn't happen very often. So anyway, again, good morning. \r\nWe've had a broad-based performance in 2014, a really good year. And if you look back to what we said in 2010, Growth and Cash, I believe it's the fifth consecutive year where we have delivered on both commitments. So what I intend to do is -- in my section is to give you the highlights of our financial performance in 2014. I will also cover kind of a usual BU-by-BU overview, then Nic will take you through the financials, and I will come back towards the end for the outlook before we move to Q&A.\r\nSo if we begin with 2014 and the performance, you've seen the numbers this morning. We have made good progress across our key metrics. And if you start with growth in IFRS profits, IFRS profits are up 14% and very fundamentally, over 5 years, doubled for the group as a whole but also doubled for each of Asia, M&G and Jackson, which is really underlying, this was good performance. \r\nNew business profit, which is something we've always looked at more closely when AP is up 10% at GBP 2,126 million. And we are satisfied with this number given the low interest rate environment, and the interest rate's -- long-term interest rate is going down in 2014. And also, as you know, the fact that in Jackson, we have a sales cap, a self-imposed sales cap. So in that context, to grow at 10% is very pleasing. \r\nAnd the third thing we've encouraged you to follow and judge us on is really cash for free surplus generation, which is part of our 2017 objectives and which is up 9% at GBP 2.5 billion. It's a number I'll come back to from its fundamental that this group in the way it operates generate in excess of GBP 2 billion every year. And that is core to our strategy. \r\nAnd finally, we've been able to increase tangible returns for shareholders. By that, I mean the dividend, which is rebased upwards by 10% to be at 36.93p. That said, we reiterate that our dividend policy hasn't changed, so we'll come back to it in Q&A, but it's always the same. And this rebase has also been decided by the board because of the strong operating and financial performance of the group. \r\nAnd if we move to capital, whether it's on the -- almost in its last year the old regime, the IGD regime, we have a cover of 2.4x at GBP 4.7 billion, after a number of Jewish IGD costly moves in 2014 that Nic will come back to from the SCB deal to repaying the hybrid debt. And on an economic basis, on the same basis we presented it last year, we're on 218% solvency from 257%. \r\nWe believe that these numbers are the translation of our strategy, which has been unchanged. We've heard -- you've heard us say the same things for a number of years, and we believe this strategy is robust, works across the cycle and delivers good result. And '14 is a good illustration of that because if you look at the backdrop of 2014, it hasn't been without its challenges. And pretty certainly, in my years here, I don't remember a quiet year. And we can go around the globe, from challenges in Asia, from the Umbrella Movement, the Hong Kong protests, which worried a lot of you, the coup in Thailand, Indonesia, we were referring at the beginning of the year the election that had a huge impact on consumer confidence in Indonesia. You have the FX depreciation across the board in excess of 20%. \r\nThese are very significant market moves. You've had in Europe, closer to us here, everybody has kind of forgotten it, but the Scottish independence vote and the uncertainty induced by that. You've had the budget reform and the disruption to the annuity market. And you have more global trends or phenomena, such as the commodity price volume fall or the oil price fall, which has an impact in the markets we operate in, the question of the normalization of the U.S. monetary policy with the end of QE3 or in Europe, in the eurozone, a new QE and lower interest rates in their fight against deflation or the threat of deflations and, as we said, regulate it to avoid an embedding in the expectations of deflation. \r\nSo it was not an easy year, and this makes us reasonably happy with the numbers we have been able to deliver. Our job as management is to try and deliver for our shareholders good results even against headwinds. \r\nAnd if you look at the progression by BU in '14, you see that Asia IFRS is up 17%, and 8 of 11 business units in Asia had double-digit growth in IFRS profits. If you look at the U.S., it's again a really bright spot with a record remittance, USD 680 million or GBP 415 million. To put this in context, in 2006, the total remittances from all the businesses in the U.K. -- sorry, into Prudential, the U.K. into the center, are GBP 99 million. So that gives you a sense of the scale of the transformation and the performance of Jackson there. \r\nSo '14 was 45% up on '13, and '13 was 17.5% up on '12. So it's been really over 3 years of very, very strong progression. And we -- you know that we believe that the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and cash is the ultimate measure of everything we do. And by that metric, we've done very well. \r\nIf you look closer to home here in the U.K., PruFund, which is really our with-profit product, a very strong progression in 2014, plus 27% in funds under management to reach almost GBP 12 billion, GBP 11.6 billion for a single fund in the retail U.K. market, that's an amazing performance. And M&G up 13% in profits at GBP 446 million for M&G. Again, if you look back a few years ago, you'll see that the entire Prudential used to make GBP 600 million or GBP 700 million a year. So M&G has become almost as big as Pru used to be. \r\nSo this validates, we believe, our strategy. And I think it's the illustration that the strategy we've put in place works. One thing we've talked to you about for many, many years, I remember, when we started doing this, there was just one bar in 2008, the first time we did this disclosure, which is the sources of earnings. And we've told you that we would work hard to de-correlate to the extent possible our earnings from interest rates, and that's what we've done. For the emphasis on fee income, the emphasis on insurance income, the sum of the 2 have gone from about 50% of the initial or in total to 74% today. And the total bar has more than doubled in the process, so a CAGR of 19% over 8 years from the 2 together is very, very significant. And it has really transformed the nature of our earnings. \r\nWe don't really like spread income because we think that it is risky, often underlying better products with interest rate guarantees and guaranteed returns. It's capital-intensive, and it's very exposed to economic cycle and the interest rate cycle, and we deemphasize it. \r\nAnd actually, when we write that type of business, as you know, we tend to put it in the with-profit fund where we have a comfortable capital buffer. So this is really underlying if you have a valuation multiple, spread income is on a relatively low multiple. And a lot of the re-rating of the stock has been in the ability to deliver this profit and this change in profile, which makes us, we believe, quite different from most companies in the sector, which have anywhere from 50% to 80% of their earnings from spread income. \r\nAnd it's -- the lucky part is that we've done that at the time when interest rates went to one of the lowest points ever. So it certainly has increased the distance between us and others. But it's really this consistency in the direction of the journey and in performance that's brought our confidence that we are going to achieve our 2017 objectives. Showing about it as a 10 half-year period, we've done 4. So we're not even halfway, but we think that we are tracking well, and it's encouraging.\r\nSo moving on to something I know which is on your mind, which is really capital and solvency. The first I'm going to have to say is that the first source of capital in business is to operate profitably and in a cash-generative manner. All our efforts in terms of running the company with a strategy for business model is to make sure that we deliver every year positive cash generation, I said GBP 2.5 billion in 2014. \r\nWe actually believe that, that will allow us to grow our way out of any capital challenge because when you're progressing and -- at that pace, and again, Nic will give you more color on that, you can't really get in a insolvency trouble. And we believe that whatever lens you adopt for solvency, that strength will come through. \r\nCash is cash is cash is capital, and that's right. So we have designed the model, and that's why we're so reluctant about it and quite confident because we know we can operate at that level and think that there's plenty of upside there, which is with interest rates, long-term interest rates at a very, very low level, we can generate GBP 2.5 billion of cash.\r\nSo Solvency II is an interesting measure. You know that we have had reservations about it. We have always been very clear about what they are. Essentially, 2. One is around market consistency as a way to assess assets and liabilities across the economic cycle. We do not think it works. I think we were vindicated in '08, '09. We don't think it works at all times in the cycle. There are moments where it's fine, but there are moments where it's not. And the other one is really 1 year of value at risk, which we believe is incorrect because insurance companies are resolved as their liabilities come due. And that's not 1 year. And the 1 year metric, which is of the banking origin, is inappropriate and inadequate in the case of long-term liabilities like we have in the life sector. \r\nSo what are the structural deficiencies of the framework? And you see that a lot of the discussion in lobbying has been actually on mitigating that, all right, either through countercylical buffers or it's matching the adjustment [ph] of others, it's to mitigate at the extreme of the cycle the impact of that approach. \r\nSo accepting that, we're also very pragmatic even if we are not convinced that it's the right way to look at it. It is going to be implemented on January 1, 2016, so we do not have a choice. But we believe, even taking into account that there are still some areas under discussion with the regulator, and I have to stress it's a positive and a constructive dialogue. We're very happy with the engagement we have with the regulator on that. And there are mainly 2 issues there. One is around the recognition of the Asian surpluses. We are a very Asian company. We produce very significant material surpluses in Asia, and the regulator must make a determination on how much of a surplus it is going to recognize. \r\nOur view on that, again, from an economic value perspective, is that those surpluses exist, okay, in absolute terms, and they belong 100% to a shareholder. The debate on how much of it is recognized here in London is not economic, and it won't change the economic reality. So we have said that there is a discussion on that. But we're saying it doesn't affect the underlying economics. Those surpluses are sitting where we are sitting, and they are occurring to the shareholder for the share price. You can see it in the share price. You can see it in the valuation of our Asian business. Those surpluses are real. And we have discussions on the calibration really of things like credit and longevity, and they're ongoing. \r\nBut the message, the key takeaway on that is we're running a highly capital-generative strategy and business model, and we think that the result will be manageable. That's the word we want to put to you, manageable, i.e., without major consequences on the way we run the group strategy or our ability to reward our shareholders. And Nic will come back to that and give you the sensitivities with more numbers. \r\nSo that's all I wanted to say at the group level. So if we move to the business units. So we have a chart that you've seen. Over here is a quarter-by-quarter. Sales in Asia, again, when we started it, it was -- there weren't many bars. We now have quite a few. We've had 20 quarters of growth above 16% in Asia. That's 5 years. And to us, that's really the power of the story. And it illustrates very much the power of the platform and the diversification we have in Asia because if we wanted to make a very busy chart, we could have put all the challenges we've had over the years, from the Indian market in 2010, from trends in Korea, from Indonesia this year. I don't remember in my time in the company a quiet year in Asia, and Barry and his team have been able to deliver for you a straight line through that. \r\nAnd really that's just diversification and the quality of the platform and the quality of the distribution force, which has allowed us, if you look at the numbers, to double basically the sales between '09 and '14, and the profits in the same period are effectively more than doubled.\r\nFocusing on Q4. You can see the size of that bar. We've seen a very strong rebound in our numbers in Q4 in Asia, and I think that came through in the results you saw this morning. And I'd like to give you a bit of color on how it happened, looking at some of our key markets. \r\nStarting with Hong Kong. Remember, many discussions about Hong Kong being a mature market, where it was up 39% for us this year year-on-year. And more pleasing inside that is that H&P has taken off, health and protection. It's something we've always wanted to do. You know that  our profile in Hong Kong is very effective. In fact, we have a with-profit fund. Profit immersion is slow, and we always had as an ambition to inject more health and protection in there with -- Barry has launched 2 products: PRUmyhealth crisis multi-care and PRUmyhealth crisis lifelong care, which have been very successful. And actually, H&P sales were up 56% year-on-year in Hong Kong. \r\nWhen you see the size of Hong Kong, it's actually our largest business. To grow your largest business by 39% and 56% is quite an achievement. \r\nSingapore, we have a very large business in Asia. It did well. Agency APE is up 16%. You know that actually, the market grew less than that, so we've gained market share in Singapore. And within that, SCB had a very good year also, up 12%. So we're, again, pleased with the performance in Singapore, which is growing very nicely in double digits and very profitable. \r\nAnd Indonesia, always a lot of focus on that country. We have told you things as they were as the year unfolded, Q1, Q2, Q3. Q4 was very strong. Q4 was up 53% on Q3. And we see absolutely Indonesia returning to growth. And I'm sure we'll have a chance to talk about it at Q1 in May that we're confident. \r\nSo those are the 3 biggest units. But we also have a range of smaller units that are coming up. China, China has made it on this chart because growth at 30% per annum for a number of years will take you to a good place. IFRS was up 30%. APE was up 35%. And again, here, the H&P, health and protection, theme is there, with health and protection, very helpful to our bottom line, up 43% in China. \r\nThe interesting thing about China is we disclosed only our 49% holding. If you put China on the 100% basis, it's my pleasure to tell you that China is now our fourth largest business in Asia. So that's taken over Malaysia. It's a major development for us, and it's continuing to grow very, very strongly. So the patience, I think, we have displayed there by not selling down and continuing is starting to pay off to have a material presence in our scale in China. And that's going to continue to grow.\r\nThe Philippines is kind of our little darling in the region. You know that. It's a great economy. Over the next 3 years, we have the best expected economic growth, GDP growth in Asia. Earnings up 75%, and we focused on growing our regular premium in health and protection sales in that market before it's too low. 30% up regular premiums, with great promise of future profits, and health and protection up 36% again. \r\nAnd finally, Thailand. We had our first full year with Thanachart, so 12 months with Thanachart. APE is up 36%, and IFRS earnings up 10%. \r\nSo we see the first division doing very well, and the second division below, smaller but growing faster and catching up. And we always believe that in the end, they're all going to end up in first division, we hope. \r\nMaybe just to resume on SCB because it's a topic of interest. We spend shareholder money to get that distribution. So it's very important for us that we produce the returns. And the year-on-year progression, second half-to-second half, '13, '14, is 33%. And that is really broad-based, very strong performance in Hong Kong and elsewhere in Asia. The new markets we activated, so when we talk about activating, we see this as a new relationship. We're very, very pleased with this progression. \r\nBut Asia is not just life, although I have said [indiscernible] here is about the life. We said it's also Eastspring, and Eastspring has had simply its best year ever. GBP 5.4 billion of net flows, external net flows. That's almost on the scale of M&G. It's remarkable. And you see the funds under management going up 28%, GBP 77 billion. And behind that, we have profit going up 32% to a very -- getting close to GBP 100 million, which is kind of material for our business we've built over many years and started from over -- from nothing. Actually, Eastspring is now the largest onshore retail asset manager in Asia, and we're quite proud of that. And again, Barry, Guy and the team have done a great job on this. \r\nNow what I say on the scenario, don't get carried away. We know it's a cyclical and volatile business, and it's very much driven by market. So we always have a word of caution there against projecting those trends as they are, but it's still a very, very pleasing result. \r\nSo if you look at Asia as a whole, again, IFRS profit is now -- it's comfortably above GBP 1 billion, GBP 1.1 billion. Again, a few years ago, the group was making GBP 600 million or GBP 700 million as a whole. So that's again a remarkable transformation of Asia, and cash-generative, with almost GBP 600 million of cash, if I remember, in '92, up 15%, so a really good year. \r\nStrong delivery in 2014 in Asia in a challenging context. I'll remind you all these numbers were produced against all the headwinds we talked about in the region last year. Disciplined execution by the team, high-quality Pan-Asian platform, and we believe the business remain well positioned to deliver long-term, high-quality, profitable growth.\r\n \r\nSo moving on to the U.S. Now I'll go back to a chart we've been using now for 12 years, but a good thing is that we're building more data points. The evolution of the VA sales in the U.S. has been nothing short of remarkable, very, very strong. We went from kind of $6 billion 6 years ago to about $23 billion this year. \r\nBut the true story is inside those numbers. If you look at the gray chart, which should come first, these are the GMWB, so the VAs with living benefits. We keep emphasizing that actually since '11, they have been flat but deliberate, moving up and down, USD 15.1 billion in '14, but this is a point on which we're a bit sensitive. We believe that we're controlling that volume of sales. Mike and his team are well in control of that. They are very corrective about it. We have a budget every year, and we deliver on that budget, and we think that is absolutely supported by the data. \r\nBut we have an interest on that. We've been innovative. They created Elite Access. Elite Access, $5.1 billion this year of sales. Since it started 3 years ago, we sold now $10 billion of this product. And I say it might have created a market because it's -- actually in VAs, it's the #4 product on a stand-alone basis across the U.S. market. Elite Access alone, that is a commercial success. That is a testament of the product development skills and the distribution power that Jackson has. And finally, you have the VA's result, any living benefits that are in dark blue. \r\nSo we've been able to prove this trick of combining a controlled risk consumption with a continued increase in the top line. And that's what drives the economic performance of a business. And if you look at the nonliving benefit VAs, they've gone from 11% 3 years ago to 34% now. That's a very, very good development. It's also as a whole a more capital-efficient mix, and you will see that when Nic talks about the new business stream.\r\nSo low interest rates, of course, is always a discussion. So we've given you the U.S. 10-year treasury yield here in blue, and we've put that against the fee income. And again, there, if you look at the '06 numbers, GBP 177 million of fee income, GBP 1.4 billion this year. It's a remarkable performance, and the fact that we have driven both the volume and the product characteristics to generate this type of profitability in the low interest rate environment, it's one of the things that give us confidence that this is a robust business model that can survive and do well across the cycle. \r\nAnd no better proof of that than my favorite chart, the cash remittances from Jackson. There's nowhere to hide. At the end of the day, we've told you judge us on the cash generation. These transfers have been made with a strong RBC. We're at 450%, 456% at the end of the year, 450%, and $680 million of transfer. I don't have anything to add to that. It's a remarkable performance. \r\nMoving on to the U.K. Jackie and the team have had a challenging year. You've seen what happened in the market with the budget announcement. So in that context, we are really pleased with the performance. IFRS profit, up 7%, and we're putting gray there with in-force because it's obvious and you all know it. But to just repeat the importance of in-force in the profitability of a company like ours, yes, there is a lot of focus on new business. And that's what Tidjane [ph] has commented upon, that really, most of the value is emerging with in-force. And the business is very good at doing that. And that only happens as a result of good discipline, cost discipline, express management, lapse management. That's what drives these numbers, so we're very pleased with that GBP 614 million. \r\nAnd at the top, you see what happened, the decrease in the retail entities' profitability from GBP 110 million to GBP 57 million, and the very strong activity we've had in bulks. And I will again insist one didn't drive the other. This was just a very good year for bulks. If the conditions for writing profitable business had not been there, we would not have written that business. We didn't write it to make up for the fall in annuities. We wrote it because there's very strong demand for bulks. \r\nJackie has one of the best teams in the market. And there are customers who will pay a premium for the safety of Prudential and for the name of Prudential. And that's where we like to play in the very big schemes, where we understand the value we are buying and are willing to pay a premium price that then meets our hurdle rates in terms of capital allocation and deal and trade with us. So it's been a really good story. \r\nThe other bright spot really in the U.K. is the with-profit. I know we keep surprising by talking up the with-profit, but we have no reason not to talk it up. If you look at the -- what does it do? It delivers controlled volatility and returns. That's that red curve. And that red curve is against the fund comparator that's relevant, and you can see the outperformance. We've outperformed the FTSE. \r\nAnd of course, investment performance in the retail market drive net flows. The net flows have been very, very strong. We were just 2 years before at GBP 7.5 billion. We're at GBP 11.6 billion. We did plus 21%, followed by plus 27%. \r\nAnd this is where we think actually the reform is driving increased savings. We think that is linked to the environment where consumers are actually incentivized to save more. And we have a great engine, a great vehicle for the savings that we wrap in different wrappers. But fundamentally, it delivers good investment performance and therefore attracts flows. So that's part of our answer to the regulatory change for which we're preparing in the U.K. \r\nIf you look at the retirement phase, we've been able to come up with a drawdown. That's been launched in December very successfully. We're also developing a more flexible investment product, giving more choice to investors. It is doing very well. \r\nIf you move to the savings space, we told you we would develop a proof on ISA, so good growing profit in an ISA that has been done. And the indications I have from the business is that the applications are very, very strong, ahead of April 6. We're only going to put it through after April 6, and it's very strong, very strong pipeline, and Jackie can give you more color on that. \r\nSo stronger presence in the retirement space, better savings offering and stronger distribution. We have now developed a bond that can go on platforms, and we are actively promoting it to put it on more platforms. And that also contributes to the increase in sales. But if you look at the proof on the increase, quite a bit of that is increased distribution. We just have been able to put more products on the shelves of more distributors with very good results.\r\nSo the U.K. for us is always -- UK Life but also M&G. If you look at M&G, this chart is familiar. If you look at the -- in red, it's the external funds under management. We went from GBP 70 billion in 2009 to GBP 137 billion in 2014, so it's more than doubled. And in the same time, Michael and his team have grown profits. You can see on the next slide the progression in IFRS profit. We have more than doubled between '09 and '14 to arrive above GBP 400 million. \r\nSo bringing all of these together, and I just want to look at our 3 usual metrics: IFRS, NBP and cash. But at the group level, we are pleased with this performance. It's been over a long period of time, I think, which is really the main thing, because it's -- especially the 1 or 2 years, but this is -- now can be called a long track record of very strong performance. Profits have trebled since 2006. IFRS went from GBP 1 billion to GBP 3 billion. And we insist together the consistency of the strategy. We've been quite boringly telling you about the same things, and I'm afraid we will continue to do so. \r\nNew business profit, same thing, more than 3x increase between '06 and 2014. And finally, free surplus generation, which we have really emphasized, the cash generation, from kind of GBP 0.5 billion to GBP 2.5 billion, which we believe is a very natural evolution because you start with NBP, goes into IFRS, goes into cash if you are disciplined and if you execute well, which is what we believe we have done. \r\nSo with this, I'm going to stop, and I'm going to let Nic take you through the financials.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Nicolaos Nicandrou (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you, Tidjane, and good morning, everyone. \r\nIn my presentation, I will provide you with a detailed look at the drivers of our performance in 2015 and give you an update on our capital position and on our balance sheet.\r\nSo starting with the -- can we go back? Starting with the financial headlines. The group delivered a strong performance in 2014, with good progress across all of our key Growth and Cash financial measures. We achieved this against the backdrop of lower global yields and continued volatility in currency markets. \r\nOperationally, we faced a number of country-specific challenges in Asia and unprecedented levels of regulatory change in the U.K. life market. Despite these headwinds and after allowing for the currency translation effect, IFRS operating profit increased by 14% to GBP 3.2 billion. Free surplus generation was up 9% to GBP 2.6 billion. Post-tax new business profit rose 10% to GBP 2.1 billion. And embedded value operating profit, also on a post-tax basis, rose by 4% at GBP 4.1 billion. \r\nBoth new business profit and EEV operating profit were adversely impacted by the decline in yield. Absent which, the year-on-year improvement in these performance metrics would have been 14% for NBP and 11% for EEV total.\r\nForeign exchange has been a feature in our headline results during 2014 when reporting the performance of those businesses that generate earnings in U.S. dollars or in various Asian currencies. Collectively, this business has now produced most of our earnings. The effect of reporting these overseas results using the stronger average sterling rate during 2014 is shown in the red bars on the right. \r\nAs we have said before, this effect is purely translational because, in all cases, we run local currency businesses where assets and liabilities are currency-matched, and we have no transactional cross-currency exposures. So in line with the approach that I adopted at the interims and for the purposes of today's presentation, I have reexpressed the 2013 comparatives on a constant exchange rate basis. \r\nThis slide summarizes the effect of this retranslation on the 4 financial metrics that I'm about to cover, with the impact coming from Jackson shown in dark blue and that coming from Asia in light blue. With this covered, we can now focus on the underlying drivers of our performance.\r\nTurning to the contribution of our 4 businesses for -- to each financial metric. You can see on this slide that the improvement in performance was broad-based. Asia delivered an excellent trading performance, with strong growth across all measures, particularly IFRS operating profit and free surplus generation, the 2 metrics that form part of our 2017 financial objectives. \r\nIn the U.S., the benefits of our disciplined approach to managing the balance between growth, risk and capital were evident in the strong improvement in the IFRS operating profit and free surplus generation. The 2 EEV-based metrics also improved despite the self-imposed sales cap on certain products and the drag from lower U.S. treasury rates. In a year of considerable market disruption, our UK Life business delivered a resilient performance, achieving the highest levels of new business in IFRS operating profit since the 2008 financial crisis. \r\nFinally, M&G reached new highs for both funds under management and IFRS profit. \r\nSo this 2014 broad-based delivery demonstrates Prudential's ongoing ability to generate both Growth and Cash, a distinctive feature within our industry. \r\nI would now like to look at each financial measure in more detail. \r\nStarting with IFRS. Total operating profit increased by 14% to GBP 3,186 million, which represents a 26% return on equity. As you can see on the right, most of this increase came from our preferred sources of fee income and insurance or technical income. The rise in fee income was driven by growth in Jackson's separate account balances as well as the increase in funds managed by M&G and Eastspring. The improvement in technical income reflected another year of strong health and protection growth in Asia and a higher contribution from REALIC. \r\nSpread income grew at a more modest rate as we seek to reduce the weight of this interest rate-sensitive source. Operating costs have also increased but at a lower run rate than total income, demonstrating once again the operational leverage in our business. So in 2014, we increased both the scale and the quality of our IFRS operating profit.\r\nTurning to the IFRS results for each business and starting with Asia. Our overall profit was up 17%, with strong underlying performances in both life and asset management. Our life profits of GBP 1,050 million reflected the increase in the scale of our operations across the region and our focus on regular premium protection-oriented solutions that address the needs of Asia's growing middle class. \r\nWe measure the scale of our business by reference to policyholder liabilities, which, as you can see in the top right-hand box, increased by 20% to GBP 26.4 billion as we added another cohort of regular premium new business. As a result, total income across the region grew by 10%, which outpaced the 6% increase in costs. \r\nSo the dynamic that we have talked about before of adding high-quality new regular premium business to a large, profitable and sticky existing book, all processed through a scalable platform, remains a powerful underpin of our earnings momentum in Asia. \r\nIn 2014, Eastspring attracted a record GBP 10.4 billion of third party- and internal-led flows, which together with positive market movements, drove assets under management to a new high of GBP 77 billion. Fee income increased by 20%, in line with the growth in average AUM. And with costs rising at a slower rate, the overall IFRS profit was 32% higher at GBP 90 million.\r\nIn the U.S., IFRS profit was up strongly at GBP 1,443 million, driven by a 21% increase in Jackson's life result. The improvements in Jackson's profitability has been accompanied by a positive evolution in the sources of earnings, with fee and technical income growing strongly, as shown in the chart in the top right. \r\nSpread income is only marginally up on last year, with reductions in crediting rates broadly matching the declines -- the decline in yield. As the headroom between current and guaranteed crediting rate levels is now small, a lower-for-longer interest rate scenario will see spread margin decline towards the 200 basis point level in the next 2 or 3 years. \r\nTechnical income benefited from an increased contribution from REALIC of GBP 216 million, up from GBP 178 million in the previous year. REALIC is now equivalent to 1/3 of the technical income block shown in blue.\r\nJackson's fastest-growing source was fee income, driven by the growth in separate account balances, which is illustrated in the chart in the bottom right. As you can see, the increase to $127 billion was mainly due to $12 billion of business inflows. Elite Access contributed $5 billion of this $12 billion and represented just over 8% of the separate account assets at the end of 2014. \r\nFinally, the profit from other U.S. operations is lower at GBP 12 million, reflecting the fee refunds in Curian, which we covered at the interims. \r\nTurning to the U.K. The improved performance was driven by the life result, which increased by 7% to GBP 752 million. This result was underpinned by a resilient contribution from our 2 core sources of with-profits and in-force annuities, which were not impacted by the U.K. market reforms.\r\nAlongside the rest of the market, sales of new individual annuities declined, reducing their contribution to profits from GBP 110 million to GBP 57 million. Bulks written on attractive economics added GBP 105 million to the total. We remain selective in our approach to the bulk annuity market, and we will only write the business where returns are sufficiently attractive. \r\nSo as we move forward, we think about the profitability of our UK Life business in 3 blocks. The first relates to the season and relatively stable results from with-profits and in-force annuities. The second relates to the contribution from new individual annuity business whose size will ultimately depend on how consumer demand for this product develops after April this year. And the third represents the profit from bulks, which will vary depending on the ongoing availability of sufficiently attractive deals.\r\nStaying in the U.K. and turning to M&G. IFRS operating profit was 13% higher at GBP 446 million, reflecting the growing scale of the business. As you can see in the box in the bottom right, assets under management increased to GBP 264 billion, driven by strong inflows and positive market movements. Within this total, retail AUM grew faster at 11%, reflecting M&G's success in Europe where it secured record net inflows of GBP 8.1 billion in 2014. \r\nThe higher overall level of AUM and the positive shift in business mix towards retail drove an 11% increase in fee income, which you can see in the box in the top right. \r\nM&G continues to invest in people and infrastructure to support the growth that we have seen in recent years. In 2014, the rising costs was outpaced by the higher level of fee revenues, driving a small improvement in the cost/income ratio to 58%. The rate of investment will continue for the foreseeable future, which will mean that this ratio could rise in the coming years.\r\nI will now move to free surplus, the primary measure of cash generation of our business. As you can see on the left, free surplus generation after investment in new business increased by 9% to GBP 2,579 million. The key component of this was the return from life in-force book, which was 19% higher at GBP 2,276 million. \r\nThis strong increase reflects the dynamic of adding another cohort of high-return, fast-payback new business on an already sizable back book. The GBP 314 million positive experience result reflected our ongoing success in managing the existing business for value. As I said last year, the comparative benefited from higher assumption changes, producing a result which was well above the run rate that we typically achieve. \r\nIn the top right, you can see that all 3 businesses are making significant contributions to the life in-force total, with a strong uplift in both Asia and Jackson where the high-return, fast-payback dynamic is most evident. The U.K. free surplus is lower as 2013 included GBP 78 million of positive longevity assumption change, which has not recurred. \r\nTotal new business strain was broadly unchanged at GBP 606 million. As you can see in the bottom right, Asia strain increased, reflecting higher sales volumes and changes in country mix. In the U.S., strain benefited from proactive actions on commissions and favorable changes in product mix, higher Elite Access, for example. The U.K.'s total new business strain includes GBP 31 million for bulks, which represents part of the extra investment that we said we would make in the U.K.\r\nThis next slide shows how the 2014 free surplus flow has impacted free surplus stock on the left and cash on the right. As you can see in the chart on the left, after deducting remittances, the overall stock is up at around GBP 5 billion. However, as our business is now bigger, the level of cover that this stock represents is broadly unchanged. \r\nOnce again, remittances have been strong across all businesses. The impact of sterling strength against Asian currencies is now beginning to come through in the remittances from Asia, and you should expect this effect to carry through into 2015. \r\nJackson's record remittance of GBP 415 million was the result of its disciplined approach to managing the balance between growth, value risk and capital. M&G's high remittance reflected growth in its overall earnings base. As previously flagged, the small decline in the U.K. remittance is due to the extra investment that we are making in response to the U.K. market reforms, which will continue through to 2016. As you're aware, remittances from our UK Life businesses are subject to regulatory approval. And notwithstanding the capital-generative nature of this business, I anticipate that securing approval will be more protracted this year as we transition from the old -- from the existing regulatory regime into the new one.\r\nFinally, on the right, you can see that after paying a higher dividend, funding the upfront fee for the renewal of the SCB distribution agreement and repaying $750 million denominated hybrid debt, we closed the year with GBP 1.5 billion of central cash, a very comfortable position. \r\nBefore leaving this topic, I wanted to reemphasize the reliability of our future cash generation by reference to the updated undiscounted risk monetization profile of our Life businesses. The dark blue bars in the top chart represent the end 2013 life in-force book monetization profile as we reported a year ago. The light blue bars represent the updated profile of this block 1 year later. These bars are now higher than before, reflecting positive experience and the effect of the stronger U.S. dollar, which taken together, have offset the impact of lower yield between the 2 periods. \r\nWhen we add the cash flows from the 2014 new business cohort shown in red, we have another profile that is higher than the one we started with, evidence of the powerful capital velocity capital dynamics of our business. We remain on track to deliver the GBP 10 billion cumulative free surplus objective after financing new business of the 2014 to 2017 full year period.\r\nI will now briefly cover the EEV results before turning to capital. On this basis, total operating profit was 4% higher at GBP 4,096 million, equivalent to a return on embedded value of 16%. As shown on the left, the result is driven by our combined life operations where profits were up at GBP 4,174 million, led by Asia. \r\nThe bar chart on the right analyzes the contribution to the life total from new business, which was up 10%, and from in-force, which was flat. As I mentioned at the start of my presentation, the decline in long-term yields during 2014 dampened our both new and in-force EEV results by an estimated GBP 90 million for new business and GBP 187 million for in-force. And this effect masks a strongly positive underlying trend. \r\nExperience profit, shown in the breakout box on the right, remained a prominent feature of our results, totaling GBP 470 million, while assumption changes were also positive at GBP 138 million. The fact that experience and assumption changes are positive in each of our 3 main businesses confirms the high quality of our franchise. \r\nNew business profit, shown on this next slide, increased by 10% to GBP 2,126 million, with all 3 businesses posting year-on-year improvement. You can see in the table on the right that this improvement is primarily driven by sales growth, offset by the adverse impact of lower interest rates. All 3 regions continued to write new business at very attractive internal rates of return of more than 20% in short payback periods. \r\nIn Asia, new business profit increased by 13% to GBP 1,162 million, primarily driven by the higher volumes from our expanding distribution capability. Our NBP performance in the region is both robust and resilient, underpinned by a 16% NBP increase from our Southeast Asia sweet spot and a 19% NBP increase from health and protection. \r\nIn the U.S., new business profit increased in line with sales. Product and pricing actions have depended on new business economics, which remain close to all-time highs despite the drag from the lower interest rate environment. \r\nU.K. NBP was 14% higher at GBP 270 million, supported by a strong contribution from bulk transactions in the year. Retail NBP was 23% lower due to a reduction in individual annuity sales, mitigated in part by higher NBP contribution from with-profit bonds.\r\nMoving now to the rest of the profit and loss account, which is summarized here for both reporting basis. In 2014, the impact of higher equity markets and lower long-term yields produced a number of offsetting effects within the IFRS investment variance line, which came to a negative GBP 0.3 billion. The more significant component in this line relates to Jackson. For the reasons that we have set out previously, the different accounting treatment on the movements in the valuation of derivatives and the corresponding guarantee reserves produced a net negative result, which has been a recurring feature of Jackson's results on this basis, reflecting imperfect IFRS accounting. We continue to hedge the risks of this business on an economic basis and accept the accounting volatility that ensues. \r\nAs we move down the table, we see a positive GBP 0.6 billion effect, reflecting unrealized gains on Jackson's fixed income securities following the declining yields. The stronger U.S. dollar at the end of 2014 also contributed positively. So after the payment of dividends, total IFRS net assets increased to GBP 11.6 billion, up 22% in the year. On an EEV basis, which does not suffer from the same limitations as IFRS in reflecting the full economic substance of market movements on our U.S. business, the overall investment variances were positive GBP 0.2 billion. Therefore under this basis, the strength of our operating performance, together with positive foreign exchange effect, net of dividends, produced a 17% increase in EEV net assets to GBP 29.2 billion, equivalent to an uplift of 165p to 1,136p per share. \r\nThe next few slides cover the group's economic capital position and our preparation for the implementation of Solvency II. We're now less than 1 year away from having to adopt Solvency II. However, there remains significant areas where policy clarifications are needed. We intend to apply for a full internal model in June and we will seek to incorporate Jackson using the equivalent  provisions. PRA internal model review, feedback and final approval is not expected until later this year, which means that we will only have full clarity on this topic once this entire process is completed.\r\nWe have updated the group's economic capital results, which are based on outputs from our internal model. Other than replacing the liquidity premium approach with the matching adjustment principles for U.K. annuities, these results have been produced using broadly the same methodology and assumptions as last year. So we continue to assume U.S. equivalents and have included Jackson's excess surplus above the 250% RBC level. Our methodology recognizes fully the value of overseas economic capital and incorporates a risk margin in line with the Solvency II requirements. \r\nNow based on this methodology and assumptions, our economic capital at the end of 2014 was GBP 9.7 billion, equivalent to a healthy cover of 218%. \r\nAs you can see on the right, our business operations delivered GBP 1.8 billion of economic capital in the year, equivalent to around 25 points of cover. As this capital measure is more market sensitive, the impact of the decline in U.K. interest rates is more pronounced, contributing to a negative movement of GBP 0.9 billion. So before capital actions and notwithstanding the adverse market effects, our business performance drove an overall increase in economic capital. \r\nThe remaining items, shown in light blue, reflect the impact of deploying our economic capital to renew our distribution agreement with SCB, repay hybrid debt, domesticate the Hong Kong business and pay the external dividend. The negative GBP 0.3 billion for model changes is mainly due to the impact of adopting the matching adjustment principles. So the key messages here are: one, that we are capital generative on this risk-sensitive metric, reaffirming the positive cash and capital dynamics of our business; two, that the overall reduction in the level of capital was principally driven by deliberate actions in pursuit of our strategy; and three, that our year-end position remains strong even in this historically low-yield environment. \r\nWe have updated the analysis of the economic risk profile of the business, which is broadly unchanged from last year and is not highly concentrated to any particular risk type. We have also updated the sensitivity of the end 2014 economic capital position to a range of market shocks, shown before the impact of potential management actions, and that's important. Even though the financial impact of these sensitivities is a little higher than the previous year, which is due to the lower end 2014 interest rate levels, the overall effect of these market stresses is manageable, reaffirming the resilience of our business model.\r\nBefore leaving this topic, I would reiterate that these results should not be interpreted as representing our Solvency II capital position. As I have already mentioned, policy remains unclear in a number of areas, while in others, it is ultimately subject to regulatory interpretation and supervisory judgment. We have provided you with some indicative sensitivities in your pack on 3 key areas under discussion based on completely, and I stress, completely hypothetical assumptions. These are: one, the impact of an artificial hair cut to Asia's economic capital contribution to the group total under the Solvency II fungibility tests, which as Tidjane has said, would not represent economic reality; two, the impact of calibrating U.K. credit and longevity 1 year stresses above levels that we would deem appropriate; and lastly, the offsetting effect of applying transitional relief in the U.K. for differences between the economic capital and the Solvency I Pillar 2 position. \r\nWhile we would expect the Solvency II result to be lower than the GBP 9.7 billion of economic capital, our starting point is strong, and our business remains highly capital generative in nature. This fundamental feature of our business is unaffected by Solvency II and underpins our confidence in the overall capital dynamics and capital position of the group.\r\nI have provided, on this next slide, the usual update on balance sheet. In summary, we remain well capitalized and defensively positioned. The group's IGD surplus at the end of the year is estimated at GBP 4.7 billion. And this is after deducting, in aggregate, GBP 1.3 billion for the full upfront fee of renewing the SCB agreement, the hybrid debt repayment and other corporate activity. The financial strength of the U.K. with-profits estate remains a core part of our product offering. And this stood at GBP 7.2 billion at the end of 2014, up from GBP 6.8 billion at the start of the year. \r\nThe U.S. RBC ratio has improved to 456% after covering the record cash remittance, underlying Jackson's disciplined approach to risk management. On this basis, the hedge program was essentially breakeven, as movements in hedge assets and guaranteed reserves broadly offset. And finally, in response to your requests, we have provided you with some additional disclosure on our exposure to oil and gas, which, in our view, is well contained, are properly diversified and focused on the high-quality names. For further details, please refer to the appendix slide. \r\nSo to summarize, we delivered a strong broad-based performance in 2014 against the challenging backdrop. The group remains highly cash generative, given by the predictable generation of free surplus from our growing life in-force book. Our capital position and conservative balance sheet remains a source of strength for our business and adds to our resilience. And finally, we are positive on the financial outlook of our business and have signaled our confidence in our future prospects through the 10% rebate in our full year dividend. I will now pass you back to Tidjane.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Cheick Thiam (Executives)】\nOkay. Well, thanks a lot, Nic. I'm now going to talk to you about the final part of this presentation, our outlook is positive and confident. And I'll start really with the basics. Where do we compete? Where are we? We think that we have an attractive footprint. As you know, we have 24 million customers across regions. And our footprint is really Asia, the U.S., the U.K. and [indiscernible] 2 spots in Africa, there we're starting. But we think that the point about this is if you look at new growth, not the stock of assets, our new growth where we are represent 63% of GDP growth expected in the next 5 years and that's a great place to be. But  presence alone is not a guarantee of success. It's a function of your capabilities and having the right strategy. \r\nWe believe we have the right strategy. In both geographic areas, we are focused on the right opportunities. It's the emerging middle-class in Asia, and it's savings and investment needs -- sorry, saving and protection needs, the U.S. baby boomers and transitioning into retirement and the U.K., which is a very attractive asset management and savings market. So if you look at the scale of those opportunities, the many, many assessment of the middle-class in Asia, but in our sweet spot, so just the sweet spot countries, Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, we expect the middle class to grow by more than 100 million in the decade between 2010 and '20, that is more than the entire population of the U.K. and we have 8 million customers in that space. So we think that the headroom is very, very significant. \r\nLook at the U.S., we expect 16 million more retirees in that same decade and that's more business for us. And if you look at the U.K., we think the assets under management to increase by to more than GBP 1 trillion over the same decade. And again, it's the second largest market in the world so we saw massive opportunities. \r\nWe have the capability and the execution to capture them, and that's really the next slide where we just give you the progression in our Health and Protection sales in Asia in 6 years that have more than doubled. If you look at the U.S., again, more than doubled in terms of sales and deposit by products, which you can also see the make-up has been transformed. VAs, which were smaller than fixed annuities, in the dark blue, in '08 are now more than 3x the volume of fixed annuities, that's again a transformation. And I could also talk about M&G and its success in the retail asset management market. \r\nBut all that, if it doesn't translate into tangible returns, it's not really meaningful. The good news is we haven't been able, through the disciplined execution, to grow that red bar, which is really the free surplus generation, to keep the blue bar going down, the new business strain under control, as the group gets bigger. In absolute terms, it hasn't really moved, which means that the light blue bar, to cash generative after new business strain has been growing very nicely, which has allowed us, and that's my, really, my final slide, to have a very nice slope of -- in the dividend and take it above the precrisis level, which for a financial services company is a good performance. \r\nSo to summarize and close and conclude. We are in the right places. We have the right strategy. The execution is good, 2014 was a good year. We have no intention to change the strategy. It served us very well. There's plenty of headroom. And Asia is at the center of all this, for very obvious reasons, it's more than 1/2 the world's population. It continues to grow. Even if the absolute growth rate may slow down on a relative basis is still a very, very high growth area. And we are uniquely positioned in Asia. We've got our distribution platform, our capabilities and our team to do well. Of course, we don't ignore the clouds on the horizon. Certainly, lower for longer. The low long-term interest rates, is a particular challenge for the industry but we think that we have effective responses for that. We have a strong balance sheet. \r\nNic and I have spent a lot of time talking to you about the cash generative nature of our business model and how that allows us to deal with the challenges of new Solvency models. And again, we believe that, that strong balance sheet leaves us well-positioned to deliver long-term shareholder value. So with that, I will stop. I will ask my Executive Director colleagues to join us on the podium here and we will start taking your question. \r\nRaghu, if you want to allocate the -- and Richard, yes.",
      "transcript_text3": "Okay. The usual drill, please. So state your name and your firm's name before asking the questions and the mic's going around.\n\n---\n\nGive them a chance to sit down then you can...\n\n---\n\nYes. Are we ready? Jon?\n\n---\n\nGood morning. It's Jon Hocking for Morgan Stanley. I've got 3 questions on capital, please. Just on the point about the overseas surpluses, are you including any surplus above 100% of local? Or are those numbers the same numbers that you've got in the free surplus calculation to EV? Second question, presumably this doesn't impact remittances, so this is purely an aggregation impact to group, so you might end up with lower group number than we might have hoped, but this is -- really has no impact. And then thirdly, on the credit longevity point you mentioned is that purely U.K. issues, is it U.K. annuity book issue? I should check on the fourth one. You presumably, you've got a lot of deck capacity, so you did end up with a low ratio, does that -- is that for easy solution to all of us?\n\n---\n\nOkay, thank you. Thank you, Jon. The agency credit longevity, well, we talked about that's U.K. I should have said U.K. It's exclusively U.K. Nic, you want to take the view overseas, overseas, where do we take them?\n\n---\n\nSure. I mean the overseas surplus and Solvency II is a completely different calculation. So what we do for our own free surplus calculation is we look at tangible assets and the extent to which those exceed more about -- on average about 130% of local minimum. That's the definition of free surplus, and the 130% is what we think across the region we need to hold relative to local minimum. Solvency II just looks through completely -- to completely different calculation. It allows you to put a realistic value on your reserves. And candidly, when you're talking about a lot of Health and Protection business, that realistic value uplift is significant. And it throws away the local requirements or an uplift on those and replaces them by a 100 to 200 stress which we then calibrate, taking each risk and modeling that out and applying the specification [ph] benefit. So net-net, Solvency II gives an answer that is bigger in terms of available capital or surplus in Asia than either taking 100% or the level that we apply. In reality, it doesn't change the distributions from Asia one jot. Why? Because those distributions will be determined by reference to the local regulatory regime, so Solvency II is interesting and it's relevant for Asia but it doesn't change the way we think about our business or indeed what capital can be remitted from that business. So therefore, whether there is a haircut or not against that, it doesn't affect. That's why we said it's uneconomic.\n\n---\n\nAnd that's the central point. So the remittances are driven by local solvency. We spent a lot of time building the local solvency to a level where capital can flow freely and it's not a constraint. So there is no connection there.\n\n---\n\nAnd to follow-up, in terms of the -- you mentioned the sensitivity in the press release but I haven't had the chance to take a look at the press release yet, so you're saying that even though these aren't equivalent regimes in nature, if your economic capital number recast on an economic basis, you're effectively including a larger economic solvency that might be down on a local regulatory basis?\n\n---\n\nYes. They're not equivalent regimes. We'd have to look through all of that and redo our calculation at this stage. They may become equivalent regimes in the future if the local regime evolves in some way. And as we saw at the visit in Asia earlier, we are -- they're 1 or 2 steps in that way over the next 5 or so years. So no, what we're bringing in is a completely different model. You asked a question on debt capacity, yes, with the repayment of debt, and of course, the increase in IFRS and embedded value, if you like, our gearing ratio whichever way you may want to calculate it has reduced. Yes, we have capacity to increase that. And we have done from time to time just increase the flexibility that we have at the group. It's another lever that we have. It's a great position to be in. If you have a growing business that flows our capital, yes, you can borrow against that. So we make those decisions as and when as we need the -- as necessary.\n\n---\n\nBlair, please.\n\n---\n\nThanks very much. It's Blair Stewart from BofA Merrill. A couple of questions, please. On the fungibility issues, I think you gave us 20% sensitivity in the pack. I just wonder if that's how we should read that 20% number. And wouldn't one answer to the fungibility concerns from the regulator be to change your policy in the way that you remit capital and just remit as much as you possibly can, rather than just what you need, just to prove the point on that issue? And your sensitivities on the economic capital to interest rates have broadly doubled, I think. Could you talk a little bit about that? Is it just a function of where rates are, have you changed the methodology there at all, please? And I guess Tidjane, I'll probably ask the inevitable question that, why -- because I'll be asked this question lots of times over the next few months but why are you leaving a big company like PRU to join a relatively small company like CS?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you, Blair. Okay. Fungibility, under sensitivity you gave?\n\n---\n\nI mean, I wanted to stress that they were completely hypothetical. I mean, candidly, until we go through the discussions, until we apply or formally apply for the internal model, I will mislead you if I said anything other than the fact that it's completely hypothetical. I want to reiterate that this is purely, I mean, I hesitate toward -- it's the fungibility test in Solvency II that says you must demonstrate on how you can remit this capital within a 9-month period. And it's quite an onerous test now. There's ways in which you can do that. Clearly, if you brought the money back, you'd avoid that, but candidly we need the money there to take advantage of the opportunities that exist in that, in those markets, so that wouldn't be a smart thing to do given the opportunities that are there to create value and generate more capital in the future.\n\n---\n\nBut on that just -- we have a data point on which you're preferring to, which is the '08, '09 crisis. So a lot of what Solvency II does is trying to mimic what would happen under stress. And we've got absolutely all the dividends we wanted out of Asia in '08 and '09, there's not a single dividend payment on the worst possible time. So this gives us high confidence that actually, that capital is accessible even under stress but from here is that we were assimilating a hypothetical event, and then it's easy to make extreme assumptions. But in the real life case, the capital has proven to be very fungible even under stress.\n\n---\n\nI mean the sensitivities we're talking about onerous sensitivities here. So just to give you an example, 40% shock on markets, that's 40% on top of the 100 and 200, that's a 70% market decline just to put a sense of perspective as to what these things represent, interest rates, interest rates is entirely, yes, the 50 basis points sensitivity that we give on interest rates, particularly saying in the U.K. that's after 130 basis points reduction. Where the effect is most significant is -- at those levels of interest is the value of the future with profit transfer, so that's what's driving the additional volatility there but notwithstanding, the point that I made earlier and I reiterate now, is that even taking further reductions in yields from this very historically low interest rate environment, the overall position is safe.\n\n---\n\nLast one was for me. Okay, where do I start? I know that Africans have a better reputation but I -- pardon me make that joke. I never had an ambition of being CEO for life. We have presidents for life in Africa, so it's a -- I was always going to leave, so let's start with that someday. So the question becomes when. When you're a CEO it's something, it's probably one of the most difficult calls you have to make, knowing when to leave. And for me, when to leave is the time when everything is going well, okay. You don't want to leave when there are issues to solve, businesses to restructure, things to deal with because that is what I think unsettles the markets the least and leads to the least suspicion. I'm leaving after our best year ever. And I will be here to talk about Q1 and you will be able to see the businesses is going sideways or slowing down. I can tell you it's not. So that is really the best moment to leave if you were a CEO and if you want to not for a hospital pass, it's an expression I've learned in the U.K., to your successor. So that's one. Two, I've always had a -- someone on my team was reminding me that I always talk about 5 years. I really think that's a kind of very natural cycle. It's just not good, it's not healthy. Sorry, I'm going to come back to my favorite topic, Arsenal. It's not healthy to stay too long. It doesn't matter how successful you've been. I'm going to say -- I was going to say that always because you see, it's just stuck in my throat. When you're 19 of Mr. you know who, so that's not a model to follow. So you have to know when to kind of gracefully bow and move on and do something else, so that is really the core of the answer, then where I go is the function of opportunities, et cetera. Another talk about Credit Suisse at this stage [indiscernible] would be inappropriate, but I can answer the first one, former question which is why leave now and I have built a good team. It takes a few years, I think took 5, 6 years. That was announced in March '09, and you were here 6 years ago. I think I'm leaving a great team behind and I'm very confident in the prospects of the company. I've\r\nnever believed that I was irreplaceable. We say in French, the cemeteries are full with irreplaceable people, so I will be replaced and very well.\n\n---\n\nGreig.\n\n---\n\nGood morning, everyone. Greig Paterson, KBW. Congratulations on your performance the last few years. I know we butt heads back and forth a few times, but I think it's been very successful, so, well done. Just 3 questions. One is DBS coming up for renewal this year, I just wondered if you want to talk about your appetite for big bulk deals, the distribution deals in Asia. Second thing, just in terms of Standard Chartered, the new deal, I was wondering if we are up at the sort of terminal run rate now. In other words, you've rolled out in all the regions or is there still some coming through in the next few months as you fully bed down that deal? I'm just trying to understand where we are in the trajectory. And in terms of the U.S. remittances, if I recall there was some issue around business mix VA versus fixed annuities and the rating agencies, and that was more of a concern on Solvency II and to their local staff and whatever. I just want to -- wonder if you can talk about the prospects for remittances and how it fits in the context of the rating agency model. And so -- and it is not a question, just a clarification, Nic. When you're talking about the 130x local, were you talking about IGD basis or an economic model? Sorry?\n\n---\n\nIt's the free surplus basis.\n\n---\n\nSo that's what you're currently using in your eco-capital model?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Greig, I'm glad you didn't take personally my constant teasing of you over the years. I ask for forgiveness on that. But DBS, you know we never comment on M&A situations, whether we never confirm or deny or say anything, so we won't say anything specific about DBS but the general appetite for deals and SCB, Barry, you want to take that?\n\n---\n\nSure. I mean, we -- one of our strengths obviously is that we have the largest most productive and most diverse distribution platform in Asia, in the industry in Asia. Obviously, our intention is to continue to build upon that existing strength and make it stronger and stronger still. So do we want distribution deals? Of course, we want distribution deals. Do we need them? We do not. We've already got a market-leading position in terms of scale and quality. So what that means is, the -- getting a deal, any particular deal or not getting that deal is not existential to us. We will continue to do well no matter what. And therefore, it comes down to economics, where the economics are rational, where the partner gets a sense that based upon our track record of success, that we'd be the best partner. Then -- and the chemistry's right between the 2 partners, that's a perfect combination. We usually get those deals and we usually do well with those deals. The best evidence of that is SCB, which continues to go from strength to strength. As we've told you, the half-year point, the 7 1 kind of reboot of that relationship for another 15 years was really a pivotal moment because it sort of re-energized both teams and the level of cooperation has been extraordinary, the chemistry between the teams, both at a global and at a local level, which has always been good, it's even better. Ideas that have been talked about for the last few years is interesting ideas in terms of how to expand the business for the bank and for us are now being put into action. So I think the simple answer to your question is you should expect to continue to see very good performance out of SCB. I'm very optimistic.\n\n---\n\nI think there was a question on the run rate. Do you feel that you have some headroom over which the stable run rates on SCB? I think he was asking.\n\n---\n\nI thought I answered it. No?\n\n---\n\nWell, I'm coming back for more. Greig...\n\n---\n\nAre you -- should you be sitting down there?\n\n---\n\nI know Greig. I know Greig.\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nThere's more under -- more new initiatives underway, so I think you should be as optimistic as I am.\n\n---\n\nI just wanted to get you on the hook. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThanks.\n\n---\n\nU.S. mix, VA, FA, between Michael or Nic.\n\n---\n\nI think it matters by rating agencies for one. They have different views of it and they look at now -- the dialogue we have with them is the various risk levels and the various types of VA we've written. So I think it's a little different discussion for us and a carrier with the single product when they go in. I think the rating agencies are certainly more conservative post crisis. The other process has changed. It's much more scripted and structured. They have less latitude, I think, for judgment, so there is a little bit more of a formula that I think we're fine on. It's not a -- that wouldn't be a remittance issue for us. The remittance discussion will be with the regulators at the state level, New York and Michigan.\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nYou notice I'm not answering that.\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nIt is -- you see the recurring nature of the revenue question is what we do in country, all the normal variables we'd look at in a given year, so, but the resilience, projections, earnings, it's clearly there.\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely. Okay. Thank you. Who's next?\n\n---\n\nGood morning it's Lance Burbidge from Autonomous. Two questions, first one for Mike. I was wondering if you might comment on what the White House has been saying on purchase of retirement products in the past couple of weeks. And secondly for Barry on Indonesia. Indonesia obviously had a very good December, is there any kind of idea you can give us in terms of how active your agency force is at that point, and sort of how much capacity you have to see that growing rapidly?\n\n---\n\nOkay. So Mike you go on with...\n\n---\n\nThis is actually initiated in the Department of Labor about, I would say, 2.5 years ago at first, and I think -- and the White House is -- now has the documents. So what we're understanding is somewhere in the next 60 to 90 days, the released comment -- Office Management Budget, there will be a financial impact of the normal comment period. And then we'll see what we have. It is -- I think the academic work that was done to support the argument that something's not -- that there's not a value to the advice is always difficult because how invested would those -- what percentage of equities would those clients have had if they made the choices by themselves. And I can tell you we're dealing with advisers every month. What they will tell you is they get clients to invest when they won't and they get them to sell when they won't. And it's not -- that's a new concept. I mean, that's the same thing you'd see with advice in Asia, the U.K. or any place else. They get clients to manage risk levels prudently. I don't think the work that was published shows that. I think it shows if you bought a fund, perfectly timed ETF purchase versus bought a load fund with advice, what's the net difference, and so that's sort of, I think, the mistake in the core premise of it. But you also see the SEC pushing back on -- they see this as their enforcement jurisdiction and no, I don't think they share the mandate at this point. So I think we're going to see a lot of comment on it, a lot of discussion. I think the counter is going to be -- it's a very well-governed market, heavy disclosure, you'll probably get a little tightening of the movement from suitability, which is the U.S. standard towards best advice, which is more what you used to see, the reasons why letters and things, there isn't that concept really in the States. You see it with the SEC advisers a bit but you're probably see a more of a hybrid of the 2. And if I was guessing, that's where it will land but it will be an industry issue for 6 to 9 months at least.\n\n---\n\nAnd if I may just add 1 thing. There's a bit of good news actually in all these which is, and we met some of the White House people, they have examined commissions and decided not to touch that, and they mentioned how they are something they looked at, was not a success, and that they didn't want to imitate.\n\n---\n\nThe early draft of the language as we understood it would have barred all commissions on retirement products, and again, but would have allowed advisory fees. So this -- the details of when this will matter, and I would tell you from Jackson's point of view, if it requires a change in product or structure or distribution, I think we're better situated than any of our competitors to address that quickly and effectively. And I think you're going to need systems capability, you're going to need sophisticated delivery or whatever the new structure is, technology, et cetera, and we have those capabilities.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Mike. Barry, Indonesia activity?\n\n---\n\nYes. The short answer is that December was a great month, and obviously, the number of active agents spiked a bit. So that was very important. We couldn't have produced those numbers without that having happened. The dynamic that's been happening throughout the year is, last year, as we had sort of this consumer uncertainty, and then the natural disaster issue with the flooding and so forth as well, is really that we were taking longer to activate new agents. And as you know, the agency model there, a lot of the production, a material part of production is dependent upon our ability to quickly activate new agents who are being recruited. And that's really the metric where we were struggling, that it's slowed down, and that did pick up significantly in December. So I don't think we're at a point where we can declare a victory. Obviously, Tidjane alluded to the political environment there. It is -- people are more optimistic, I think, generally speaking, based on what the -- Jokowi has been able to accomplish so far. He's taken the hard decisions. As he said, he would so, I mean, that's, I think, calls for optimism. But I don't think we're in a position we could declare a victory, but we're hopeful about 2015.\n\n---\n\nWhere do we go?\n\n---\n\nGordon?\n\n---\n\nGordon.\n\n---\n\nIt's Gordon Aitken from RBC. A couple of questions for Mike and one for Jackie. Mike, you were very open about your desire for M&A within Jackson. And you said back in December, the market was quite tough in terms of PE having lower hurdle rates. Can you update us on the market? I'm not asking about specifics about the market there. And secondly, and it's related, why do you need to acquire? I mean, if Jackson remains within the PRU Group and you have lots of diversity. Admittedly, if Jackson standalone, it leaves us exposed to VAs. And the third question for Jackie is, you had a competitor saying, in bulks they were quoting on GBP 10 billion of bulks, at this current point in time, what's your expectation for the market issue we've got? Some people are saying it's a GBP 10 billion market, that's the new norm, other people are saying GBP 100 billion over 5 years. What do you think?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Mike, do you want to start?\n\n---\n\nGordon, on the M&A, I think the market remains competitive. The participants are a number of U.S. insurers and foreign insurers said they'd like to buy something you have. Private equity, that's opportunistic where I just wanted to do a single transaction and hand it to third party administrator to run, and they see it as sort of -- they tend to like the annuity deals because they see those fixed annuities as a sort of levered play on bonds. The model being stripped to capital out and run up the risk in the portfolio and just about everything the regulator doesn't want to hear. And the third is now you have private equity firms that have actually built platforms in the U.S. where they can -- they're building competitive insurance companies to consolidate, so those are the 3 types of buyers. You have the hybrids of that, [indiscernible] and things. So that's the competitive landscape. It's a great point of diversification globally. We absolutely have that as part of the group but there's actually pretty good opportunity for our shareholders when we do these purchases. We can take a lot of the expenses out of a competing life company and get materially higher returns than if we wrote a life policy individually. And it's also I think a lower risk transaction. You get away from some of the first and second-year risks when writing a life policy in the States. But the actual returns we've got on the life, the blocks we've done have been excellent for shareholders. It goes to our expense base. It goes to the technology. It goes to the service model. It's all scalable and as shareholders, you own capacity in the States and we're just utilizing some of that. So I think that's the other reason to do it.\n\n---\n\nAnd on the bulk pipeline, we continue to see it as an attractive market. Overall, we think it's about 1.8 trillion of liabilities looking for a home. If you look at the pipeline coming into this year, it has been incredibly strong, simply stronger than I've ever seen it. We will, however, continue to be selective. We've talked about being disciplined and we genuinely are disciplined. We look at the opportunities, not just in terms of the financial hurdle rates and the return in that way, but also the amount of capital consumed on various basis. So you should expect to see us active in the market but very selective about the deals that we choose to undertake.\n\n---\n\nJust being conscious of time, we'll take a couple of more.\n\n---\n\nOliver Steel with Deutsche Bank. Three questions. The first is Elite Access, we're seeing quite a lot of a lot-like competitors, so I'm wondering what the competitive landscape is there and what advantage you still have over the competitors. Secondly, I wondered if you could just give us a bit more insight into where the SCB sort of premium increases come through. I mean, Hong Kong, fairly obviously, but perhaps you can talk to the other countries as well and where the opportunities still are. And then thirdly, Nic talked about the U.K. regulator taking a bit longer to agree to any cash transfer from the U.K. business, so I was just wondering what the issues were in that regard.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you, Oliver. Competition for Elite Access, Mike? A short answer.\n\n---\n\nThe short answer, there's a dozen or more. I think there's 2 more filed. With our GBP 5 billion and change of sales last year, I think the most successful #2 product was in the 200s, with 70% of their sales being in their own agency force and in country. It is -- one of the things I'm most proud of with Elite Access is it is -- if you were trying to measure Jackson's capability, I think it's an excellent example of -- you need a product alignment, the design, the training. Jackson was named yesterday in one of the industry trades, BlackRock, us, and I apologize, but one other firm as providing writing the best training to advisors in the alt space period, not just the VA space. And I think the formula behind it, of building a good product, understanding the client, et cetera, and being able to help the adviser work it into the business model, that last piece is incredibly difficult. And I think that's where the competitors are having the most trouble. They're building -- well, the category is called IOVAs now, Investment Only VAs, and they're immediately adding guarantees to them. And so they're no longer IO -- so they're IOVAs with guarantees now, I guess. This is just going to continue to go to the industry's default high commission to a guarantee on it model, we're not. And it's a good investment product. And if you think of the alt returns expectations you would have, this is not a product that can support a superheavy fee load, it doesn't have the S&P kind of upside to it, so you've got to -- I think the industry's got to be careful here not to commission themselves into a product that doesn't work for the consumers.\n\n---\n\nUnless it's [indiscernible] because really Mike is being modest, but the level of success achieved by Jackson, and this is compared to the competition, is extremely impressive. I mean, GBP 5 million to GBP 200 million, it's impressive. Standard Chartered, where did the growth come from?\n\n---\n\nIt's -- if you look at just what happened in the second half of the year, particularly towards the end of the year, it's actually quite broad-based. Hong Kong, which has always been the largest market, did really well. The relationship in Hong Kong in December, to give you an idea, was up 37%. You might be shocked to hear that Korea has done really well. In fact -- and I'm almost reluctant to give you this number but in December Korea was up 633% for SCB.\n\n---\n\nIt's probably from a low base.\n\n---\n\nYes. It's a relatively low base. I think -- 600 policies versus the 1 we sold last year but -- and Taiwan has done well. Now Taiwan and Korea are lumpy because it's really -- there, the bank market in those 2 countries features a lot of hot money product, which we won't do. And so generally what happens is, our sales in Taiwan, and particularly in Korea, tend to spike when all of the local competitors, who manufacture the hot money products that run out of capital, and there's nowhere else to go. And then they come to us and we sell them a sensible product. So it's a little bit lumpy. But the Hong Kong story is a strong and continuing and durable story, as is the story in Singapore. We're making good traction in the markets where banca is still not as big like Malaysia is an example. One of the real shining stars post-renewal of the SCB deal, however, is really India where we did not have a relationship until we signed the new agreement, which was effective on July 1. They had -- were fully active on July 1. They got into every branch and have just done an amazing job of some specific products that are very appealing, some -- using technology. It's 100% paperless process. It's all done on iPads. It's really quite clever. And interestingly from a standing start, India went from 0 to our #4 market within the context of SCB, so a very strong start there.\n\n---\n\nU.K., U.K. dividends?\n\n---\n\nI mean, the simple answer is that there is still too much up in the air. I mean, if I can give you some examples around that, I mean, matching adjustment is a completely new set of a new approach. You're having to think through eligibility. You have to think through cost of defaults, the cost of migration in relation to downgrades. I hope our guidance in terms of the base has only emerged in the last week and every week that goes by, you see some more guidance emerge laterally around some of the criteria around the asset liability matching and so on and so forth. All that needs to play out. We're participating in the pre-application process and are matching adjustments and we will [indiscernible] in the second quarter. Longevity. In longevity, we're moving away from a runoff test which is the way in which ICA has been underpinned. To a 1 year test then you're trying to effectively establish a capital amount that says how would you change your longevity reserves based on any information that might evolve in the year and then how do you apply 100 or 200 stress on that. So it's a completely new way of looking at things with no precedent in a 1-year context. And then luckily, lastly, the application of the risk margin is quite onerous. Again, just to give you an example, if you took, at the end of 2014 interest rates, if you took the combined effect of risk margin and SCR, that would be equivalent to around 15% of annuity reserves. That is much higher than what you're currently required to do under ICA, which brings transitionals straight into scope. They were designed exactly to do that, to give you relief, where Solvency II comes up with an answer that is different to ICA. The whole process about how you go about securing transitional relief is still up in the air. So all I was flagging is there's a lot up in the air. I mean, it will be wrong of me to sit here and say, in a year of transition with so many questions outstanding, I'd be wrong not to flag a risk that the discussions will take longer. Now the key, though, point is that the business is growing out capital. So that's key and it's the same across all of the businesses.\n\n---\n\nAnd if I can just add to it. If you step back, what I want to put on record, I said it in my notes, is that the dialogue with the regulator is good and constructive. I insist on that. We found a very receptive regulator and we're engaged in a -- Paul and I went to see them and all issues on the table, and we're all working towards a solution. That's one. Two, again, back to a capital generative comment, and stress testing the dividend. We always tell you we stress test the dividend, the group dividend. One of the scenarios we look at is what if the U.K. didn't pay any dividend for 3 years or 4 years? And I can tell you the dividend is sustainable. It can continue to grow at 5% even under those scenarios, and part of why we're always so cautious and when we -- rebates for -- we look at all those scenarios, and we give you an upward rebase that is robust and that will basically survive under any scenario, and that's really important. And the final point on the remittances is they are not actually that important because, as Nic said, if the business is cash generative, if for any reason, you stop paying from any business, you're building up very quickly a position of that business after 2 or 3 years, the capital fell [ph] through again because whatever punctual [ph] tension there is resolved. And that's why the system is very safe as a whole because if you're running 4 cash generative businesses, you can't ever really get in trouble. All you have, the timing differences. I insist on that. And that's why we feel so confident in the group dividend. It would -- just the timing difference, nothing more. Next question?\n\n---\n\nFinal question.\n\n---\n\nJust a couple of question. First of all on your economic capital required, required capital movement, what actually drove the GBP 1 billion increase? I guess it's not the U.S. rates because you are treating U.S. on equivalence, it should not really impact the required capital. What really moved that? That's the first thing. And secondly, you showed the GBP 1.8 billion of capital generation on economic capital basis. Again, can we get more color on how much of that is coming out of U.S., because as U.S. is on the equivalence basis, how does that move? I mean, should we think about EV basis of economic capital generation? Or it's a different metric altogether?\n\n---\n\nAll right. Thanks, Ashik. Nic, [indiscernible] for you. You could obviously say no...\n\n---\n\nNot on the EVs, you're absolutely right that [indiscernible] increased from 7.2 to 8.2. 1/3 of that, roughly, 1/3 is the model changes, the matching adjustment, for example, goes straight to the delta of 0.3 that I referenced, go straight to the denominator. 1/3 of that comes from literally business growth, as you put more business on to your book then it requires you to put some capital. And the other 1/3 comes roughly from FX. A lot of the required capital sits outside the U.K., and therefore, when the currency moves, that has an impact. Yes, there is some market effects but that's relatively de minimis. The GBP 1.8 billion, I mean, we bring in the U.S. from effectively the local RBC, above the GBP 250 million. I don't have the math in my head but we do give you a slide that shows the movements in the available capital in the U.S. at the back of the pack starting from the opening start position plus generation, albeit with market effect less dividend. And I think you can use that to broadly calculate it. So that's a good way of bringing that in, but of course, that's capital generation excess GBP 100 million, to excess GBP 250 million.\n\n---\n\nOkay, very good. Well, I think this brings this morning to a close. Since this is probably the last time I do a --  allow me to make a few closing remarks. Mike reminded me that he served under 5 CEOs at PRU, that I'm the longest-serving, so I'm quite pleased, for all the questions. So I'm quite pleased about the total questions on the way now. It's been a real privilege and honor to lead this company, it's a great company. And we have a great team, I've said that several times today. I took -- I think the day I was appointed, we closed at GBP 2.52. I don't know where we are today but it starts with the GBP 16 so I won't claim the credit for that because a lot of that -- I talk about hospital pass but I was appointed at an interesting time, so some of that is just crisis being resolved, some of that is really the merit of this team, and it's been a great ride. So I just want to thank all of you. I know that over the years, we've had many, many meetings, many discussions. So we won't have gotten where we are without your support, your interest in the company and your understanding. Just 2 more points. One, it may surprise you, but I want to, on record, acknowledge someone who's a fierce competitor of ours, that is Mark Tucker who gave me a great opportunity here. And I want to put it on record and express my gratitude to him, something I owe him. And finally, just to say that you shouldn't stop loving Pru. It's a great company and it has a phenomenal team. So thank you very much.",
      "transcript_text4": "【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nOkay. The usual drill, please. So state your name and your firm's name before asking the questions and the mic's going around.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nGive them a chance to sit down then you can...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nYes. Are we ready? Jon?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jon Hocking (Analysts)】\nGood morning. It's Jon Hocking for Morgan Stanley. I've got 3 questions on capital, please. Just on the point about the overseas surpluses, are you including any surplus above 100% of local? Or are those numbers the same numbers that you've got in the free surplus calculation to EV? Second question, presumably this doesn't impact remittances, so this is purely an aggregation impact to group, so you might end up with lower group number than we might have hoped, but this is -- really has no impact. And then thirdly, on the credit longevity point you mentioned is that purely U.K. issues, is it U.K. annuity book issue? I should check on the fourth one. You presumably, you've got a lot of deck capacity, so you did end up with a low ratio, does that -- is that for easy solution to all of us?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nOkay, thank you. Thank you, Jon. The agency credit longevity, well, we talked about that's U.K. I should have said U.K. It's exclusively U.K. Nic, you want to take the view overseas, overseas, where do we take them?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicolaos Nicandrou (Executives)】\nSure. I mean the overseas surplus and Solvency II is a completely different calculation. So what we do for our own free surplus calculation is we look at tangible assets and the extent to which those exceed more about -- on average about 130% of local minimum. That's the definition of free surplus, and the 130% is what we think across the region we need to hold relative to local minimum. Solvency II just looks through completely -- to completely different calculation. It allows you to put a realistic value on your reserves. And candidly, when you're talking about a lot of Health and Protection business, that realistic value uplift is significant. And it throws away the local requirements or an uplift on those and replaces them by a 100 to 200 stress which we then calibrate, taking each risk and modeling that out and applying the specification [ph] benefit. So net-net, Solvency II gives an answer that is bigger in terms of available capital or surplus in Asia than either taking 100% or the level that we apply. In reality, it doesn't change the distributions from Asia one jot. Why? Because those distributions will be determined by reference to the local regulatory regime, so Solvency II is interesting and it's relevant for Asia but it doesn't change the way we think about our business or indeed what capital can be remitted from that business. So therefore, whether there is a haircut or not against that, it doesn't affect. That's why we said it's uneconomic.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Cheick Thiam (Executives)】\nAnd that's the central point. So the remittances are driven by local solvency. We spent a lot of time building the local solvency to a level where capital can flow freely and it's not a constraint. So there is no connection there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jon Hocking (Analysts)】\nAnd to follow-up, in terms of the -- you mentioned the sensitivity in the press release but I haven't had the chance to take a look at the press release yet, so you're saying that even though these aren't equivalent regimes in nature, if your economic capital number recast on an economic basis, you're effectively including a larger economic solvency that might be down on a local regulatory basis?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicolaos Nicandrou (Executives)】\nYes. They're not equivalent regimes. We'd have to look through all of that and redo our calculation at this stage. They may become equivalent regimes in the future if the local regime evolves in some way. And as we saw at the visit in Asia earlier, we are -- they're 1 or 2 steps in that way over the next 5 or so years. So no, what we're bringing in is a completely different model. You asked a question on debt capacity, yes, with the repayment of debt, and of course, the increase in IFRS and embedded value, if you like, our gearing ratio whichever way you may want to calculate it has reduced. Yes, we have capacity to increase that. And we have done from time to time just increase the flexibility that we have at the group. It's another lever that we have. It's a great position to be in. If you have a growing business that flows our capital, yes, you can borrow against that. So we make those decisions as and when as we need the -- as necessary.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nBlair, please.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Blair Stewart (Analysts)】\nThanks very much. It's Blair Stewart from BofA Merrill. A couple of questions, please. On the fungibility issues, I think you gave us 20% sensitivity in the pack. I just wonder if that's how we should read that 20% number. And wouldn't one answer to the fungibility concerns from the regulator be to change your policy in the way that you remit capital and just remit as much as you possibly can, rather than just what you need, just to prove the point on that issue? And your sensitivities on the economic capital to interest rates have broadly doubled, I think. Could you talk a little bit about that? Is it just a function of where rates are, have you changed the methodology there at all, please? And I guess Tidjane, I'll probably ask the inevitable question that, why -- because I'll be asked this question lots of times over the next few months but why are you leaving a big company like PRU to join a relatively small company like CS?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Cheick Thiam (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you, Blair. Okay. Fungibility, under sensitivity you gave?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicolaos Nicandrou (Executives)】\nI mean, I wanted to stress that they were completely hypothetical. I mean, candidly, until we go through the discussions, until we apply or formally apply for the internal model, I will mislead you if I said anything other than the fact that it's completely hypothetical. I want to reiterate that this is purely, I mean, I hesitate toward -- it's the fungibility test in Solvency II that says you must demonstrate on how you can remit this capital within a 9-month period. And it's quite an onerous test now. There's ways in which you can do that. Clearly, if you brought the money back, you'd avoid that, but candidly we need the money there to take advantage of the opportunities that exist in that, in those markets, so that wouldn't be a smart thing to do given the opportunities that are there to create value and generate more capital in the future.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nBut on that just -- we have a data point on which you're preferring to, which is the '08, '09 crisis. So a lot of what Solvency II does is trying to mimic what would happen under stress. And we've got absolutely all the dividends we wanted out of Asia in '08 and '09, there's not a single dividend payment on the worst possible time. So this gives us high confidence that actually, that capital is accessible even under stress but from here is that we were assimilating a hypothetical event, and then it's easy to make extreme assumptions. But in the real life case, the capital has proven to be very fungible even under stress.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicolaos Nicandrou (Executives)】\nI mean the sensitivities we're talking about onerous sensitivities here. So just to give you an example, 40% shock on markets, that's 40% on top of the 100 and 200, that's a 70% market decline just to put a sense of perspective as to what these things represent, interest rates, interest rates is entirely, yes, the 50 basis points sensitivity that we give on interest rates, particularly saying in the U.K. that's after 130 basis points reduction. Where the effect is most significant is -- at those levels of interest is the value of the future with profit transfer, so that's what's driving the additional volatility there but notwithstanding, the point that I made earlier and I reiterate now, is that even taking further reductions in yields from this very historically low interest rate environment, the overall position is safe.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Cheick Thiam (Executives)】\nLast one was for me. Okay, where do I start? I know that Africans have a better reputation but I -- pardon me make that joke. I never had an ambition of being CEO for life. We have presidents for life in Africa, so it's a -- I was always going to leave, so let's start with that someday. So the question becomes when. When you're a CEO it's something, it's probably one of the most difficult calls you have to make, knowing when to leave. And for me, when to leave is the time when everything is going well, okay. You don't want to leave when there are issues to solve, businesses to restructure, things to deal with because that is what I think unsettles the markets the least and leads to the least suspicion. I'm leaving after our best year ever. And I will be here to talk about Q1 and you will be able to see the businesses is going sideways or slowing down. I can tell you it's not. So that is really the best moment to leave if you were a CEO and if you want to not for a hospital pass, it's an expression I've learned in the U.K., to your successor. So that's one. Two, I've always had a -- someone on my team was reminding me that I always talk about 5 years. I really think that's a kind of very natural cycle. It's just not good, it's not healthy. Sorry, I'm going to come back to my favorite topic, Arsenal. It's not healthy to stay too long. It doesn't matter how successful you've been. I'm going to say -- I was going to say that always because you see, it's just stuck in my throat. When you're 19 of Mr. you know who, so that's not a model to follow. So you have to know when to kind of gracefully bow and move on and do something else, so that is really the core of the answer, then where I go is the function of opportunities, et cetera. Another talk about Credit Suisse at this stage [indiscernible] would be inappropriate, but I can answer the first one, former question which is why leave now and I have built a good team. It takes a few years, I think took 5, 6 years. That was announced in March '09, and you were here 6 years ago. I think I'm leaving a great team behind and I'm very confident in the prospects of the company. I've\r\nnever believed that I was irreplaceable. We say in French, the cemeteries are full with irreplaceable people, so I will be replaced and very well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nGreig.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Greig Paterson (Analysts)】\nGood morning, everyone. Greig Paterson, KBW. Congratulations on your performance the last few years. I know we butt heads back and forth a few times, but I think it's been very successful, so, well done. Just 3 questions. One is DBS coming up for renewal this year, I just wondered if you want to talk about your appetite for big bulk deals, the distribution deals in Asia. Second thing, just in terms of Standard Chartered, the new deal, I was wondering if we are up at the sort of terminal run rate now. In other words, you've rolled out in all the regions or is there still some coming through in the next few months as you fully bed down that deal? I'm just trying to understand where we are in the trajectory. And in terms of the U.S. remittances, if I recall there was some issue around business mix VA versus fixed annuities and the rating agencies, and that was more of a concern on Solvency II and to their local staff and whatever. I just want to -- wonder if you can talk about the prospects for remittances and how it fits in the context of the rating agency model. And so -- and it is not a question, just a clarification, Nic. When you're talking about the 130x local, were you talking about IGD basis or an economic model? Sorry?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicolaos Nicandrou (Executives)】\nIt's the free surplus basis.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Greig Paterson (Analysts)】\nSo that's what you're currently using in your eco-capital model?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicolaos Nicandrou (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nThank you, Greig, I'm glad you didn't take personally my constant teasing of you over the years. I ask for forgiveness on that. But DBS, you know we never comment on M&A situations, whether we never confirm or deny or say anything, so we won't say anything specific about DBS but the general appetite for deals and SCB, Barry, you want to take that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Barry Stowe (Executives)】\nSure. I mean, we -- one of our strengths obviously is that we have the largest most productive and most diverse distribution platform in Asia, in the industry in Asia. Obviously, our intention is to continue to build upon that existing strength and make it stronger and stronger still. So do we want distribution deals? Of course, we want distribution deals. Do we need them? We do not. We've already got a market-leading position in terms of scale and quality. So what that means is, the -- getting a deal, any particular deal or not getting that deal is not existential to us. We will continue to do well no matter what. And therefore, it comes down to economics, where the economics are rational, where the partner gets a sense that based upon our track record of success, that we'd be the best partner. Then -- and the chemistry's right between the 2 partners, that's a perfect combination. We usually get those deals and we usually do well with those deals. The best evidence of that is SCB, which continues to go from strength to strength. As we've told you, the half-year point, the 7 1 kind of reboot of that relationship for another 15 years was really a pivotal moment because it sort of re-energized both teams and the level of cooperation has been extraordinary, the chemistry between the teams, both at a global and at a local level, which has always been good, it's even better. Ideas that have been talked about for the last few years is interesting ideas in terms of how to expand the business for the bank and for us are now being put into action. So I think the simple answer to your question is you should expect to continue to see very good performance out of SCB. I'm very optimistic.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Cheick Thiam (Executives)】\nI think there was a question on the run rate. Do you feel that you have some headroom over which the stable run rates on SCB? I think he was asking.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Barry Stowe (Executives)】\nI thought I answered it. No?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tidjane Thiam (Executives)】\nWell, I'm coming back for more. Greig...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Barry Stowe (Executives)】\nAre you -- should you be sitting down there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Cheick Thiam (Executives)】\nI know Greig. I know Greig.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Greig Paterson (Analysts)】\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【回答: Barry Stowe (Executives)】\nThere's more under -- more new initiatives underway, so I think you should be as optimistic as I am.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Cheick Thiam (Executives)】\nI just wanted to get you on the hook. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Barry Stowe (Executives)】\nThanks.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Cheick Thiam (Executives)】\nU.S. mix, VA, FA, between Michael or Nic.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Wells (Executives)】\nI think it matters by rating agencies for one. They have different views of it and they look at now -- the dialogue we have with them is the various risk levels and the various types of VA we've written. So I think it's a little different discussion for us and a carrier with the single product when they go in. I think the rating agencies are certainly more conservative post crisis. The other process has changed. It's much more scripted and structured. They have less latitude, I think, for judgment, so there is a little bit more of a formula that I think we're fine on. It's not a -- that wouldn't be a remittance issue for us. The remittance discussion will be with the regulators at the state level, New York and Michigan.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Greig Paterson (Analysts)】\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【回答: Barry Stowe (Executives)】\nYou notice I'm not answering that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Greig Paterson (Analysts)】\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【回答: Barry Stowe (Executives)】\nIt is -- you see the recurring nature of the revenue question is what we do in country, all the normal variables we'd look at in a given year, so, but the resilience, projections, earnings, it's clearly there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Cheick Thiam (Executives)】\nAbsolutely. Okay. Thank you. Who's next?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lance Burbidge (Analysts)】\nGood morning it's Lance Burbidge from Autonomous. Two questions, first one for Mike. I was wondering if you might comment on what the White House has been saying on purchase of retirement products in the past couple of weeks. And secondly for Barry on Indonesia. Indonesia obviously had a very good December, is there any kind of idea you can give us in terms of how active your agency force is at that point, and sort of how much capacity you have to see that growing rapidly?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Cheick Thiam (Executives)】\nOkay. So Mike you go on with...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Wells (Executives)】\nThis is actually initiated in the Department of Labor about, I would say, 2.5 years ago at first, and I think -- and the White House is -- now has the documents. So what we're understanding is somewhere in the next 60 to 90 days, the released comment -- Office Management Budget, there will be a financial impact of the normal comment period. And then we'll see what we have. It is -- I think the academic work that was done to support the argument that something's not -- that there's not a value to the advice is always difficult because how invested would those -- what percentage of equities would those clients have had if they made the choices by themselves. And I can tell you we're dealing with advisers every month. What they will tell you is they get clients to invest when they won't and they get them to sell when they won't. And it's not -- that's a new concept. I mean, that's the same thing you'd see with advice in Asia, the U.K. or any place else. They get clients to manage risk levels prudently. I don't think the work that was published shows that. I think it shows if you bought a fund, perfectly timed ETF purchase versus bought a load fund with advice, what's the net difference, and so that's sort of, I think, the mistake in the core premise of it. But you also see the SEC pushing back on -- they see this as their enforcement jurisdiction and no, I don't think they share the mandate at this point. So I think we're going to see a lot of comment on it, a lot of discussion. I think the counter is going to be -- it's a very well-governed market, heavy disclosure, you'll probably get a little tightening of the movement from suitability, which is the U.S. standard towards best advice, which is more what you used to see, the reasons why letters and things, there isn't that concept really in the States. You see it with the SEC advisers a bit but you're probably see a more of a hybrid of the 2. And if I was guessing, that's where it will land but it will be an industry issue for 6 to 9 months at least.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Cheick Thiam (Executives)】\nAnd if I may just add 1 thing. There's a bit of good news actually in all these which is, and we met some of the White House people, they have examined commissions and decided not to touch that, and they mentioned how they are something they looked at, was not a success, and that they didn't want to imitate.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Wells (Executives)】\nThe early draft of the language as we understood it would have barred all commissions on retirement products, and again, but would have allowed advisory fees. So this -- the details of when this will matter, and I would tell you from Jackson's point of view, if it requires a change in product or structure or distribution, I think we're better situated than any of our competitors to address that quickly and effectively. And I think you're going to need systems capability, you're going to need sophisticated delivery or whatever the new structure is, technology, et cetera, and we have those capabilities.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Cheick Thiam (Executives)】\nThank you, Mike. Barry, Indonesia activity?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Barry Stowe (Executives)】\nYes. The short answer is that December was a great month, and obviously, the number of active agents spiked a bit. So that was very important. We couldn't have produced those numbers without that having happened. The dynamic that's been happening throughout the year is, last year, as we had sort of this consumer uncertainty, and then the natural disaster issue with the flooding and so forth as well, is really that we were taking longer to activate new agents. And as you know, the agency model there, a lot of the production, a material part of production is dependent upon our ability to quickly activate new agents who are being recruited. And that's really the metric where we were struggling, that it's slowed down, and that did pick up significantly in December. So I don't think we're at a point where we can declare a victory. Obviously, Tidjane alluded to the political environment there. It is -- people are more optimistic, I think, generally speaking, based on what the -- Jokowi has been able to accomplish so far. He's taken the hard decisions. As he said, he would so, I mean, that's, I think, calls for optimism. But I don't think we're in a position we could declare a victory, but we're hopeful about 2015.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Cheick Thiam (Executives)】\nWhere do we go?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nGordon?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Cheick Thiam (Executives)】\nGordon.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gordon Aitken (Analysts)】\nIt's Gordon Aitken from RBC. A couple of questions for Mike and one for Jackie. Mike, you were very open about your desire for M&A within Jackson. And you said back in December, the market was quite tough in terms of PE having lower hurdle rates. Can you update us on the market? I'm not asking about specifics about the market there. And secondly, and it's related, why do you need to acquire? I mean, if Jackson remains within the PRU Group and you have lots of diversity. Admittedly, if Jackson standalone, it leaves us exposed to VAs. And the third question for Jackie is, you had a competitor saying, in bulks they were quoting on GBP 10 billion of bulks, at this current point in time, what's your expectation for the market issue we've got? Some people are saying it's a GBP 10 billion market, that's the new norm, other people are saying GBP 100 billion over 5 years. What do you think?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Cheick Thiam (Executives)】\nOkay. Mike, do you want to start?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Wells (Executives)】\nGordon, on the M&A, I think the market remains competitive. The participants are a number of U.S. insurers and foreign insurers said they'd like to buy something you have. Private equity, that's opportunistic where I just wanted to do a single transaction and hand it to third party administrator to run, and they see it as sort of -- they tend to like the annuity deals because they see those fixed annuities as a sort of levered play on bonds. The model being stripped to capital out and run up the risk in the portfolio and just about everything the regulator doesn't want to hear. And the third is now you have private equity firms that have actually built platforms in the U.S. where they can -- they're building competitive insurance companies to consolidate, so those are the 3 types of buyers. You have the hybrids of that, [indiscernible] and things. So that's the competitive landscape. It's a great point of diversification globally. We absolutely have that as part of the group but there's actually pretty good opportunity for our shareholders when we do these purchases. We can take a lot of the expenses out of a competing life company and get materially higher returns than if we wrote a life policy individually. And it's also I think a lower risk transaction. You get away from some of the first and second-year risks when writing a life policy in the States. But the actual returns we've got on the life, the blocks we've done have been excellent for shareholders. It goes to our expense base. It goes to the technology. It goes to the service model. It's all scalable and as shareholders, you own capacity in the States and we're just utilizing some of that. So I think that's the other reason to do it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jacqueline Hunt (Executives)】\nAnd on the bulk pipeline, we continue to see it as an attractive market. Overall, we think it's about 1.8 trillion of liabilities looking for a home. If you look at the pipeline coming into this year, it has been incredibly strong, simply stronger than I've ever seen it. We will, however, continue to be selective. We've talked about being disciplined and we genuinely are disciplined. We look at the opportunities, not just in terms of the financial hurdle rates and the return in that way, but also the amount of capital consumed on various basis. So you should expect to see us active in the market but very selective about the deals that we choose to undertake.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nJust being conscious of time, we'll take a couple of more.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Oliver Steel (Analysts)】\nOliver Steel with Deutsche Bank. Three questions. The first is Elite Access, we're seeing quite a lot of a lot-like competitors, so I'm wondering what the competitive landscape is there and what advantage you still have over the competitors. Secondly, I wondered if you could just give us a bit more insight into where the SCB sort of premium increases come through. I mean, Hong Kong, fairly obviously, but perhaps you can talk to the other countries as well and where the opportunities still are. And then thirdly, Nic talked about the U.K. regulator taking a bit longer to agree to any cash transfer from the U.K. business, so I was just wondering what the issues were in that regard.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Cheick Thiam (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you, Oliver. Competition for Elite Access, Mike? A short answer.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Wells (Executives)】\nThe short answer, there's a dozen or more. I think there's 2 more filed. With our GBP 5 billion and change of sales last year, I think the most successful #2 product was in the 200s, with 70% of their sales being in their own agency force and in country. It is -- one of the things I'm most proud of with Elite Access is it is -- if you were trying to measure Jackson's capability, I think it's an excellent example of -- you need a product alignment, the design, the training. Jackson was named yesterday in one of the industry trades, BlackRock, us, and I apologize, but one other firm as providing writing the best training to advisors in the alt space period, not just the VA space. And I think the formula behind it, of building a good product, understanding the client, et cetera, and being able to help the adviser work it into the business model, that last piece is incredibly difficult. And I think that's where the competitors are having the most trouble. They're building -- well, the category is called IOVAs now, Investment Only VAs, and they're immediately adding guarantees to them. And so they're no longer IO -- so they're IOVAs with guarantees now, I guess. This is just going to continue to go to the industry's default high commission to a guarantee on it model, we're not. And it's a good investment product. And if you think of the alt returns expectations you would have, this is not a product that can support a superheavy fee load, it doesn't have the S&P kind of upside to it, so you've got to -- I think the industry's got to be careful here not to commission themselves into a product that doesn't work for the consumers.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Cheick Thiam (Executives)】\nUnless it's [indiscernible] because really Mike is being modest, but the level of success achieved by Jackson, and this is compared to the competition, is extremely impressive. I mean, GBP 5 million to GBP 200 million, it's impressive. Standard Chartered, where did the growth come from?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Wells (Executives)】\nIt's -- if you look at just what happened in the second half of the year, particularly towards the end of the year, it's actually quite broad-based. Hong Kong, which has always been the largest market, did really well. The relationship in Hong Kong in December, to give you an idea, was up 37%. You might be shocked to hear that Korea has done really well. In fact -- and I'm almost reluctant to give you this number but in December Korea was up 633% for SCB.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Cheick Thiam (Executives)】\nIt's probably from a low base.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Wells (Executives)】\nYes. It's a relatively low base. I think -- 600 policies versus the 1 we sold last year but -- and Taiwan has done well. Now Taiwan and Korea are lumpy because it's really -- there, the bank market in those 2 countries features a lot of hot money product, which we won't do. And so generally what happens is, our sales in Taiwan, and particularly in Korea, tend to spike when all of the local competitors, who manufacture the hot money products that run out of capital, and there's nowhere else to go. And then they come to us and we sell them a sensible product. So it's a little bit lumpy. But the Hong Kong story is a strong and continuing and durable story, as is the story in Singapore. We're making good traction in the markets where banca is still not as big like Malaysia is an example. One of the real shining stars post-renewal of the SCB deal, however, is really India where we did not have a relationship until we signed the new agreement, which was effective on July 1. They had -- were fully active on July 1. They got into every branch and have just done an amazing job of some specific products that are very appealing, some -- using technology. It's 100% paperless process. It's all done on iPads. It's really quite clever. And interestingly from a standing start, India went from 0 to our #4 market within the context of SCB, so a very strong start there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Cheick Thiam (Executives)】\nU.K., U.K. dividends?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicolaos Nicandrou (Executives)】\nI mean, the simple answer is that there is still too much up in the air. I mean, if I can give you some examples around that, I mean, matching adjustment is a completely new set of a new approach. You're having to think through eligibility. You have to think through cost of defaults, the cost of migration in relation to downgrades. I hope our guidance in terms of the base has only emerged in the last week and every week that goes by, you see some more guidance emerge laterally around some of the criteria around the asset liability matching and so on and so forth. All that needs to play out. We're participating in the pre-application process and are matching adjustments and we will [indiscernible] in the second quarter. Longevity. In longevity, we're moving away from a runoff test which is the way in which ICA has been underpinned. To a 1 year test then you're trying to effectively establish a capital amount that says how would you change your longevity reserves based on any information that might evolve in the year and then how do you apply 100 or 200 stress on that. So it's a completely new way of looking at things with no precedent in a 1-year context. And then luckily, lastly, the application of the risk margin is quite onerous. Again, just to give you an example, if you took, at the end of 2014 interest rates, if you took the combined effect of risk margin and SCR, that would be equivalent to around 15% of annuity reserves. That is much higher than what you're currently required to do under ICA, which brings transitionals straight into scope. They were designed exactly to do that, to give you relief, where Solvency II comes up with an answer that is different to ICA. The whole process about how you go about securing transitional relief is still up in the air. So all I was flagging is there's a lot up in the air. I mean, it will be wrong of me to sit here and say, in a year of transition with so many questions outstanding, I'd be wrong not to flag a risk that the discussions will take longer. Now the key, though, point is that the business is growing out capital. So that's key and it's the same across all of the businesses.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Cheick Thiam (Executives)】\nAnd if I can just add to it. If you step back, what I want to put on record, I said it in my notes, is that the dialogue with the regulator is good and constructive. I insist on that. We found a very receptive regulator and we're engaged in a -- Paul and I went to see them and all issues on the table, and we're all working towards a solution. That's one. Two, again, back to a capital generative comment, and stress testing the dividend. We always tell you we stress test the dividend, the group dividend. One of the scenarios we look at is what if the U.K. didn't pay any dividend for 3 years or 4 years? And I can tell you the dividend is sustainable. It can continue to grow at 5% even under those scenarios, and part of why we're always so cautious and when we -- rebates for -- we look at all those scenarios, and we give you an upward rebase that is robust and that will basically survive under any scenario, and that's really important. And the final point on the remittances is they are not actually that important because, as Nic said, if the business is cash generative, if for any reason, you stop paying from any business, you're building up very quickly a position of that business after 2 or 3 years, the capital fell [ph] through again because whatever punctual [ph] tension there is resolved. And that's why the system is very safe as a whole because if you're running 4 cash generative businesses, you can't ever really get in trouble. All you have, the timing differences. I insist on that. And that's why we feel so confident in the group dividend. It would -- just the timing difference, nothing more. Next question?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nFinal question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ashik Musaddi (Analysts)】\nJust a couple of question. First of all on your economic capital required, required capital movement, what actually drove the GBP 1 billion increase? I guess it's not the U.S. rates because you are treating U.S. on equivalence, it should not really impact the required capital. What really moved that? That's the first thing. And secondly, you showed the GBP 1.8 billion of capital generation on economic capital basis. Again, can we get more color on how much of that is coming out of U.S., because as U.S. is on the equivalence basis, how does that move? I mean, should we think about EV basis of economic capital generation? Or it's a different metric altogether?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Cheick Thiam (Executives)】\nAll right. Thanks, Ashik. Nic, [indiscernible] for you. You could obviously say no...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nicolaos Nicandrou (Executives)】\nNot on the EVs, you're absolutely right that [indiscernible] increased from 7.2 to 8.2. 1/3 of that, roughly, 1/3 is the model changes, the matching adjustment, for example, goes straight to the delta of 0.3 that I referenced, go straight to the denominator. 1/3 of that comes from literally business growth, as you put more business on to your book then it requires you to put some capital. And the other 1/3 comes roughly from FX. A lot of the required capital sits outside the U.K., and therefore, when the currency moves, that has an impact. Yes, there is some market effects but that's relatively de minimis. The GBP 1.8 billion, I mean, we bring in the U.S. from effectively the local RBC, above the GBP 250 million. I don't have the math in my head but we do give you a slide that shows the movements in the available capital in the U.S. at the back of the pack starting from the opening start position plus generation, albeit with market effect less dividend. And I think you can use that to broadly calculate it. So that's a good way of bringing that in, but of course, that's capital generation excess GBP 100 million, to excess GBP 250 million.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Cheick Thiam (Executives)】\nOkay, very good. Well, I think this brings this morning to a close. Since this is probably the last time I do a --  allow me to make a few closing remarks. Mike reminded me that he served under 5 CEOs at PRU, that I'm the longest-serving, so I'm quite pleased, for all the questions. So I'm quite pleased about the total questions on the way now. It's been a real privilege and honor to lead this company, it's a great company. And we have a great team, I've said that several times today. I took -- I think the day I was appointed, we closed at GBP 2.52. I don't know where we are today but it starts with the GBP 16 so I won't claim the credit for that because a lot of that -- I talk about hospital pass but I was appointed at an interesting time, so some of that is just crisis being resolved, some of that is really the merit of this team, and it's been a great ride. So I just want to thank all of you. I know that over the years, we've had many, many meetings, many discussions. So we won't have gotten where we are without your support, your interest in the company and your understanding. Just 2 more points. One, it may surprise you, but I want to, on record, acknowledge someone who's a fierce competitor of ours, that is Mark Tucker who gave me a great opportunity here. And I want to put it on record and express my gratitude to him, something I owe him. And finally, just to say that you shouldn't stop loving Pru. It's a great company and it has a phenomenal team. So thank you very much.",

      "transcript_text1": "Our 2015 Interim Results. As usual, Jonathan will take you through the group's financial performance, and I'll provide an update on our businesses and the future opportunities we see for each of them. We're also joined by our business heads seated here on the front row: Stephen Hodges from Banking, Julian Palfreyman from Winterflood and Martin Andrew from Asset Management. And they will assist you with any questions you have after the presentation as well.\r\nAs we announced in January, Julian will retire from his position as Chief Executive of Winterflood at the end of the current financial year. So this will be his last results presentation. And we also have Philip Yarrow here, who will be taking over from Julian in August.\r\nBefore I hand over to Jonathan, I'd just like to share the highlights of our performance in the first half of the year. The group as a whole continues to deliver good performance with adjusted operating profit growth of 16% to GBP 109 million. This reflects strong performance in Banking and continued progress in Asset Management, although Securities was affected by difficult trading conditions.\r\nAdjusted earnings per share improved by 19% to 58.2p. Importantly, we're delivering these positive results while maintaining our simple and transparent balance sheet and strong capital position. Both the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio and leverage ratio improved in the period to 13.6% and 9.9%, respectively. As a result of this good performance, our return on equity remains strong at 19%, and we've entered our fifth consecutive year of dividend growth with a 9% increase in the interim dividend to 18p per share. Overall, these results demonstrate the ability of our proven business model to deliver good results in a variety of market conditions.\r\nI'll now hand over to Jonathan.\n\n---\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you, Preben. I'm pleased to report that we have continued our good performance in the first half. As Preben has said, we achieved good growth in operating profit, up 16% to GBP 109 million. And adjusted earnings per share increased 19% to 58p, reflecting the reducing corporation tax rate.\r\nWe've declared an interim dividend of 18p per share. This is a 9% increase from last year, demonstrating our commitment to a progressive dividend policy.\r\nThe Banking division continued to generate strong profit growth with operating profit up 19% to GBP 106 million. Securities was affected by more difficult trading conditions, and profit reduced to GBP 10 million.\r\nAsset Management continued to make steady progress and increased profit to GBP 5 million. And finally, central group costs were broadly unchanged at GBP 13 million.\r\nLooking now at the income statement in more detail. Revenue increased 8% to GBP 330 million. This was driven by higher income in Banking and Asset Management, although Winterflood's income reduced. Expenses increased 7% to GBP 203 million. This reflects higher staff costs in the Banking division and continued investments in systems and infrastructure.\r\nOverall, the expense/income ratio improved slightly to 61%. Bad debt charges continued to reduce to GBP 19 million, supporting the strong profit growth in the period.\r\nIn January, we completed the disposal of Seydler, the German Securities business, which has been treated as a discontinued operation. This resulted in a GBP 10 million profit on disposal.\r\nTurning now to funding and the balance sheet, which, as you can see, has changed very little. We have maintained a strong funding position with GBP 7.2 billion of funding, covering 132% of the loan book. We access diverse sources of funding, giving us flexibility to optimize costs and maturity. And there is no change to our prudent maturity profile with term funding covering over 70% of the loan book.\r\nWe have a simple and transparent balance sheet, where the loan book and our treasury assets make up over 85% of total assets. And we have a strong liquidity position with over GBP 1 billion of liquid assets, substantially all on deposit with the Bank of England.\r\nIn recent years, our prudent approach to capital has allowed us to grow the loan book and at the same time, meet increasing regulatory requirements. Our capital ratios have improved further in the first half.\r\nThe common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 13.6%, and the leverage ratio increased to 9.9%. Tier 1 capital increased 6%, reflecting strong profitability, but risk-weighted assets increased only 2%, reflecting lower market risk following the disposal of Seydler. We are committed to maintaining a strong and prudent capital position, and we'll continue to manage our capital resources carefully.\r\nIn Banking, we achieved another strong performance, and returns continued to improve. Income was GBP 245 million, up 12% year-on-year, in line with loan book growth. Expenses were up 13%, reflecting higher staff and IT costs as we continue to invest in our service-led business model. As a result, the expense/income ratio was broadly stable at 49%.\r\nThe bad debt charge has reduced steadily for several years now, and this continued in the first half. Overall, this resulted in strong profit growth of 19% to GBP 106 million and return on net loan book of 4%. \r\nThe loan book was up 3.2% in the first half. Although this was slightly below the 4.5% last year, we continue to see growth opportunities across our markets.\r\nIn retail, the loan book increased 1.8%. This reflects modest growth in motor finance, where we've seen strong price competition in the first half. The premium finance business also grew slightly.\r\nCommercial increased 2.4%. The asset finance loan book continued to grow by 4% with good new business across all sectors. This more than offset the normal seasonal decline in invoice finance.\r\nProperty continued to grow strongly at just over 7%, reflecting continued good demand for residential development finance. Our lending continues to generate strong returns, reflecting strict underwriting discipline.\r\nWe've maintained a strong net interest margin at 8.8%. The bad debt ratio continued to improve, reaching a new low of 0.7%. This reflects our ongoing focus on credit quality, supported by a favorable economic and interest rate environment. This resulted in an excellent return on loan book of 4%.\r\nWinterflood's results was impacted by particularly difficult trading conditions in the first half. Operating profit reduced 23% to GBP 10 million, which includes some GBP 3 million related to the disposal of shares in our long-standing investment. \r\nRetail investor risk appetite was low throughout the period, and in addition, there were periods of sharply increased volatility. This resulted in 10 trading loss days compared to only 1 last year.\r\nOverall, average bargains increased slightly to 55,000 due to growth in high-volume international trading. However, income per bargain reduced to GBP 5. This reflects the difficult trading conditions and an increased share of low-margin international volumes. Overall, income reduced 13%, but expenses also reduced, reflecting Winterflood's largely variable cost structure. And as a result, Winterflood remained profitable while maintaining our market-leading position.\r\nAnd turning finally to Asset Management, where we continue to make steady progress. Income increased 7% to GBP 43 million, driven by good growth in investment management, which was up 15%. However, advice income was broadly stable, and overall, the revenue margin was stable at 86 basis points.\r\nExpenses increased modestly, reflecting the operating leverage in the business with a predominantly fixed cost base. As a result, profit increased to GBP 5 million. This corresponds to an improved operating margin at 12%.\r\nLooking now to AuM. New business remains strong across advice and investment management, with over GBP 700 million of gross inflows, some 7% of opening AuM. Net inflows in the core business were solid. However, due to an outflow of a large legacy mandate, overall net inflows were around GBP 120 million.\r\nWe also benefited from positive market movements of almost GBP 400 million. And overall, we achieved good growth in the first half, with AuM up 5% to GBP 10.2 billion.\r\nSo we are pleased with our progress in the first half, and now I'll hand you back to Preben. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Jonathan. We continue to execute our strategy, which remains unchanged and continues to deliver good results, as you see here today.\r\nThrough our expertise and service, we build long-lasting client relationships and leading positions in specialist markets. We do this by being there for our customers in all market conditions. We also maintain our strict lending criteria and prudent approach to funding and capital. This strategy allows us to generate strong returns throughout the economic cycle.\r\nAs the chart on the slide demonstrate, since 2011, first half profits have increased at an average of 14% per year, and ROE has increased from 13% to 19%. This, in turn, has allowed us to deliver progressive increases in the dividend, having held it flat during the financial crisis while still maintaining our strong capital position.\r\nIt's important to note that we've delivered these improvements in profitability and returns while at the same time, investing in our business, in our people and in our infrastructure. So let's look at what this means for each of our businesses.\r\nIn Banking, we're specialists in our markets, focusing on strong customer relationships and high levels of service. We offer direct lending services through our dedicated sales force of over 500 people and our network of specialist intermediaries, which includes motor dealers and insurance brokers.\r\nOur business model is built on the expertise of our people and our disciplined approach to credit underwriting. This supports our long-term track record of growth and profitability.\r\nThe last 5 years have been characterized by constrained credit supply and economic recovery, which has allowed us to grow our loan book strongly. At the same time, bad debts have reached historic lows, leading to increasingly strong returns.\r\nToday, we're seeing a steady increase in competition from both traditional and the newer banking groups, but we continue to see solid demand for our products. In this environment, our priority is to maintain our tried and tested business model and prudent underwriting, which will ensure we maintain our returns and continue to price risk appropriately through the cycle.\r\nAt the same time, we continue to see opportunities for future growth, and we'll actively seek out opportunities that fit with our model. This includes expanding our offering to include new products and services. For example, we're developing a new point-of-sale finance offering with specialist retailers, and our alternative energy team is now fully up and running and producing interesting opportunities.\r\nWe'll also continue to invest in people and technology to improve and expand our distribution capabilities. This is a chart that many of you have seen before but which we think is more relevant than ever as market dynamics continue to evolve.\r\nHere, you can see the strong track record of our lending business over the long term. Throughout this 25-year period, we've done what we always do: we stuck to our specialist markets and maintained our robust and prudent lending model.\r\nThe chart illustrates the benefit of the recent period of constrained credit supply, which has supported a 17% average loan book growth over the past 5 years. More importantly, looking longer term, over the last 10 years, we've delivered 12% average loan book growth and 20% average return on equity.\r\nAnd over an even longer period such as the last 25 years, we've been able to remain profitable and grow sustainably despite 2 recessions, a stock market bubble and an easy credit bubble in that period. As we enter a period of potentially more moderate growth, we remain confident that our model supports strong returns in all market conditions.\r\nMoving on to Securities. As a market maker, Winterflood is committed to providing continuous liquidity for our clients in all conditions. The last 6 months have been difficult, but our core strengths, the expertise of our staff and strong technology have ensured the business continues to trade profitably, and we maintained our leading position.\r\nMarket conditions have been challenging so far this year. Political uncertainty has caused lower levels of retail investor activity, while wider economic factors such as falling oil prices and exchange rate movements have caused periods of sharp volatility.\r\nAs you know, there's been a strong correlation between retail trading activity and Winterflood's performance. In recent years, first half adjusted operating profit has ranged between GBP 7 million in 2013 and GBP 28 million in 2010.\r\nIn this first half, retail investor activity remains subdued, and combined with sharp periods of volatility, particularly in October, means that underlying profitability is more in line with the levels seen in 2012 and '13. In this environment, we continue to focus on maximizing trading opportunities in all market conditions and remain well positioned to take advantage of any opportunities.\r\nFinally, on to Asset Management. We position this business to benefit from the demographic and regulatory changes which are driving increased demand for financial advice and wealth management solutions.\r\nOur strategy is clear. We focus on building long-term personal relationships with our clients, offering them a full range of high-quality financial planning advice and investment management services. This strategy is working as we continue to see good demand for our propositions as illustrated by strong underlying inflows.\r\nThe business continues to make steady progress. Putting the last 6 months into some context, over the past 3 years, total AuM has increased 18%, and the value of assets that we manage has grown 33%. Most importantly, the assets which are both advised and managed by us and, therefore, provide a greater revenue opportunity, have increased 54%, which has helped drive a steady improvement in profitability.\r\nLooking ahead, our priority remains to continue to build the business and the assets that we advise and manage. To do this, we continue to invest in training and development for our advisers as well as our internal systems and processes to maximize adviser productivity and support client service. We'll also look at opportunities to support our organic growth potential with inflow acquisitions and selective hiring of advisers or portfolio managers. Overall, we expect to see further improvements in profitability as the scale of the business increases.\r\nTo conclude, we're in a strong position, and we'll remain focused on meeting the needs of our clients, on executing our strategy and delivering ongoing shareholder value.\r\nIn Banking, we continue to see growth opportunities, and we'll maintain our disciplined approach to risk and returns. Winterflood remains sensitive to current market conditions but is well positioned. And in Asset Management, we expect steady growth in assets and increasing profitability.\r\nSo overall, we remain confident in the outlook for the current financial year. We now look forward to answering any questions that you may have. [Operator Instructions]",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nOur 2015 Interim Results. As usual, Jonathan will take you through the group's financial performance, and I'll provide an update on our businesses and the future opportunities we see for each of them. We're also joined by our business heads seated here on the front row: Stephen Hodges from Banking, Julian Palfreyman from Winterflood and Martin Andrew from Asset Management. And they will assist you with any questions you have after the presentation as well.\r\nAs we announced in January, Julian will retire from his position as Chief Executive of Winterflood at the end of the current financial year. So this will be his last results presentation. And we also have Philip Yarrow here, who will be taking over from Julian in August.\r\nBefore I hand over to Jonathan, I'd just like to share the highlights of our performance in the first half of the year. The group as a whole continues to deliver good performance with adjusted operating profit growth of 16% to GBP 109 million. This reflects strong performance in Banking and continued progress in Asset Management, although Securities was affected by difficult trading conditions.\r\nAdjusted earnings per share improved by 19% to 58.2p. Importantly, we're delivering these positive results while maintaining our simple and transparent balance sheet and strong capital position. Both the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio and leverage ratio improved in the period to 13.6% and 9.9%, respectively. As a result of this good performance, our return on equity remains strong at 19%, and we've entered our fifth consecutive year of dividend growth with a 9% increase in the interim dividend to 18p per share. Overall, these results demonstrate the ability of our proven business model to deliver good results in a variety of market conditions.\r\nI'll now hand over to Jonathan.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Jonathan Howell (Executives)】\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you, Preben. I'm pleased to report that we have continued our good performance in the first half. As Preben has said, we achieved good growth in operating profit, up 16% to GBP 109 million. And adjusted earnings per share increased 19% to 58p, reflecting the reducing corporation tax rate.\r\nWe've declared an interim dividend of 18p per share. This is a 9% increase from last year, demonstrating our commitment to a progressive dividend policy.\r\nThe Banking division continued to generate strong profit growth with operating profit up 19% to GBP 106 million. Securities was affected by more difficult trading conditions, and profit reduced to GBP 10 million.\r\nAsset Management continued to make steady progress and increased profit to GBP 5 million. And finally, central group costs were broadly unchanged at GBP 13 million.\r\nLooking now at the income statement in more detail. Revenue increased 8% to GBP 330 million. This was driven by higher income in Banking and Asset Management, although Winterflood's income reduced. Expenses increased 7% to GBP 203 million. This reflects higher staff costs in the Banking division and continued investments in systems and infrastructure.\r\nOverall, the expense/income ratio improved slightly to 61%. Bad debt charges continued to reduce to GBP 19 million, supporting the strong profit growth in the period.\r\nIn January, we completed the disposal of Seydler, the German Securities business, which has been treated as a discontinued operation. This resulted in a GBP 10 million profit on disposal.\r\nTurning now to funding and the balance sheet, which, as you can see, has changed very little. We have maintained a strong funding position with GBP 7.2 billion of funding, covering 132% of the loan book. We access diverse sources of funding, giving us flexibility to optimize costs and maturity. And there is no change to our prudent maturity profile with term funding covering over 70% of the loan book.\r\nWe have a simple and transparent balance sheet, where the loan book and our treasury assets make up over 85% of total assets. And we have a strong liquidity position with over GBP 1 billion of liquid assets, substantially all on deposit with the Bank of England.\r\nIn recent years, our prudent approach to capital has allowed us to grow the loan book and at the same time, meet increasing regulatory requirements. Our capital ratios have improved further in the first half.\r\nThe common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 13.6%, and the leverage ratio increased to 9.9%. Tier 1 capital increased 6%, reflecting strong profitability, but risk-weighted assets increased only 2%, reflecting lower market risk following the disposal of Seydler. We are committed to maintaining a strong and prudent capital position, and we'll continue to manage our capital resources carefully.\r\nIn Banking, we achieved another strong performance, and returns continued to improve. Income was GBP 245 million, up 12% year-on-year, in line with loan book growth. Expenses were up 13%, reflecting higher staff and IT costs as we continue to invest in our service-led business model. As a result, the expense/income ratio was broadly stable at 49%.\r\nThe bad debt charge has reduced steadily for several years now, and this continued in the first half. Overall, this resulted in strong profit growth of 19% to GBP 106 million and return on net loan book of 4%. \r\nThe loan book was up 3.2% in the first half. Although this was slightly below the 4.5% last year, we continue to see growth opportunities across our markets.\r\nIn retail, the loan book increased 1.8%. This reflects modest growth in motor finance, where we've seen strong price competition in the first half. The premium finance business also grew slightly.\r\nCommercial increased 2.4%. The asset finance loan book continued to grow by 4% with good new business across all sectors. This more than offset the normal seasonal decline in invoice finance.\r\nProperty continued to grow strongly at just over 7%, reflecting continued good demand for residential development finance. Our lending continues to generate strong returns, reflecting strict underwriting discipline.\r\nWe've maintained a strong net interest margin at 8.8%. The bad debt ratio continued to improve, reaching a new low of 0.7%. This reflects our ongoing focus on credit quality, supported by a favorable economic and interest rate environment. This resulted in an excellent return on loan book of 4%.\r\nWinterflood's results was impacted by particularly difficult trading conditions in the first half. Operating profit reduced 23% to GBP 10 million, which includes some GBP 3 million related to the disposal of shares in our long-standing investment. \r\nRetail investor risk appetite was low throughout the period, and in addition, there were periods of sharply increased volatility. This resulted in 10 trading loss days compared to only 1 last year.\r\nOverall, average bargains increased slightly to 55,000 due to growth in high-volume international trading. However, income per bargain reduced to GBP 5. This reflects the difficult trading conditions and an increased share of low-margin international volumes. Overall, income reduced 13%, but expenses also reduced, reflecting Winterflood's largely variable cost structure. And as a result, Winterflood remained profitable while maintaining our market-leading position.\r\nAnd turning finally to Asset Management, where we continue to make steady progress. Income increased 7% to GBP 43 million, driven by good growth in investment management, which was up 15%. However, advice income was broadly stable, and overall, the revenue margin was stable at 86 basis points.\r\nExpenses increased modestly, reflecting the operating leverage in the business with a predominantly fixed cost base. As a result, profit increased to GBP 5 million. This corresponds to an improved operating margin at 12%.\r\nLooking now to AuM. New business remains strong across advice and investment management, with over GBP 700 million of gross inflows, some 7% of opening AuM. Net inflows in the core business were solid. However, due to an outflow of a large legacy mandate, overall net inflows were around GBP 120 million.\r\nWe also benefited from positive market movements of almost GBP 400 million. And overall, we achieved good growth in the first half, with AuM up 5% to GBP 10.2 billion.\r\nSo we are pleased with our progress in the first half, and now I'll hand you back to Preben. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nThank you, Jonathan.

We now look forward to answering any questions that you may have. [Operator Instructions]",
      "transcript_text3": "Yes?\n\n---\n\nIt's Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital. The question on Asset Management and one on Winterflood as well. On Asset Management, I remember, a few years ago, you set targets for 2015. I think it was 100 basis point revenue margin and a 15% operating margin. And you're tracking below those targets at the moment. So maybe if you could just update us as to what's been different versus your expectations and whether those targets remain valid. And then on Winterflood, if you could just give us an update on how trading has performed since period end.\n\n---\n\nOkay. The Winterflood question, I think since period end is really a question of February and early March, and things are a bit better, actually. There's a little bit more retail demand. There's a bit more interest in the AIM markets. So things are a bit better. But we look at this as a daily trading business. That's what it is. And so as conditions improve, as I said, we'll make the most of those conditions. In terms of Asset Management, we set those targets back in 2012, and we wanted to give you a sense that we were restructuring the business, and that, that business would reach a sensible level of profitability within a sensible time frame. Those targets were only a point in time. Our ambitions for the business are beyond that 15% pretax operating margin that we set for 2015, and it is only a point in time, and that's important to remember and not to become too focused on it. Having said that, we will be kind of there or thereabouts in terms of the 15% pretax operating profit margin. We were at 12% in this half versus 8% in the same period of last year. We tend to have a stronger second half than first half, and so you'll see additional progress in that. We also indicated the revenue margin target, but I think we've pointed out to you back in September that we were tracking a little below that, and the point there is that that's all a function of mix. The more that we can advise and manage, which is substantially above 100 basis points, the more that, that margin will improve. These things never go up in a straight line. We have 3 major channels in terms of AuM. This was a period where the investment management channel managed the assets, went up more quickly than the advised and managed channels. So we will continue to see an improvement in that revenue margin. We're happy with the progress that we're making, but it won't be in a straight line. I think that -- and it'll all take some time. So that's what I would say.\n\n---\n\nIs the 100 basis points still a valid target, though?\n\n---\n\nI think we're not hooked on it. We will continue to improve as the mix changes. It was only ever meant to be an indication of the direction and is only ever meant to be a point in time. So I think we'll make progress towards it. And as I say, advised and managed business is well above 100 basis points. Purely managed business is more in the kind of 70s. So it really just depends on the pace of the change in that mix. We'll continue to pursue all of our major channels rather than trying to direct ourselves in order to reach that target kind of artificially. I think that's not in the interest of the business.\n\n---\n\nIt's Gurjit Kambo from JPMorgan. Just in terms of the sort of competitive landscape in the Banking area, either from existing competitors or new competitors, if you could just provide any sort of update there would be helpful.\n\n---\n\nSure. Let me make 2 comments, and then I might invite Stephen to add anything that he might -- we are seeing more credit supply, no question, and that supply is coming both from the larger banks that are providing more unsecured credit generally and also from 1 or 2 of the new Banking groups. In terms of where we see that, I think we see it evidently in the motor business from the larger banks, and they are clearly making more credit available there. They are keen on price. And that, as we, I think, have described to you in the past, comes in with the big dealers and then kind of filters its way down to the midsized motor dealers. We, if you like, start at the small dealers and work our way up through the midsized dealers. And our market share tends to move with the amount of credit that the large banks are supplying there. At the height of the crisis, if you like, our market share went up to around 11%, 12%. It's back down in the 7s now. We tend to protect our margins and our returns in the business rather than chasing share or chasing growth. But that's an example of where we are seeing more competition from the larger banking groups, in particular, in motor. I think the other one that I'd point to is in asset finance, where there's a lot of focus on the emerging challenger banks, and that is where we would see them. It's important to note that we have a different business model. So we go direct as well as through brokers. We have 200 people on the ground in asset finance as well as going through the brokers. So that's an important difference. And then it's also important to note that we don't overlap with them very much. So they have big mortgage businesses and residential and commercial, we don't do that. So we're really focused. The overlap is in asset finance and invoice finance. But it's a big market. Our share of the asset finance market is about 7%. It's risen during the last 5 years. There's plenty of opportunity. We're seeing good demand. We're seeing a pickup in demand, if anything, in a few of our sectors. So the backdrop is important. Stephen, do you want to add anything?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think you've covered the main points. I mean, in each of our businesses, we have a different competitive landscape. In some, as Preben has referred to, clearly in motor, it's a more vanilla business. It's the area you would expect to see more competitors coming into earlier in the cycle. But our branch network, our service and our specialization protect us, and we're very clear that we're going to stick to that model regardless of the competitive pressure. In other areas, our particular approach gives us greater protection. I think in asset and in property, in particular, we're focused as much on what's happening on the demand side of the equation as we are on the supply, and I think there is clearly growth in the U.K. economy at the moment. That has led, I think, to an increase in investment by SMEs generally. We expect to see that waver a bit as we get towards the election because political uncertainty will make people postpone their investment plans. But underneath it all, the outlook for the U.K. economy is good for the foreseeable future, and we do expect that to be reflected in increased investment from our customers.\n\n---\n\nYes?\n\n---\n\nIt's Robin Savage from Canaccord. So further to that question, I wonder whether, Stephen, you could -- and Preben, you could explain the areas, which you really won't go into in terms of lending and perhaps talk about your attitude towards point-of-sale finance. You seem to be talking about -- how does that fit with the idea that it's actually secured lending if you're lending now on sort of point of sale or on retail purchases?\n\n---\n\nI mean, I think just the first answer, where will we not go, we're not in the mortgage market, either residentially or commercially. So that's a very large part of other banks' business, but it's not part of our business. That's the most obvious. In point of sale, I think the point -- we're already in the point-of-sale market.\n\n---\n\nSubstantially.\n\n---\n\nYes, very substantially. Our entire motor business is a point-of-sale business.\n\n---\n\nAs is our premium.\n\n---\n\nAs is our premium business. So 2 of our large businesses are already point-of-sale businesses that we originate through motor dealers or insurance brokers. So we are a point-of-sale lender. In fact, in terms of our retail lending business, it's entirely point of sale. The reference I made to where else we might apply that point-of-sale lending is that we're just in the early stages of exploring, providing point-of-sale financing to specialist retailers. And there, I think the important thing would be that it's a specialist market. It shares a lot of the attributes with our other businesses. It's kind of niche like. It's specialist. It's something that they're not getting from the large banks or not getting with the kinds of service proposition that they would like. It allows them to do things that they otherwise couldn't do in terms of providing sales campaigns and things like that, and it's potentially interesting to us, but it's in the very early stages.\n\n---\n\nIt's James Hamilton from Numis. Given that your return on the net loan book is so strong by historical standards and, obviously, return on equity is also exceptionally good by historical standards, why aren't you growing more rapidly in the bank? And on that point, could you comment on the sort of the flow ROE that you expect? I mean, I can understand your slowdown in the balance sheet growth if the flow ROEs were not high enough, but even by your standards, I must -- I would explore to the marketplace at the moment. If you cut your pricing, you could swamp the balance sheet with assets generating returns on equity maybe 24% rather than 28%, and we'd all be very happy.\n\n---\n\nSo it's an understandable question. We think it's incredibly important that we stick to our model. And it served us so well for 25 or 30 years, and that model doesn't target growth. The model is applied to the circumstances of the market, and growth is an output. So our model is all about high service, flexibility, speed and those quite important things for which we charge an appropriate price. Trying to reduce those price points in order to drive volume periodically would start us down a path that would make us look too much like everybody else. It would accentuate the cyclicality of the business. Banks are very good at creating their own credit cycles by reducing their return and reducing their loan standards in order to chase growth. We've never done that, and we never will, and it's served us pretty well.\n\n---\n\nI would just add a couple of points to that. The first is that one of the contributing factors to the high return on the net loan book that you referred to is a very, very low charge currently for bad debt. Now that's partly down to our credit underwriting, but it's also partly down to the fact that the market as a whole is seeing low levels of defaults at the moment. That's not particular to us. Now we don't believe that's a permanent state of affairs. So for us and for the market as a whole, at some point, the bad debt will get back into its normal range, and that's really where we are pricing our product to cater for that if and when that happens. On the growth point, I think the point to make is that our year-on-year growth, our rolling 12-month growth rate in the loan book is 12.5%. So yes, we have some good quarters and some bad quarters, but the underlying rate of growth is still acceptable.\n\n---\n\nIf I could just add on top of what Stephen said. In terms of the position on bad debt, Stephen's absolutely right. As we go through the cycle, we would expect the bad debt charge to go back into the middle of the range and then ultimately in full recession to the top of the range. I just want to stress, though, that in the short term, over the next 3 to 6 months, we are not in this announcement calling any sort of uptick in bad debts or downtick. As far as we can see at the moment, we can't see a trend in either direction. I know over the last 12 to 18 months, we've consistently said we can't take any better, and it has got better. This time, we're calling the end of that sort of in terms of that guidance.\n\n---\n\nIf I could just follow up, I mean, the duration of your book is short, and obviously, impairment charges very cyclical and clearly after recession you've washed away most of the junk and it was survivorship bias. You're guiding that over the average duration of book, you don't think that adjusting the price to take account of the loan, impairment charge is appropriate and that the sort of normalized returns aren't available over the duration of your book.\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, I think over the duration of the book, we -- that will move according to the cycle. What we're saying is that over the short term, for the short-duration book, we're not anticipating a too material change in that bad debt charge either up nor down.\n\n---\n\nPhilip over there.\n\n---\n\nJust very quickly, on the -- on Winterflood, I quite understand why you had more loss days than normal. Could you give us some idea of how much of an impact that was on the profitability? And did that just offset the Euronext sale? Or was that much more than that? Or how do we think about that?\n\n---\n\nWe don't break that out, but to give you a sense of it, it's not -- I mean, it's roughly of that magnitude, yes. If you look at kind of what we benefited from in terms of our sale and the cumulative impact of the loss days, it's not very far away.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I look forward to bad debt ratio coming even lower next time.\n\n---\n\nIt is -- I mean -- just to add my 2 penny worth on that, conditions are very benign right now, and we don't expect those very benign conditions to change based on anything that we can see going out. And we can see months out, but we can't see very much farther out than that. So we really don't want you to kind of go away and think that the bad debt number is going to change anytime soon. It's just that we are very cognizant of the 10-year average of bad debt being 1.5%. And the range we always quoted until about a year ago was between 1% and 2.6%, and we find ourselves at 0.7%. So those are the facts, and we all know that these conditions are exceptional.\n\n---\n\nA couple of quick follow-ups. First, on Winterflood. I heard you were saying that it was a cyclical issue rather than a structural issue. I'm just wondering on the income per bargain, that dropped down. Is that entirely attributable to a mix shift away from AIM, i.e. is the income per bargain in AIM and in large-cap stocks the same as it has been?\n\n---\n\nI mean, I would say that very broadly, what you should look at there is that this is a poor period for AIM and a period which included 10 loss days. So obviously, if you just look at income per bargain, income is affected by both of those things. And at the same time, we signaled that we are doing more volume in international stocks, and that's at the larger-cap, smaller-margin end. So those are the things that all kind of contributed to that change in income per bargain. We're not saying that this period of 6 months is signaling any kind of structural change in our ability to make money in the AIM market or in the margins that are available in large-cap stocks. I mean, AIM is a high-margin business, and large-cap stocks is a low-margin business. That continues to be broadly true.\n\n---\n\nAnd the second one, you mentioned alternative energy is an opportunity for the bank. I'm wondering if you could maybe characterize that opportunity in a bit more numbers and potential market share in terms of the markets.\n\n---\n\nIt's -- we don't break down the sort of subdivisions for that level. This is a team of people that we told you we hired from the co-op that had a good alternative energy team. They've now been here for a while, and they're up and running. And so the deal flow is starting to become interesting, but it will always be a relatively small business in the context of the whole bank rather than becoming a large business in the context of the whole bank. It's more that it's an example of another specialist niche that we could acquire, which sits appropriately alongside the other things that we do.\n\n---\n\nBut it's a business where we would expect to see long-term sustainable growth?\n\n---\n\nYes. Any other questions?\n\n---\n\nIt's Robin Savage again. Just on the -- the board looks to the dividend at the end of the year, I just wonder whether you can list the various factors which would be taken into account.\n\n---\n\nThis is Jonathan's specialist subject. So I'll let him answer this.\n\n---\n\nWell, first of all, as you can see, Robin, 9% increase in the first half, and that follows on from 10% from last year's full dividend. And as we've been saying that for 5 years, as we've grown the dividend and grown the cover at the same time, those are the 2 considerations that the board will have. And what we've been in the fortunate position over the last 5 years of increases to be able to move the dividend forward was improving the cover. And to give you a guide around the sort of endpoint to what we consider to be appropriate cover for a well-capitalized and well-run bank through the cycle, that's in a range of 2 to 2.5. And I can just point you to one data point, which was at the end of last financial year, we were on a dividend cover of 2.1.\n\n---\n\nAny other questions. Yes?\n\n---\n\nSo I just have one follow-up. It's Gurjit here from JPMorgan. Just in terms of sort of infill acquisitions in Asset Management business, where do you see sort of opportunities from the changes on the regulatory side and IDR? Or is it potentially from pension fund changes which are going on? And how you want to position yourself for that?\n\n---\n\nI think in terms of infill acquisitions, I mean, we would be looking for things that add to our model. And our model, as you know, is providing advice and investment management services. So we've hired portfolio managers that go directly into the investment management side of the business, and we've made small IFA acquisitions, which go directly into the advice side of the business. We've done both of those things, and we would continue to look on both sides of that business, actually. That is a function of all of the change that's going on and the fact that ISA is an integrated model, which includes both of those.\r\nAny other questions? Thank you very much. Thank you for coming.",
      "transcript_text4": "【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nYes?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gary Greenwood (Analysts)】\nIt's Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital. The question on Asset Management and one on Winterflood as well. On Asset Management, I remember, a few years ago, you set targets for 2015. I think it was 100 basis point revenue margin and a 15% operating margin. And you're tracking below those targets at the moment. So maybe if you could just update us as to what's been different versus your expectations and whether those targets remain valid. And then on Winterflood, if you could just give us an update on how trading has performed since period end.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nOkay. The Winterflood question, I think since period end is really a question of February and early March, and things are a bit better, actually. There's a little bit more retail demand. There's a bit more interest in the AIM markets. So things are a bit better. But we look at this as a daily trading business. That's what it is. And so as conditions improve, as I said, we'll make the most of those conditions. In terms of Asset Management, we set those targets back in 2012, and we wanted to give you a sense that we were restructuring the business, and that, that business would reach a sensible level of profitability within a sensible time frame. Those targets were only a point in time. Our ambitions for the business are beyond that 15% pretax operating margin that we set for 2015, and it is only a point in time, and that's important to remember and not to become too focused on it. Having said that, we will be kind of there or thereabouts in terms of the 15% pretax operating profit margin. We were at 12% in this half versus 8% in the same period of last year. We tend to have a stronger second half than first half, and so you'll see additional progress in that. We also indicated the revenue margin target, but I think we've pointed out to you back in September that we were tracking a little below that, and the point there is that that's all a function of mix. The more that we can advise and manage, which is substantially above 100 basis points, the more that, that margin will improve. These things never go up in a straight line. We have 3 major channels in terms of AuM. This was a period where the investment management channel managed the assets, went up more quickly than the advised and managed channels. So we will continue to see an improvement in that revenue margin. We're happy with the progress that we're making, but it won't be in a straight line. I think that -- and it'll all take some time. So that's what I would say.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gary Greenwood (Analysts)】\nIs the 100 basis points still a valid target, though?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nI think we're not hooked on it. We will continue to improve as the mix changes. It was only ever meant to be an indication of the direction and is only ever meant to be a point in time. So I think we'll make progress towards it. And as I say, advised and managed business is well above 100 basis points. Purely managed business is more in the kind of 70s. So it really just depends on the pace of the change in that mix. We'll continue to pursue all of our major channels rather than trying to direct ourselves in order to reach that target kind of artificially. I think that's not in the interest of the business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gurjit Kambo (Analysts)】\nIt's Gurjit Kambo from JPMorgan. Just in terms of the sort of competitive landscape in the Banking area, either from existing competitors or new competitors, if you could just provide any sort of update there would be helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nSure. Let me make 2 comments, and then I might invite Stephen to add anything that he might -- we are seeing more credit supply, no question, and that supply is coming both from the larger banks that are providing more unsecured credit generally and also from 1 or 2 of the new Banking groups. In terms of where we see that, I think we see it evidently in the motor business from the larger banks, and they are clearly making more credit available there. They are keen on price. And that, as we, I think, have described to you in the past, comes in with the big dealers and then kind of filters its way down to the midsized motor dealers. We, if you like, start at the small dealers and work our way up through the midsized dealers. And our market share tends to move with the amount of credit that the large banks are supplying there. At the height of the crisis, if you like, our market share went up to around 11%, 12%. It's back down in the 7s now. We tend to protect our margins and our returns in the business rather than chasing share or chasing growth. But that's an example of where we are seeing more competition from the larger banking groups, in particular, in motor. I think the other one that I'd point to is in asset finance, where there's a lot of focus on the emerging challenger banks, and that is where we would see them. It's important to note that we have a different business model. So we go direct as well as through brokers. We have 200 people on the ground in asset finance as well as going through the brokers. So that's an important difference. And then it's also important to note that we don't overlap with them very much. So they have big mortgage businesses and residential and commercial, we don't do that. So we're really focused. The overlap is in asset finance and invoice finance. But it's a big market. Our share of the asset finance market is about 7%. It's risen during the last 5 years. There's plenty of opportunity. We're seeing good demand. We're seeing a pickup in demand, if anything, in a few of our sectors. So the backdrop is important. Stephen, do you want to add anything?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Hodges (Executives)】\nYes, I think you've covered the main points. I mean, in each of our businesses, we have a different competitive landscape. In some, as Preben has referred to, clearly in motor, it's a more vanilla business. It's the area you would expect to see more competitors coming into earlier in the cycle. But our branch network, our service and our specialization protect us, and we're very clear that we're going to stick to that model regardless of the competitive pressure. In other areas, our particular approach gives us greater protection. I think in asset and in property, in particular, we're focused as much on what's happening on the demand side of the equation as we are on the supply, and I think there is clearly growth in the U.K. economy at the moment. That has led, I think, to an increase in investment by SMEs generally. We expect to see that waver a bit as we get towards the election because political uncertainty will make people postpone their investment plans. But underneath it all, the outlook for the U.K. economy is good for the foreseeable future, and we do expect that to be reflected in increased investment from our customers.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nYes?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robin Savage (Analysts)】\nIt's Robin Savage from Canaccord. So further to that question, I wonder whether, Stephen, you could -- and Preben, you could explain the areas, which you really won't go into in terms of lending and perhaps talk about your attitude towards point-of-sale finance. You seem to be talking about -- how does that fit with the idea that it's actually secured lending if you're lending now on sort of point of sale or on retail purchases?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nI mean, I think just the first answer, where will we not go, we're not in the mortgage market, either residentially or commercially. So that's a very large part of other banks' business, but it's not part of our business. That's the most obvious. In point of sale, I think the point -- we're already in the point-of-sale market.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Hodges (Executives)】\nSubstantially.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nYes, very substantially. Our entire motor business is a point-of-sale business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Hodges (Executives)】\nAs is our premium.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nAs is our premium business. So 2 of our large businesses are already point-of-sale businesses that we originate through motor dealers or insurance brokers. So we are a point-of-sale lender. In fact, in terms of our retail lending business, it's entirely point of sale. The reference I made to where else we might apply that point-of-sale lending is that we're just in the early stages of exploring, providing point-of-sale financing to specialist retailers. And there, I think the important thing would be that it's a specialist market. It shares a lot of the attributes with our other businesses. It's kind of niche like. It's specialist. It's something that they're not getting from the large banks or not getting with the kinds of service proposition that they would like. It allows them to do things that they otherwise couldn't do in terms of providing sales campaigns and things like that, and it's potentially interesting to us, but it's in the very early stages.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Hamilton (Analysts)】\nIt's James Hamilton from Numis. Given that your return on the net loan book is so strong by historical standards and, obviously, return on equity is also exceptionally good by historical standards, why aren't you growing more rapidly in the bank? And on that point, could you comment on the sort of the flow ROE that you expect? I mean, I can understand your slowdown in the balance sheet growth if the flow ROEs were not high enough, but even by your standards, I must -- I would explore to the marketplace at the moment. If you cut your pricing, you could swamp the balance sheet with assets generating returns on equity maybe 24% rather than 28%, and we'd all be very happy.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nSo it's an understandable question. We think it's incredibly important that we stick to our model. And it served us so well for 25 or 30 years, and that model doesn't target growth. The model is applied to the circumstances of the market, and growth is an output. So our model is all about high service, flexibility, speed and those quite important things for which we charge an appropriate price. Trying to reduce those price points in order to drive volume periodically would start us down a path that would make us look too much like everybody else. It would accentuate the cyclicality of the business. Banks are very good at creating their own credit cycles by reducing their return and reducing their loan standards in order to chase growth. We've never done that, and we never will, and it's served us pretty well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Stephen Hodges (Executives)】\nI would just add a couple of points to that. The first is that one of the contributing factors to the high return on the net loan book that you referred to is a very, very low charge currently for bad debt. Now that's partly down to our credit underwriting, but it's also partly down to the fact that the market as a whole is seeing low levels of defaults at the moment. That's not particular to us. Now we don't believe that's a permanent state of affairs. So for us and for the market as a whole, at some point, the bad debt will get back into its normal range, and that's really where we are pricing our product to cater for that if and when that happens. On the growth point, I think the point to make is that our year-on-year growth, our rolling 12-month growth rate in the loan book is 12.5%. So yes, we have some good quarters and some bad quarters, but the underlying rate of growth is still acceptable.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jonathan Howell (Executives)】\nIf I could just add on top of what Stephen said. In terms of the position on bad debt, Stephen's absolutely right. As we go through the cycle, we would expect the bad debt charge to go back into the middle of the range and then ultimately in full recession to the top of the range. I just want to stress, though, that in the short term, over the next 3 to 6 months, we are not in this announcement calling any sort of uptick in bad debts or downtick. As far as we can see at the moment, we can't see a trend in either direction. I know over the last 12 to 18 months, we've consistently said we can't take any better, and it has got better.

What we're saying is that over the short term, for the short-duration book, we're not anticipating a too material change in that bad debt charge either up nor down.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nPhilip over there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Philip Middleton (Analysts)】\nJust very quickly, on the -- on Winterflood, I quite understand why you had more loss days than normal. Could you give us some idea of how much of an impact that was on the profitability? And did that just offset the Euronext sale? Or was that much more than that? Or how do we think about that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nWe don't break that out, but to give you a sense of it, it's not -- I mean, it's roughly of that magnitude, yes. If you look at kind of what we benefited from in terms of our sale and the cumulative impact of the loss days, it's not very far away.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Philip Middleton (Analysts)】\nOkay. I look forward to bad debt ratio coming even lower next time.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nIt is -- I mean -- just to add my 2 penny worth on that, conditions are very benign right now, and we don't expect those very benign conditions to change based on anything that we can see going out. And we can see months out, but we can't see very much farther out than that. So we really don't want you to kind of go away and think that the bad debt number is going to change anytime soon. It's just that we are very cognizant of the 10-year average of bad debt being 1.5%. And the range we always quoted until about a year ago was between 1% and 2.6%, and we find ourselves at 0.7%. So those are the facts, and we all know that these conditions are exceptional.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nA couple of quick follow-ups. First, on Winterflood. I heard you were saying that it was a cyclical issue rather than a structural issue. I'm just wondering on the income per bargain, that dropped down. Is that entirely attributable to a mix shift away from AIM, i.e. is the income per bargain in AIM and in large-cap stocks the same as it has been?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nI mean, I would say that very broadly, what you should look at there is that this is a poor period for AIM and a period which included 10 loss days. So obviously, if you just look at income per bargain, income is affected by both of those things. And at the same time, we signaled that we are doing more volume in international stocks, and that's at the larger-cap, smaller-margin end. So those are the things that all kind of contributed to that change in income per bargain. We're not saying that this period of 6 months is signaling any kind of structural change in our ability to make money in the AIM market or in the margins that are available in large-cap stocks. I mean, AIM is a high-margin business, and large-cap stocks is a low-margin business. That continues to be broadly true.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nAnd the second one, you mentioned alternative energy is an opportunity for the bank. I'm wondering if you could maybe characterize that opportunity in a bit more numbers and potential market share in terms of the markets.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nIt's -- we don't break down the sort of subdivisions for that level. This is a team of people that we told you we hired from the co-op that had a good alternative energy team. They've now been here for a while, and they're up and running. And so the deal flow is starting to become interesting, but it will always be a relatively small business in the context of the whole bank rather than becoming a large business in the context of the whole bank. It's more that it's an example of another specialist niche that we could acquire, which sits appropriately alongside the other things that we do.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nBut it's a business where we would expect to see long-term sustainable growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nYes. Any other questions?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robin Savage (Analysts)】\nIt's Robin Savage again. Just on the -- the board looks to the dividend at the end of the year, I just wonder whether you can list the various factors which would be taken into account.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Preben Prebensen (Executives)】\nThis is Jonathan's specialist subject.

Yes?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gurjit Kambo (Analysts)】\nSo I just have one follow-up. It's Gurjit here from JPMorgan.

We would like to remind everyone that this webcast presentation will be available on our website at http://corpo.couche-tard.com for a period of 90 days.\r\nAlso, please remember that some of these issues being discussed during this webcast might include forward-looking statements, which are provided by the corporation with its usual caveats. These caveats or risks and uncertainties are outlined in our financial reporting. Therefore, our future results could differ from the information discussed today.\r\nI will now turn this presentation over to Mr. Brian Hannasch, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Raymond Paré, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Gentlemen, please go ahead.\n\n---\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for listening in on this webcast regarding Couche-Tard's third quarter of our fiscal 2015. Here with me is Raymond Paré, our Vice President and CFO. As usual, we'll briefly run through the results and offer some background information before answering the questions you submitted earlier today. The last months were marked by significant development in terms of our network growth. The acquisition of The Pantry and it's over 1,500 stores, valued at about $1.7 billion did close yesterday. And the one [ph] that we announced this morning in Denmark with Shell is also very significant for us. They're both highly complementary to our existing networks and will strengthen our competitive positions in these markets. These acquisitions, along with the remaining synergies of our European business, the food progress in North America and continued solid organic growth continue to add value for the company. You know us. We're not wasting any time. As we speak, I can confirm that our teams are already actively not planning, but implementing our integration plans and realizing synergies for The Pantry. We believe we'll be able to realize annual cost reductions [ph] or expense reductions of about $85 million over the next 24 months, in addition to growing gross profit through increased sales and reduced cost of goods. We'll keep you posted on our progress as we progress through the fiscal year.\r\nIn Europe, we just announced this morning an agreement with Shell Oil to acquire its retail, commercial fuel and aviation businesses in Denmark, which will be a great complement to our existing network in that country. The closing of this transaction is conditional to the competition authority approval, and will be an important exciting step for Couche-Tard going forward. If you remember, one of the strategic reasons for the acquisition of Statoil Fuel & Retail more than 2 years ago was to allow us to build the foundation for further expansion into Europe. This is the first step in what we hope will be many more, and we hope to close this transaction by the end of our fiscal 2016.\r\nBack in the U.S., let's not forget the agreement we signed yesterday also for the acquisition of 21 company-operated stores and 151 dealer supply contracts in the states of Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana. These company-operated stores are very good, high-volume sites and will be a great fit to our existing Southwest network.\r\nLast but not least, our development teams are working full steam ahead, which allow us to meet our objective in terms of network growth this year. Since beginning of the year, we've already added more than 65 sites through acquisition of single-company stores, new construction, reconstruction or relocation of existing sites.\r\nNow before I let Raymond discuss the financial details, a few words on our third quarter financial performance. I believe we once again achieved great performance on all fronts, which resulted in an increase of 65.1% in adjusted net earnings year-over-year. And I can assure you that this performance is not only just about high fuel margins. In Europe, while the market remains difficult, the trends continue to be positive. Same-store sales and volumes both continued their growth and remained  [ph] a high pace in terms of cost reductions, getting closer to our target of $200 million in synergies. Our miles fuel brand continued to gain traction and perform well against the market, while we completed the rollout of our loyalty program in Poland and the Baltics this last quarter, which will also give us a good return and another tool in the toolbox to increase sales.\r\nFinally, our food service continues to perform well, and we've had some exciting innovations in the pipeline. In North America, we continue to post solid results with improved sales and steady merchandise and service margins. On the fuel side, I'm particularly pleased with our performance on the fuel volume in the U.S., where we believe we're outperforming the market. This performance in North America is even more impressive, taking into consideration their teams that managed to once again grow the business quarter and another quarter, while keeping our costs under control. And in previous quarters, the reimbursement of our debt contributed to our improved leverage ratio, while return on capital deployed maintained a steady progression upward.\r\nAnd now I'll let Raymond go over the results in a little more detail. Ray?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone. The third quarter is once again a great continuity to our year and the previous years. We are proud to show growth in our results and key indicators. We have posted net earnings of $248.1 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Some items affected the results of this quarter, and they are described in our MD&A. Once adjusted for these items, adjusted net earnings stood at $289 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2015, an increase of 65.1%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share stood at approximately $0.51 compared to $0.31 for the corresponding quarters of 2014, an increase of 64.5%. The growth in adjusted net earnings is derived from our strong organic growth in both merchandise and service and road transportation fuel, higher fuel margin in North America, the contribution of our recent acquisition and the decrease in financial expense following our repayment of a significant portion of our debt. These items, which contribute to growth in net earnings, were partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollars against the other major functional currencies of our Canadian and European divisions and a higher tax rate. These great results show our ability to maintain good performance and improve our financial position quarter after quarter. Instead of repeating the MD&A, which is available on SEDAR, I will quickly highlight some of the key indicators for the quarters and give some additional colors on certain subjects, when appropriate.\r\nOur same-store merchandise sales increased by 4.5% in the United States, by 1.7% in Europe and by 3.6% in Canada. Our performance in North America is attributable to our dynamic merchandising strategies, our competitive offer as well as our expanded fresh food offered, which increased the traffic in our stores. In Europe, the exchange of best practices, new merchandising strategies and marketing campaigns helped us to reach these results -- a story that you already know, and that we are focusing to maintain. The consolidated merchandise and service gross margin grew by 36 points, $5 million, when excluding the negative impact from the currency translation. The gross margin was 32.8% in Canada (sic) [ U.S. ], 41% in Europe and 32.2% in Canada, for a consolidated margin of 33.7%. In the United States, the gross margin was positively impacted by the continuous growth in fresh food sales as well as by less promotional activity this year compared to last year. In Europe, the mix and the merchandising strategy has an impact, but the margin continued to be solid.\r\nAs for fuel, same-store volume increased by 2.8% in the United States, and by 2.1% in Europe, while it decreased by 0.5% in Canada. The first 2 markets are the most significant in term of volume and contribution for fuel. During the third quarter of the fiscal 2015, we posted road transportation fuel gross margin of $0.2493 per gallon in the U.S., $0.0981 per liter in Europe and CAD 0.0612 per liter in Canada. The drop in our fuel margin in Europe is almost entirely explained by the foreign exchange translation. In fact, it's pretty stable. I know that many analysts were more bullish on the fuel gross margin in the U.S. Without knowing all the details of their analysis, potentially, the difference comes from the impact of some markets that has lower margin than others. We still believe that our supply condition and our pricing strategy gave us a strategic advantage versus the majority of the market, and this situation did not change during the quarter. As usual, we continue to manage our expenses carefully. Although our organic growth was significant, the increase in our operational expenses was lower than the inflation, mainly because of the benefits from the continuous optimization of our processes as well as cost reduction in Europe. As always, we intend to continue to favor a tight control of our costs throughout the organization, whilst making sure to maintain the quality of service we offer our client.\r\nThe third quarter of the fiscal 2015 shows an income tax rate of 29.3% compared to the -- an income tax rate of 23.4% for the second quarter of the current year. The increase is mainly attributable to the higher proportion of our results coming from the United States, where the tax rates are higher and to an internal corporate reorganization that was positive over the year in terms of cash flow, but has a temporary impact on the income tax rate for the quarters and the year. The annual rate should be in line with the year-to-date rate, around 25%. Excluding the settlement, it would have been around 21%. The impact of this reorganization is temporary and should not have a negative impact on the next fiscal year.\r\nUsing the strong free cash flow from our operation and proceeds from the disposal of the aviation fuel business, we were once again able to repay a total amount of $320 million on our revolving facility. Those reimbursement contribute to, once again, improve our leverage ratio. As of February 1, 2015, our adjusted net interest-bearing debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio was 1.71. This gave us great flexibility to take advantage of investment opportunities and maintain a solid credit profile. The Pantry acquisition was financed using our cash on hand, our actual credit facility that we increased by $1 billion at the same conditions. Our leverage after the transaction will be way under the 3, maintaining our -- around, I will say -- let's say around 2.5, maintaining our strong credit profile. Again, this quarter, our return on capital employed also improved, reaching 17.8%, while our return on equity remained solid at 24.6%. Like everyone in the organization, I'm very excited about the new opportunity offered to us by the acquisition of The Pantry. I'm impressed by the level of commitment from our peoples to make this project a success, as usual, which makes me quite confident that we'll be able to continue to create significant value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. We will also maintain our focus on our European operations, create continuous improvement and value. Our team in Europe is doing a great job related to that. As Brian mentioned, our opportunity to create value for the years to come is significant organically. We also continue to have acquisition opportunity. We will approach these with the same financial discipline, as usual. And that conclude my part. Brian?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Raymond. As was stated in the introduction, I'm pleased with the results of the third quarter and the acquisitions we just closed. But we all realize there's still a fair amount of work to be done. In the next month, we'll be busy. I'm certain even more rewarding. We've a very solid integration plan for The Pantry, and we'll be working on one for Denmark. We have a strong track record of combining the strength of companies we acquired with our own. I'm confident these acquisitions will even -- make us an even stronger competitor than we are today and deliver strong results for us. Everyone at Couche-Tard remains fully dedicated to continuing the path of excellence, and we expect to deliver significant value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nWe will now answer questions you submitted earlier today.",

Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nWe will now answer questions you submitted earlier today.",
      "transcript_text3": "First question is from Patricia Baker, Scotia Capital. Can you share with us any operational metrics on Shell Denmark? How does the performance of those sites compare with the SFR business? And in what manner will we see the operation integrated into the European operation as a whole?\n\n---\n\nI'll start with Denmark, being a core market for Couche-Tard. It's right next to Norway, Sweden. A lot of cross-border traffic, B2B business, across all those countries. So it's a great market for us to expand in. We think, with the Shell network, we have the opportunity to create an unparalleled, unmanned offer, automat offer and a full-service convenience offer that's superior to anyone else in the market. When you compare it specifically to networks, Shell has a strong network. In merchandise sales and fuel leaders are materially above the market average and only second to our own in the country. In terms of the integration, it will be fully integrated into our business with the exception of the fuel brand, which we've committed to remain Shell.\n\n---\n\nCan you discuss, in general, terms the health of the 3 markets from a consumer and an economy perspective? And how they compare?\n\n---\n\nFor us, the trends really haven't changed a lot over the last couple of quarters. The U.S. continues to strengthen, both in sales, customer count and basket and then also fuel gallons. So we're very optimistic. And although some of the press out there would say that the consumer is saving the money not spending it, we think there's clear signs of that business improving for us in the States. Canada, the West continues to be strong, but we are still struggling with softer results in Ontario and Québec. While sales are positive, there's a heavy intense competition for customers, and that's also put some pressure on merchandise margins in the eastern half of the country. In Europe, despite a difficult market, as Raymond mentioned, I think we continue to outperform the market, both driven by our food, which is posting solid growth in really all divisions, and also by fuel, up double -- it's not double-digit, up 2.1% in what I would argue was probably a flat to slightly declining market. So in that context, we really feel good about the results in Europe as well.\n\n---\n\nNext questions are from Derek Dley from Canaccord Genuity. Your tax rate was higher than recent quarters, even after adjusting the $16 million internal reorganization expense. What should we expect as a range for the tax rate going forward, now that you have added additional debt with The Pantry acquisition?\n\n---\n\nThe tax rate in Q2 was influenced by this reorganization more materially. It was in fact a true-up, basically, for the entire year. On an annual basis, the tax rate would've been basically around 21% without this element versus a 25% that again we should achieve. And don't quote me on that because again if our taxable income in the U.S. is way higher than last year, this tax rate will have the tendency to go up. But everyone will be happy with that, I'm pretty sure. Next years, the tax rate will be influenced positively, clearly by The Pantry acquisition. Then -- but we again, we're in the budget process, and we need to continue to do our calculation to establish exactly what will be our tax rate for next year.\n\n---\n\nThe next question. Can you provide some color on your synergy expectations for The Pantry? Which areas and merchandise categories do you expect to realize the greatest benefit?\n\n---\n\nYes. The $85 million synergy is cost-driven. In addition of that, we are expecting some top line improvement on a store basis. The synergies will be in all the categories, procurement, operation, G&A. We already have, as Brian mentioned, basically a very solid plan. We're in fact, already basically starting to execute this plan. We'll see 75% will be above the store and 25% basically in the stores, in term of split around the synergies.\n\n---\n\nNext questions are from Irene Nattel, RBC Capital Markets. With regards to the acquisition of The Pantry, can you please provide some color around the source or pace of the forecasted $85 million in synergies? And can you also address your current assessment of the -- of any incremental capital that might be required on systems for renovations, upgrades, lease buy-outs, et cetera?\n\n---\n\nI will say in term of the first portion, I already did mention or answered this. In terms of pace, it will be pretty much basically equal or we'll see a smooth, basically, 2 to 3 years, equally, basically a split over the 2 years. In term of capitals, in addition, of course, of the rebranding, that should create some solid benefit just by refreshing these stores, we will invest in programs to improve the top line. As usual, our investment will be done with the perspective of returns globally, and should be in line with their trend that they had basically in the previous year.\n\n---\n\nNext question. Focusing on merchandise sales and margin trends, what you -- you call out reduced promotional activity in the U.S., shift in mix in Canada and the weather impact in Europe. Can you please provide more color around these factors? And also, what are you seeing in terms of traffic and spending trends as pump prices have fallen?\n\n---\n\nAs I mentioned in the U.S., we are seeing more traffic and more items in the basket. So we're feeling less pressure to promote to drive people in the stores. That ties to the comment that the question was addressing. In Canada, the investment is -- the challenge for traffic is more intense. So we will see continued investment in driving traffic and providing the appropriate level of value, particularly in the tobacco category, which has a great basket around it but does lower overall GP percentage, if the mix of tobacco increases versus the overall sales. In Europe, we've got really 2 offsetting factors. Food is our highest -- one of our highest-margin categories, and it continues to grow. So that's performing well. But we've had a very mild winter in Scandinavia, very little snow. And one of our largest and highest volume, highest-margin categories is the car wash and also windshield washer fluid, which, believe it or not, can be either the #2 or #3 category that we sell in Europe. And those categories have been affected significantly by the milder winter. But we view that the decline that we saw this quarter as an anomaly and don't see it as a trend.\n\n---\n\nThe next question is from Martin Landry, GMP Securities. What is the impact of the weakening of the euro on your earnings per share? Could you give us a sensitivity of the 10% change in the euro to your earnings per share, and a change of 10% in the Norwegian NOK and Swedish krona to the U.S. dollar?\n\n---\n\nA question that sounds simple, but that could be long and complex to answer. I would answer to the -- I will answer to a portion of it and the rest basically, again will be very long to answer fully. I will try to keep it simple for the purpose of this call. For the conversion of our P&L, the conversion in U.S. dollars of our European operation was affected negatively for -- our third quarter was affected negatively by $6.6 million or $0.01 per share. If we look at the FX lost showing on our P&L, it is mainly related to the working cap split. And so then the -- basically the split is a loss of $19.1 million from our operation basically, our European operation, and a gain of $2.5 million with our Canadian operation. And then don't forget that we have a different working capital structure in Europe, concerning the B2B, that is way more material. I would say, it's half of our business on the fuel side. That has some element of impact on the loss because we have some business basically that are invoiced in other currencies than the local currency. But as you can see, it's not a simple one. In term of sensitivity, again, it will be -- or it will be a long answer that I will perhaps have that on a call -- separate calls in order to go a little bit more into details.\n\n---\n\nNext question. Post-acquisition, what market share will you have in Denmark? And do you anticipate having to sell any sites?\n\n---\n\nThere are public sources that give estimates of our market share as well as the other 5 key competitors in the markets. So I'll leave it at that. Yes, we'll start the approval process very shortly with the commission, and we'll await the outcome of that process.\n\n---\n\nNext set of questions are from Peter Sklar, BMO Capital Markets. Can you explain why European merchandising gross margins experienced a decline?\n\n---\n\nI think we answered this one.\n\n---\n\nWe did? Okay. The next question. In yesterday's acquisition announcement, you indicated that Couche-Tard has acquired 151 dealer fuel supply agreements. Can you please explain the structure of a dealer supply agreement? And to what extent do you control fuel economics?\n\n---\n\nFirst, I'll start with we like this business. The dealer business is highly synergistic to our core business of convenience and fuel with minimal capital. This particular transaction, all the relationships with 151 individual sites are branded rack plus a fixed margin for us.\n\n---\n\nNext set of questions are from Michael Van Aelst from TD Securities. SFR's net synergies were $19 million in the quarter, but you said that you were at a group annualized run rate of $140 million. Can you discuss some of the short-term offsetting costs in the $19 million number for that quarter? Also, with the IT integration complete and the run rate almost at the bottom end of the $150 million to $200 million target, are you going -- are you getting enough visibility into the synergy potential at this time to feel confident that you could approach the top end of the target range by December, and maybe go beyond that next year?\n\n---\n\nA long question. Other than the normal inflation and the specific nonrecurring costs that we did refer to in our disclosure, we don't really have any offsetting costs. We are targeting the top of the range by December. And also, as mentioned in the previous -- in the last quarter and the previous quarter even, we will continue after that date, like to create value by improving the efficiency at different levels. And it's not stopping in December. That will be a continuous process.\n\n---\n\nYes, I'd even go beyond targeting. I think there's a very specific list of actions and activities literally by month to achieve. So there's a concrete plan, and we don't see any obstacles to making our December target.\n\n---\n\nNext question. Third quarter fuel margins hit a record high, and I don't think anyone expects them to stay up at that level, but they have also been seen [ph] steadily over the past 5 years on a cents per gallon basis. What do you see as the drivers for this trend? And is there any reason to believe that annual fuel margins on a cents per gallon basis and net of credit card fees would retreat to the levels of 3 to 5 years ago?\n\n---\n\nYes. I would never say something couldn't happen, so I don't believe -- I don't see them going back to historical levels for a sustained period of time. Because I do believe there are some structural reasons to support a higher net cent per gallon basis than we saw in the past. One is just the reality that costs for industry continue to rise. Wages, just general inflation, legislative requirements, investment requirements on the sites. Our industry is still dominated by independents, and that channel is largely losing tobacco sales and also losing fuel gallons. So everything else being equal, they need a higher unit margin to provide an adequate return on investment. And then finally, again, the majors have exited most of the U.S. in the past 5 years, and that's brought mortgages, loans and everything else to the buyers and so. We see those players that acquired those assets needing higher margins to service that debt and generate a return. So again, we think there's some real structural reasons that we'll have them be higher than they have in the past, although, volatility is just a reality in fuel margins in the short term.\n\n---\n\nNext set of questions are from Keith Howlett from Desjardins Securities. Going forward, what do you expect the company's tax rate to be?\n\n---\n\nI think I did already give some color around this point.\n\n---\n\nNext question. What is your view on acquiring terminals or bulk storage facilities in conjunction with retail assets in U.S. and Europe?\n\n---\n\nOperating terminals has become a competency, although it's not core to our business. And I'd say we'll only do it for the right reasons. And the right reason for us is if it creates a strategic advantage in a market and that can manifest itself in cost, it can manifest itself in access to product, or in the ability to blend components and then end up with a cost advantage. Where space is abundant, we'll focus on using third-party solutions as we have in the past.\n\n---\n\nNext set of question from Christopher Li, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Fuel margins in the U.S. increased significantly compared to last year, but yet it was flat in Europe in local currency. What are the main reasons for this discrepancy?\n\n---\n\nThere's 2 primary reasons that we see. One, there's a reality, as Raymond mentioned earlier, that we just carry more inventory in Europe. Probably 2 days more of fuel inventory than we would in North America. So we would have some degree of offsetting negative stock effects as the value of the inventory declined with the spot prices coming down. The bigger reason, though, is it's just a different market with different behavior. If we look at the volatility over all kinds of market conditions, our European margins are just more stable than what we see in North America. So we certainly didn't see the highs that we saw in parts of the U.S., as an example. But nor have we seen over the last almost 3 years some of the lows that we've seen when North America experienced rising crude. So again, I'd say the majority of it's just a difference in how the market behaves.\n\n---\n\nCan you provide us with some color on the components that make up the $85 million cost synergy estimated for The Pantry? Do they include savings from the refinancing debt at the lower interest costs and renegotiation of lease finance obligations?\n\n---\n\nI think we've already answered to this first portion of the question. The second one, no. We -- in the $85 million that we did refer to, we don't really have any -- anything related to the financing structure and the renegotiation of the lease, then -- it's additional, basically opportunity that's...\n\n---\n\nWill put it on the list.\n\n---\n\nThey are in the list, yes.\n\n---\n\nNext set of questions are from Jim Durran, Barclays Capital. Merchandise margins in Canada and Europe were down materially for the quarter year-over-year and also weaker sequentially, which is a change versus the recent trend of market increases in the past 1 or 2 quarters. What was this caused by? Was it tougher environment? Or do you expect the impact of these dynamics to continue for the next -- the foreseeable future?\n\n---\n\nI think I've generally answered it. I'll just repeat a portion. For the Europe, we see the quarter as an anomaly, based on several factors I mentioned earlier. Canada, it will be a little tougher. I'm not saying this quarter is a trend, but certainly there's pressure to continue to provide the right value for our customers and drive traffic. And at least at this point, we don't see that changing like we have in the U.S., or to a lesser degree in Western Canada.\n\n---\n\nNext question. Can you provide us with any revenue and earning numbers for the 2 recently announced acquisitions? And can you provide us with a purchase price for the Shell business?\n\n---\n\nAs our habit, we don't really provide revenues and earnings numbers for nonpublic deals. And usually, it's because of agreements that we have that basically are written that way. And the purchase price for the Shell deal is based -- we didn't disclose it, based on the agreement that we have with the sellers.\n\n---\n\nNext set of questions are from Perry Caicco from CIBC. Can you tell us about the Shell Denmark acquisition -- can you tell us how the Shell Denmark acquisition fits your European strategy, if not already revealed? How does the multiple paid compared to the SFR multiple?\n\n---\n\nAs I said in an earlier question, Denmark is a core market. When I've been asked over the years, where do you want to acquire? Our first preference is always to fill in and build on the strengths in our existing geographies. And this is a classic example of an opportunity to do that. Denmark is highly integrated into Scandinavia, as I said earlier, with B2B business and a lot of cross-border traffic and also somewhat of a geographic bridge from Scandinavia into larger markets in Western Europe that might provide future opportunities for us. It's highly synergistic and again, top quartile assets, which is what we're targeting.\n\n---\n\nNext question. Will there be a significant change in your U.S. gas margins due to your acquisition of The Pantry, and the extra Southeast stores you announced today? Or are these dynamics that could improve gas margins at these new stores?\n\n---\n\nEach margin has its own dynamics, and I can't predict and won't try to predict the future of the margin in any particular area. But looking historically, the Southeast has compared very favorably to our national averages when you look at industry margins. And we're certainly targeting significant synergies on the fuel side of the question as well as we implement our plans.\n\n---\n\nNext set of questions are from Vishal Shreedhar from National Bank Financial. Typically, Couche-Tard U.S. fuel margins exceed OPIS data, however, in the third quarter of 2015, Couche-Tard's fuel margin overperformed -- excuse me, underperformed OPIS data. Was this due to a change in merchandising strategy? Did Couche-Tard strategically lower fuel margins to drive merchandise -- merchandising traffic?\n\n---\n\nI want to be very clear. There has been no change in strategy. It's purely a function, we believe, of regional market behaviors. During this period, some markets were very strong for us, while others like the Midwest were somewhat more normal, if you will. So it's a market by market, but if you look at individual markets, we still think we're very competitively sourcing product and pricing competitively and advantaged overall in the marketplace.\n\n---\n\nNext question. Couche-Tard's European fuel margins in local currency were flat year-over-year. In prior webcasts, management indicated that lower fuel margins would benefit European fuel margins with a lagged effect. Should we still expect European fuel margins to benefit on a delayed basis from a decline in fuel prices? Or has a change in approach negated this benefit?\n\n---\n\nI think we've answered that. No change in approach. We just -- we find that the European margins are just more stable in both up and down crude environments.\n\n---\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes the webcast for today. We hope that we have answered all your questions. Thank you for attention and your interest in Couche-Tard.\n\n---\n\nThanks, everyone.\n\n---\n\nThank you very much. Bye-bye.",
      "transcript_text4": "【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nFirst question is from Patricia Baker, Scotia Capital. Can you share with us any operational metrics on Shell Denmark? How does the performance of those sites compare with the SFR business? And in what manner will we see the operation integrated into the European operation as a whole?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nI'll start with Denmark, being a core market for Couche-Tard. It's right next to Norway, Sweden. A lot of cross-border traffic, B2B business, across all those countries. So it's a great market for us to expand in. We think, with the Shell network, we have the opportunity to create an unparalleled, unmanned offer, automat offer and a full-service convenience offer that's superior to anyone else in the market. When you compare it specifically to networks, Shell has a strong network. In merchandise sales and fuel leaders are materially above the market average and only second to our own in the country. In terms of the integration, it will be fully integrated into our business with the exception of the fuel brand, which we've committed to remain Shell.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nCan you discuss, in general, terms the health of the 3 markets from a consumer and an economy perspective? And how they compare?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nFor us, the trends really haven't changed a lot over the last couple of quarters. The U.S. continues to strengthen, both in sales, customer count and basket and then also fuel gallons. So we're very optimistic. And although some of the press out there would say that the consumer is saving the money not spending it, we think there's clear signs of that business improving for us in the States. Canada, the West continues to be strong, but we are still struggling with softer results in Ontario and Québec. While sales are positive, there's a heavy intense competition for customers, and that's also put some pressure on merchandise margins in the eastern half of the country. In Europe, despite a difficult market, as Raymond mentioned, I think we continue to outperform the market, both driven by our food, which is posting solid growth in really all divisions, and also by fuel, up double -- it's not double-digit, up 2.1% in what I would argue was probably a flat to slightly declining market. So in that context, we really feel good about the results in Europe as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nNext questions are from Derek Dley from Canaccord Genuity. Your tax rate was higher than recent quarters, even after adjusting the $16 million internal reorganization expense. What should we expect as a range for the tax rate going forward, now that you have added additional debt with The Pantry acquisition?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nThe tax rate in Q2 was influenced by this reorganization more materially. It was in fact a true-up, basically, for the entire year. On an annual basis, the tax rate would've been basically around 21% without this element versus a 25% that again we should achieve. And don't quote me on that because again if our taxable income in the U.S. is way higher than last year, this tax rate will have the tendency to go up. But everyone will be happy with that, I'm pretty sure. Next years, the tax rate will be influenced positively, clearly by The Pantry acquisition. Then -- but we again, we're in the budget process, and we need to continue to do our calculation to establish exactly what will be our tax rate for next year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nThe next question. Can you provide some color on your synergy expectations for The Pantry? Which areas and merchandise categories do you expect to realize the greatest benefit?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nYes. The $85 million synergy is cost-driven. In addition of that, we are expecting some top line improvement on a store basis. The synergies will be in all the categories, procurement, operation, G&A. We already have, as Brian mentioned, basically a very solid plan. We're in fact, already basically starting to execute this plan. We'll see 75% will be above the store and 25% basically in the stores, in term of split around the synergies.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nNext questions are from Irene Nattel, RBC Capital Markets. With regards to the acquisition of The Pantry, can you please provide some color around the source or pace of the forecasted $85 million in synergies? And can you also address your current assessment of the -- of any incremental capital that might be required on systems for renovations, upgrades, lease buy-outs, et cetera?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nI will say in term of the first portion, I already did mention or answered this. In terms of pace, it will be pretty much basically equal or we'll see a smooth, basically, 2 to 3 years, equally, basically a split over the 2 years. In term of capitals, in addition, of course, of the rebranding, that should create some solid benefit just by refreshing these stores, we will invest in programs to improve the top line. As usual, our investment will be done with the perspective of returns globally, and should be in line with their trend that they had basically in the previous year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nNext question. Focusing on merchandise sales and margin trends, what you -- you call out reduced promotional activity in the U.S., shift in mix in Canada and the weather impact in Europe. Can you please provide more color around these factors? And also, what are you seeing in terms of traffic and spending trends as pump prices have fallen?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nAs I mentioned in the U.S., we are seeing more traffic and more items in the basket. So we're feeling less pressure to promote to drive people in the stores. That ties to the comment that the question was addressing. In Canada, the investment is -- the challenge for traffic is more intense. So we will see continued investment in driving traffic and providing the appropriate level of value, particularly in the tobacco category, which has a great basket around it but does lower overall GP percentage, if the mix of tobacco increases versus the overall sales. In Europe, we've got really 2 offsetting factors. Food is our highest -- one of our highest-margin categories, and it continues to grow. So that's performing well. But we've had a very mild winter in Scandinavia, very little snow. And one of our largest and highest volume, highest-margin categories is the car wash and also windshield washer fluid, which, believe it or not, can be either the #2 or #3 category that we sell in Europe. And those categories have been affected significantly by the milder winter. But we view that the decline that we saw this quarter as an anomaly and don't see it as a trend.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nThe next question is from Martin Landry, GMP Securities. What is the impact of the weakening of the euro on your earnings per share? Could you give us a sensitivity of the 10% change in the euro to your earnings per share, and a change of 10% in the Norwegian NOK and Swedish krona to the U.S. dollar?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nA question that sounds simple, but that could be long and complex to answer. I would answer to the -- I will answer to a portion of it and the rest basically, again will be very long to answer fully. I will try to keep it simple for the purpose of this call. For the conversion of our P&L, the conversion in U.S. dollars of our European operation was affected negatively for -- our third quarter was affected negatively by $6.6 million or $0.01 per share. If we look at the FX lost showing on our P&L, it is mainly related to the working cap split. And so then the -- basically the split is a loss of $19.1 million from our operation basically, our European operation, and a gain of $2.5 million with our Canadian operation. And then don't forget that we have a different working capital structure in Europe, concerning the B2B, that is way more material. I would say, it's half of our business on the fuel side. That has some element of impact on the loss because we have some business basically that are invoiced in other currencies than the local currency. But as you can see, it's not a simple one. In term of sensitivity, again, it will be -- or it will be a long answer that I will perhaps have that on a call -- separate calls in order to go a little bit more into details.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nNext question. Post-acquisition, what market share will you have in Denmark? And do you anticipate having to sell any sites?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nThere are public sources that give estimates of our market share as well as the other 5 key competitors in the markets. So I'll leave it at that. Yes, we'll start the approval process very shortly with the commission, and we'll await the outcome of that process.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nNext set of questions are from Peter Sklar, BMO Capital Markets. Can you explain why European merchandising gross margins experienced a decline?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nI think we answered this one.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nWe did? Okay. The next question. In yesterday's acquisition announcement, you indicated that Couche-Tard has acquired 151 dealer fuel supply agreements. Can you please explain the structure of a dealer supply agreement? And to what extent do you control fuel economics?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nFirst, I'll start with we like this business. The dealer business is highly synergistic to our core business of convenience and fuel with minimal capital. This particular transaction, all the relationships with 151 individual sites are branded rack plus a fixed margin for us.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nNext set of questions are from Michael Van Aelst from TD Securities. SFR's net synergies were $19 million in the quarter, but you said that you were at a group annualized run rate of $140 million. Can you discuss some of the short-term offsetting costs in the $19 million number for that quarter? Also, with the IT integration complete and the run rate almost at the bottom end of the $150 million to $200 million target, are you going -- are you getting enough visibility into the synergy potential at this time to feel confident that you could approach the top end of the target range by December, and maybe go beyond that next year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nA long question. Other than the normal inflation and the specific nonrecurring costs that we did refer to in our disclosure, we don't really have any offsetting costs. We are targeting the top of the range by December. And also, as mentioned in the previous -- in the last quarter and the previous quarter even, we will continue after that date, like to create value by improving the efficiency at different levels. And it's not stopping in December. That will be a continuous process.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nYes, I'd even go beyond targeting. I think there's a very specific list of actions and activities literally by month to achieve. So there's a concrete plan, and we don't see any obstacles to making our December target.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nNext question. Third quarter fuel margins hit a record high, and I don't think anyone expects them to stay up at that level, but they have also been seen [ph] steadily over the past 5 years on a cents per gallon basis. What do you see as the drivers for this trend? And is there any reason to believe that annual fuel margins on a cents per gallon basis and net of credit card fees would retreat to the levels of 3 to 5 years ago?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nYes. I would never say something couldn't happen, so I don't believe -- I don't see them going back to historical levels for a sustained period of time. Because I do believe there are some structural reasons to support a higher net cent per gallon basis than we saw in the past. One is just the reality that costs for industry continue to rise. Wages, just general inflation, legislative requirements, investment requirements on the sites. Our industry is still dominated by independents, and that channel is largely losing tobacco sales and also losing fuel gallons. So everything else being equal, they need a higher unit margin to provide an adequate return on investment. And then finally, again, the majors have exited most of the U.S. in the past 5 years, and that's brought mortgages, loans and everything else to the buyers and so. We see those players that acquired those assets needing higher margins to service that debt and generate a return. So again, we think there's some real structural reasons that we'll have them be higher than they have in the past, although, volatility is just a reality in fuel margins in the short term.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nNext set of questions are from Keith Howlett from Desjardins Securities. Going forward, what do you expect the company's tax rate to be?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Raymond Paré (Executives)】\nI think I did already give some color around this point.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nNext question.

And I'd say we'll only do it for the right reasons. And the right reason for us is if it creates a strategic advantage in a market and that can manifest itself in cost, it can manifest itself in access to product, or in the ability to blend components and then end up with a cost advantage. Where space is abundant, we'll focus on using third-party solutions as we have in the past.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nNext set of question from Christopher Li, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Fuel margins in the U.S. increased significantly compared to last year, but yet it was flat in Europe in local currency. What are the main reasons for this discrepancy?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Brian Hannasch (Executives)】\nThere's 2 primary reasons that we see. One, there's a reality, as Raymond mentioned earlier, that we just carry more inventory in Europe. Probably 2 days more of fuel inventory than we would in North America. So we would have some degree of offsetting negative stock effects as the value of the inventory declined with the spot prices coming down. The bigger reason, though, is it's just a different market with different behavior. If we look at the volatility over all kinds of market conditions, our European margins are just more stable than what we see in North America. So we certainly didn't see the highs that we saw in parts of the U.S., as an example. But nor have we seen over the last almost 3 years some of the lows that we've seen when North America experienced rising crude. So again, I'd say the majority of it's just a difference in how the market behaves.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nCan you provide us with some color on the components that make up the $85 million cost synergy estimated for The Pantry?

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.\r\nRegarding the second quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, is available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.\r\nTo begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for delivering another solid quarter. We remain focused on several key initiatives and on growing our business on a variety of fronts. We've diversified our portfolio somewhat in recent years with an emphasis on building additional legs of growth for the future.\r\nOur Retail domestic business, which generates approximately 70% of our revenues, performed well in Q2. And we continue to see opportunities for future growth in store count and same-store sales.\r\nSecondly, our Commercial domestic business, which has been growing sales by double-digits for 5 years, accelerated its growth in Q2 and continues to be a tremendous growth opportunity.\r\nRegarding our international operations, we've been doing business in Mexico since late 1998, and our model has proven to work quite well. In Brazil, we are still in test phase, but our sales have continued to grow nicely. As with other international companies, the strengthening dollar has negatively impacted our U.S. dollar earnings from these operations recently.\r\nOur Internet businesses, autozone.com and AutoAnything, continue to grow nicely and generally consistent with our expectations. ALLDATA, which is the leading diagnostic and repair business in the United States, continues to perform well, although our growth in that business has slowed as the market has become more competitive in recent years and as our market share has reached all-time highs.\r\nAnd finally, IMC, an imports parts specialist that we acquired in the fall, has begun the integration process we are work -- where we are working to expand their footprint of branches and where we are working to leverage their inventory assortment across the AutoZone domestic store base.\r\nThis past quarter, our U.S. Retail business expanded with the opening of 36 net new stores. We also opened 29 net new commercial programs. Our Commercial business continued to gain traction, growing sales 14.5% for the quarter. We had the commercial programs in 78% of our domestic stores, having opened approximately 800 new programs in just the past 2 years. Additionally, we opened 5 stores in Mexico during the quarter. In Brazil, we continue to operate 5 stores and expect to open a couple of new ones over the next few months. We currently have 8% of our total stores outside the United States. Finally, we opened our first IMC branch since we acquired the company. And we are in the final stages of relocating their East Coast distribution center. We believe we have growth opportunities on a variety of fronts in the United States and outside the U.S. for many years to come.\r\nAs mentioned on our last conference call, during our first fiscal quarter, our sales continued to gain momentum throughout the quarter. And then the last 2 weeks, due to the first significant cold weather, our sales grew significantly. Due to last year's very strong Q2 sales, up 4.3% on a same-store basis, the comparisons for this past quarter were challenging. We were quite pleased with our performance throughout the second quarter, especially in light of the difficult comparisons. And we ended the quarter with domestic same-store sales of 3.6%. This represents more than 200 basis points improvement on a 2-year rolling same-store basis from last quarter. We were pleased to see we gained traction in sales categories where we've added merchandise. And our Commercial business benefited from both the inventory additions and the diligent focus on growing sales in our older programs with particular emphasis on mature customers.\r\nOur results were strongest in the West, South and South Central states, and were weakest in the Northeast and Midwestern markets. These weaker markets performed quite well last year with the extremely cold winter, and we knew the comparisons this year would be difficult. While our cold weather-related categories didn't perform as well as last year, they continued to perform well under the circumstances and, as anticipated, our maintenance-related categories performed quite well in the quarter. Our belief is the improvement in maintenance category sales was driven by more conducive weather patterns, improved merchandise assortments due to the products we have added over the last year and lower gas prices, which we believe is relieving some pressure, particularly on our most economically challenged customers.\r\nIn recent years, we have experienced a significant growth in our sales concurrent with the U.S. tax refund season. We believe our most economically challenged customers use their refunds to make repairs and enhancements to their vehicles that they have deferred for some time. Each year, the exact timing of tax refunds moves a bit, and those moves occur at the very end of our second quarter or at the beginning of our third quarter.\r\nIf you recall, in fiscal 2013, we cited the delays in tax refunds that caused a material reduction in our sales the last 2 weeks of the quarter, where we saw 8% decline in same-store sales for those 2 weeks. This year, refunds began earlier and helped our business, particularly in the second to last week of the quarter. This 1 week added about 100 basis points to our same-store sales for the quarter.\r\nOverall, we were quite pleased with our sales performance in Q2. Our inventory per location increased over our Q1 2015 levels. The primary driver of this increase was timing. We typically experience an increase in inventory as we prepare for the spring selling season. We anticipate that inventory levels will decline somewhat as this merchandise sells over the balance of the next 2 quarters.\r\nAdditionally, the IMC acquisition has increased our inventory per store across the chain by $11,000 per store. IMC branches carry approximately 10x the inventory per location that an average AutoZone store carries. So their volumes, on a per location basis, are materially higher as well.\r\nAs we mentioned during the last several quarterly calls, we have been testing different delivery frequencies from our distribution centers. Our ongoing tests show us that increased delivery frequency increases sales and improves inventory productivity by reducing safety stock. We've been running tests in just over 150 stores for approximately a year. And based on the success of our initial results, during the second quarter, we made the decision to expand the test to more than 300 additional stores. These stores were added to the test in the last couple of weeks of the second quarter and the first week of the third quarter. We now have a test in approximately 10% of our domestic change, which we believe gives us a substantial base of stores to assess performance.\r\nThe results to date show a nice, low single-digit lift in sales. But we aren't prepared yet to determine our long-term strategy. We still have a significant amount to learn, including the optimal number of deliveries each store should receive weekly. It could be 3, 4, 5 times, or more. Ultimately, assuming our current findings continue, we would expect to increase the delivery frequency to most of our stores, and we would expect to add 2 to 3 additional distribution centers to do this cost effectively and timely.\r\nIf we ultimately elect to increase the delivery frequency to our stores, we will increase our capital expenditures, primarily for the new distribution centers, but we will also add annual operating expenses. Our modeling to date, based on our current results, shows that while it is somewhat dilutive to gross and operating margins over the long term, it is sufficiently additive to operating profit dollars and provides us with returns above our internal hurdle rate.\r\nWe've been pleased with our learnings to date, and we are excited to expand our test to hopefully improve on our results and confirm our expectations.\r\nAdditionally, we have been testing what we call MegaHubs. MegaHubs have substantially increased product assortments, and they leverage those increased product assortments across other hub networks, providing stores across a large geography access to this expanded assortment. We've been testing 2 MegaHubs for about a year. Based on the encouraging results we have seen to date, we are expanding the MegaHub program by an additional 3 locations, which should open over the balance of our fiscal year. Once these 3 locations are open, 35% of our domestic store base will have access to these expanded inventory assortments. If these 3 additional MegaHubs meet or exceed our expectations, we will develop a long-term strategy to roll out MegaHubs to provide service to the majority of our domestic stores.\r\nAll of our inventory availability initiatives are designed to significantly increase our ability to meet our customers' needs. As our Commercial business has grown and our DIY customers' need increase, our need for expanded parts assortment continue. This has been important and difficult work, and I'd like to thank everyone in the organization that has been involved with this initiative for their excellent work.\r\nNow I'll take a moment to discuss our recently completed acquisition of Interamerican Motor Corporation. IMC is the second-largest distributor of OE quality import replacement parts in the United States. They specialize in parts coverage for European and Asian cars. While considerably smaller than the #1 participant in the industry, IMC, now with 18 branches, offers an impressive growth opportunity for us, not just because of the parts coverage but also because of the very strong management team. While it's premature, I will mention our plans include opening more IMC branches and incorporating their parts catalog into the AutoZone Z-net parts catalog. We will continue to go to market as IMC, and we expect to open a handful of new IMC locations over the next 12 months.\r\nThis past January, we made the IMC catalog available to a small number of AutoZone stores near an IMC location. Thus far, while really early, we are pleased. We have seen a lift in those stores' commercial sales that encourages us that our assumptions on the sales lift to AutoZone from cross-selling were correct. In fact, we're slightly ahead of our original sales assumptions, again, in a statistically insignificant number of AutoZone stores. But so far so good.\r\nLet me stress, the IMC brand is very important to us, and we will grow the brand and its presence in the future in many more markets than it is in today. IMC has been in a growth mode recently and has built an infrastructure to support a substantially larger footprint. It currently doesn't enjoy the operating margins that we experience, so it will lower our overall EBIT margins by approximately 40 basis points on an annual basis. We are very excited to have the great IMC team as part of our organization and very optimistic about our future together. The IMC team has embraced the acquisition by AutoZone, and we all are very excited about the future of our 2 companies together as this acquisition makes both of us stronger.\r\nNow let's turn to our second quarter results. Our sales increased 7.7% and our domestic same-store sales were up 3.6%. Both Retail and Commercial experienced positive same-store sales growth. Our same-stores fluctuated from week-to-week due to the wild swings in weather patterns that occur this time of year. The overall trajectory of our business was quite consistent throughout most of the quarter. That consistency was across all regions of the country. We believe we benefited from macro tailwinds, our work on inventory availability and on solid execution.\r\nWhile our failure-related and maintenance merchandise categories performed well, we were especially happy to see the growth in our maintenance categories.\r\nRegarding traffic versus ticket in our DIY business, traffic was slightly negative while ticket was positive. Interestingly, the Northeast and Midwest experienced declines in customer count around 5%, while the rest of the country was positive, together, blending to be down slightly. The comparison to last year's extreme cold in the Northern market was a big contributor to this year being a difficult comparison.\r\nOur average ticket grew generally consistent with the first quarter when it returned to more normalized levels after about a year of subdued growth. The hard parts additions we've added to our stores have helped drive ticket growth.\r\nWhile improvement in product quality has pressured traffic over the last couple of decades, the technology advancement has significantly increased the price of the products we sell. We've been managing through this phenomenon, as mentioned, for over 2 decades and expect to continue to do so.\r\nWe opened 29 new commercial programs in the quarter versus 49 programs in the comparable period last year. We now have a commercial program in 78% of our domestic store base. Our Commercial sales, excluding IMC, were up 14.5% this quarter. Our productivity per program showed a nice uptick this past quarter. We've intensified our focus on mature program growth and, specifically, mature customer growth. And it was encouraging to see the improvements that began in Q1 further accelerate in Q2.\r\nRegarding Mexico, we opened 5 stores this quarter. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 9.2% over last year's second quarter. As a reminder, ALLDATA and eCommerce, which includes autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales.\r\nRegarding online sales, there continue to be great opportunities for growth on both a business-to-business basis and to the individual consumers or B2C. While these businesses are small for us at just 4% of our total sales mix on the quarter, we expect these businesses to grow at a faster rate than our brick-and-mortar business for the foreseeable future.\r\nWith the continued aging of the car population and with gas prices, on average, down materially year-over-year for the second quarter, we are beginning to see miles driven increase. Declining prices at the pump have benefited our customers, especially those most financially strapped. The lower end consumer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging, but we understand this is just one of the many factors that impact our business.\r\nOur operating theme for 2015 is \"WOW! Every Customer Everywhere\", and our key priorities for the year are: one, Great People Providing Great Service!; two, profitably growing our Commercial business; three, leveraging the Internet; four, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies; and five, improving inventory availability.\r\nOn the retail front last quarter under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. Along with improvements to our product assortment, we're incorporating more training tools to help our store AutoZoners to provide trustworthy advice. Training will continue to be a large effort for us at the store level.\r\nBehind-the-scenes, we have increased our technology investment and challenged ourselves to make sure our offerings are relevant across all shopping platforms. We realize that as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. It is imperative we continue to invest in both current and future technologies in order to drive sales growth across all businesses.\r\nAdditionally, during the quarter, we completed our second-ever company-wide engagement survey. We completed our first survey in the fall of 2012 and had terrific results. This year, our results were even better, which is a great testament to our culture and to the terrific leaders we have on our team. It is so encouraging that our AutoZoners not only know they work for a great organization, but they are highly engaged in that work and feel proud to work for this great company we call AutoZone.\r\nOur AutoZoners are the most valuable asset we have.\r\nIn regards to Commercial, we opened 29 programs during the quarter and 90 year-to-date. We expect to open approximately 300 programs this year versus 424 last year. As we continue to improve our product assortment and availability, and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the sales potential will continue to increase. Our results continue to provide us with confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative.\r\nWe should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish Q2 at 31.2%. We are very pleased with this metric, as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hard lines retailing. However, our primary focus has been, and continues to be, that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship, as the capital we invest is our investors' capital.\r\nBefore I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to recognize our entire organization for their incredible efforts to deliver another strong quarter of solid financial results while providing WOW! Customer Service to all of our customers. Now, here's Bill.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone.\r\nTo start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our Retail, Commercial and international results.\r\nFor the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Retail and Commercial businesses, IMC, our Mexico stores and our 5 stores in Brazil, increased 7.6%.\r\nRegarding macro trends during the quarter. Nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $2.82 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.27 a gallon, a $0.55 increase (sic) [ decrease ]. Last year, gas prices increased $0.15 per gallon during the second quarter, starting out at $3.29 and ending at $3.44 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' ability to maintain their vehicles. And as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to benefit from some increase in disposable income.\r\nWe also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than our newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 1% in November. Data for December and January isn't currently available. The other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. For the trailing 4 quarters, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,753,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry.\r\nFor the quarter, total commercial sales increased 14.5%. Commercial represented 17% of our total sales compared to 16% last year and grew $47 million over last year's second quarter. We opened 29 new programs during the quarter versus 49 programs opened in our second quarter last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 3,935 stores supported by 171 hub stores. Approximately 1,100 of our programs are 3 years old or younger.\r\nAs Bill has mentioned earlier, both our total commercial sales and sales per program accelerated from the previous quarter's results. While our average sales per program is below some peers in our industry, we feel we are on the right track to methodically close that gap. It's important to highlight that we accelerated our new program growth over the past few years. As approximately 30% of our programs are younger than 3 years old, these openings have impacted our average sales metric and cannibalized some of our older programs. However, our focus is on growing market share and improving our service levels by having more programs closer to our customers.\r\nLooking specifically at our mature programs, those at least 5 years old, they grew in the mid-single-digit range this past quarter. Additionally, we still have significant opportunities to open additional programs over the next several years. We feel good about the success we've had on profitably growing the Commercial business. \r\nIn summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We believe the improvements we have made and upcoming additional improvements from our inventory availability initiatives enhance our prospects. And we believe the addition of IMC will provide us with more avenues to service our commercial customers very effectively. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share.\r\nOur Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 5 new stores during the second quarter. We currently have 411 stores in Mexico. As the U.S. dollar strengthened this past quarter, we did have an FX conversion headwind. However, we still delivered a solid U.S. dollar-equivalent EBIT result and felt good about being able to handle the currency weakening in regard to the overall impact to the company's results. We expect to open a similar number of stores in Mexico this fiscal year that we opened last year. Our returns and profit growth continue to be in line with our expectations.\r\nRegarding Brazil. We are currently operating 5 stores. We expect to open a few more stores over the next several months and then refine our offerings and prove that our concept works for our customers and is financially viable. Once we refine our offerings and operations and evaluate the performance, we will provide you with an update on our long-term growth plans.\r\nRecapping this past quarter's performance for the company. In total, our sales were $2,144,000,000, an increase of 7.7%. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores open more than 1 year were up 3.6% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.2% of sales, up 15 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, partially offset by the impact from Interamerican Motor Corporation, which was acquired during September 2014.\r\nLooking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for merchandise gross margin expansion within both the Retail and Commercial businesses. The pressure we will experience in the IMC business, along with the rollout of further stores on more frequent deliveries from our distribution centers, will continue to cause headwinds to our overall gross margin rate. However, our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.\r\nSG&A for the quarter was 35.4% of sales, 25 basis points higher than last year's second quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was due to higher incentive compensation, impact from the IMC acquisition and self-insured employee medical costs. Partially offsetting these items was a favorable credit card litigation settlement of $5.4 million recognized during the quarter.\r\nWhile we have invested in several key initiatives that are customer service-related, like training and systems upgrades, we believe we are well-positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.\r\nEBIT for the quarter was $361 million, up 7.1% over last year's second quarter. Our EBIT margin was down 10 basis points at 16.9%. Interest expense for the quarter was $34.5 million compared with $39.5 million in Q2 a year ago. Debt outstanding as of end of the quarter was $4.4 billion or approximately $125 million more than last year's balance of $4.3 billion.\r\nOur adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While at any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.\r\nFor the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.2%, in line with last year's second quarter. We expect our annual rate to be closer to 36.5% on an ongoing basis, as the deviation in results this quarter, like last year, was primarily driven by the government tax credits reinstituted in December of 2014.\r\nNet income for the quarter was $212 million, up 9.8%. Our diluted share count of 32.5 million shares was down 5% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $6.51, up 15.6% over the prior year's second quarter.\r\nRelating to the cash flow statement for the second fiscal quarter. Our operating cash flow was $101 million. Net fixed assets were up 7.7% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $93.8 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 44 new stores this quarter. Capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodels, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments.\r\nWith the new stores open, we finished this past quarter with 5,042 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 411 stores in Mexico; 18 IMC branches; and 5 stores in Brazil for a total location count of 5,476.\r\nDepreciation totaled $59.9 million for the quarter versus last year's second quarter expense of $58 million. This is in line with recent quarter growth rates.\r\nWith our excess cash flow, we repurchased $26 million of AutoZone stock in the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had $544 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5x. Again, I want to stress we manage to appropriate credit ratings, not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating agency firm has its own criteria.\r\nWe continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy.\r\nAccounts payable as a percentage of gross inventory finished the quarter at 107.5%. The inclusion of IMC reduced the AP ratio by 170 basis points.\r\nNext, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $3.5 billion, up 12% versus the Q2 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects the recent IMC acquisition, new store growth and additional investments and coverage. Inventory per store was up 7.1% at $631,000 per store, reflecting our continued investments in hard parts coverage and the IMC acquisition. The increase in inventory per store this quarter due to the IMC acquisition was $11,000 per store.\r\nFinally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on investment capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 31.2%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.\r\nNow I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Bill. We are pleased this morning to report our 34th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, growing this quarter at a rate of 15.6%. Our company has continued to be successful over the long run. That success is attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. At the end of the day, our customers have choices, and we must innovate to ensure they turn to us for their vehicle solution needs.\r\nAs we continue to invest in our businesses and monitor the results from our ongoing inventory initiatives, we are optimistic about our future. We feel like we continue to be on the right track. Again, we are excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment, supply chain solutions, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, eCommerce, Brazil and now, IMC.\r\nOur long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our Commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we routinely look to grow our EBIT dollars in the mid-single digit range or better in times of strength, And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth in the double-digits.\r\nWe feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid, consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success.\r\nOur charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and to continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We are pleased with our results this past quarter, but we must remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives.\r\nNow we'd like to open up the call for questions.",

With me today are Bill Giles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, IT and ALLDATA; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.\r\nRegarding the second quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, is available on our website, www.autozoneinc.com. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.\r\nTo begin this morning, I want to thank all AutoZoners across the globe for delivering another solid quarter. We remain focused on several key initiatives and on growing our business on a variety of fronts. We've diversified our portfolio somewhat in recent years with an emphasis on building additional legs of growth for the future.\r\nOur Retail domestic business, which generates approximately 70% of our revenues, performed well in Q2. And we continue to see opportunities for future growth in store count and same-store sales.\r\nSecondly, our Commercial domestic business, which has been growing sales by double-digits for 5 years, accelerated its growth in Q2 and continues to be a tremendous growth opportunity.\r\nRegarding our international operations, we've been doing business in Mexico since late 1998, and our model has proven to work quite well. In Brazil, we are still in test phase, but our sales have continued to grow nicely. As with other international companies, the strengthening dollar has negatively impacted our U.S. dollar earnings from these operations recently.\r\nOur Internet businesses, autozone.com and AutoAnything, continue to grow nicely and generally consistent with our expectations. ALLDATA, which is the leading diagnostic and repair business in the United States, continues to perform well, although our growth in that business has slowed as the market has become more competitive in recent years and as our market share has reached all-time highs.\r\nAnd finally, IMC, an imports parts specialist that we acquired in the fall, has begun the integration process we are work -- where we are working to expand their footprint of branches and where we are working to leverage their inventory assortment across the AutoZone domestic store base.\r\nThis past quarter, our U.S. Retail business expanded with the opening of 36 net new stores. We also opened 29 net new commercial programs. Our Commercial business continued to gain traction, growing sales 14.5% for the quarter. We had the commercial programs in 78% of our domestic stores, having opened approximately 800 new programs in just the past 2 years. Additionally, we opened 5 stores in Mexico during the quarter. In Brazil, we continue to operate 5 stores and expect to open a couple of new ones over the next few months. We currently have 8% of our total stores outside the United States. Finally, we opened our first IMC branch since we acquired the company. And we are in the final stages of relocating their East Coast distribution center. We believe we have growth opportunities on a variety of fronts in the United States and outside the U.S. for many years to come.\r\nAs mentioned on our last conference call, during our first fiscal quarter, our sales continued to gain momentum throughout the quarter. And then the last 2 weeks, due to the first significant cold weather, our sales grew significantly. Due to last year's very strong Q2 sales, up 4.3% on a same-store basis, the comparisons for this past quarter were challenging. We were quite pleased with our performance throughout the second quarter, especially in light of the difficult comparisons. And we ended the quarter with domestic same-store sales of 3.6%. This represents more than 200 basis points improvement on a 2-year rolling same-store basis from last quarter. We were pleased to see we gained traction in sales categories where we've added merchandise. And our Commercial business benefited from both the inventory additions and the diligent focus on growing sales in our older programs with particular emphasis on mature customers.\r\nOur results were strongest in the West, South and South Central states, and were weakest in the Northeast and Midwestern markets. These weaker markets performed quite well last year with the extremely cold winter, and we knew the comparisons this year would be difficult. While our cold weather-related categories didn't perform as well as last year, they continued to perform well under the circumstances and, as anticipated, our maintenance-related categories performed quite well in the quarter. Our belief is the improvement in maintenance category sales was driven by more conducive weather patterns, improved merchandise assortments due to the products we have added over the last year and lower gas prices, which we believe is relieving some pressure, particularly on our most economically challenged customers.\r\nIn recent years, we have experienced a significant growth in our sales concurrent with the U.S. tax refund season. We believe our most economically challenged customers use their refunds to make repairs and enhancements to their vehicles that they have deferred for some time. Each year, the exact timing of tax refunds moves a bit, and those moves occur at the very end of our second quarter or at the beginning of our third quarter.\r\nIf you recall, in fiscal 2013, we cited the delays in tax refunds that caused a material reduction in our sales the last 2 weeks of the quarter, where we saw 8% decline in same-store sales for those 2 weeks. This year, refunds began earlier and helped our business, particularly in the second to last week of the quarter. This 1 week added about 100 basis points to our same-store sales for the quarter.\r\nOverall, we were quite pleased with our sales performance in Q2. Our inventory per location increased over our Q1 2015 levels. The primary driver of this increase was timing. We typically experience an increase in inventory as we prepare for the spring selling season. We anticipate that inventory levels will decline somewhat as this merchandise sells over the balance of the next 2 quarters.\r\nAdditionally, the IMC acquisition has increased our inventory per store across the chain by $11,000 per store. IMC branches carry approximately 10x the inventory per location that an average AutoZone store carries. So their volumes, on a per location basis, are materially higher as well.\r\nAs we mentioned during the last several quarterly calls, we have been testing different delivery frequencies from our distribution centers. Our ongoing tests show us that increased delivery frequency increases sales and improves inventory productivity by reducing safety stock. We've been running tests in just over 150 stores for approximately a year. And based on the success of our initial results, during the second quarter, we made the decision to expand the test to more than 300 additional stores. These stores were added to the test in the last couple of weeks of the second quarter and the first week of the third quarter. We now have a test in approximately 10% of our domestic change, which we believe gives us a substantial base of stores to assess performance.\r\nThe results to date show a nice, low single-digit lift in sales. But we aren't prepared yet to determine our long-term strategy. We still have a significant amount to learn, including the optimal number of deliveries each store should receive weekly. It could be 3, 4, 5 times, or more. Ultimately, assuming our current findings continue, we would expect to increase the delivery frequency to most of our stores, and we would expect to add 2 to 3 additional distribution centers to do this cost effectively and timely.\r\nIf we ultimately elect to increase the delivery frequency to our stores, we will increase our capital expenditures, primarily for the new distribution centers, but we will also add annual operating expenses. Our modeling to date, based on our current results, shows that while it is somewhat dilutive to gross and operating margins over the long term, it is sufficiently additive to operating profit dollars and provides us with returns above our internal hurdle rate.\r\nWe've been pleased with our learnings to date, and we are excited to expand our test to hopefully improve on our results and confirm our expectations.\r\nAdditionally, we have been testing what we call MegaHubs. MegaHubs have substantially increased product assortments, and they leverage those increased product assortments across other hub networks, providing stores across a large geography access to this expanded assortment. We've been testing 2 MegaHubs for about a year. Based on the encouraging results we have seen to date, we are expanding the MegaHub program by an additional 3 locations, which should open over the balance of our fiscal year. Once these 3 locations are open, 35% of our domestic store base will have access to these expanded inventory assortments. If these 3 additional MegaHubs meet or exceed our expectations, we will develop a long-term strategy to roll out MegaHubs to provide service to the majority of our domestic stores.\r\nAll of our inventory availability initiatives are designed to significantly increase our ability to meet our customers' needs. As our Commercial business has grown and our DIY customers' need increase, our need for expanded parts assortment continue. This has been important and difficult work, and I'd like to thank everyone in the organization that has been involved with this initiative for their excellent work.\r\nNow I'll take a moment to discuss our recently completed acquisition of Interamerican Motor Corporation. IMC is the second-largest distributor of OE quality import replacement parts in the United States. They specialize in parts coverage for European and Asian cars. While considerably smaller than the #1 participant in the industry, IMC, now with 18 branches, offers an impressive growth opportunity for us, not just because of the parts coverage but also because of the very strong management team. While it's premature, I will mention our plans include opening more IMC branches and incorporating their parts catalog into the AutoZone Z-net parts catalog. We will continue to go to market as IMC, and we expect to open a handful of new IMC locations over the next 12 months.\r\nThis past January, we made the IMC catalog available to a small number of AutoZone stores near an IMC location. Thus far, while really early, we are pleased. We have seen a lift in those stores' commercial sales that encourages us that our assumptions on the sales lift to AutoZone from cross-selling were correct. In fact, we're slightly ahead of our original sales assumptions, again, in a statistically insignificant number of AutoZone stores. But so far so good.\r\nLet me stress, the IMC brand is very important to us, and we will grow the brand and its presence in the future in many more markets than it is in today. IMC has been in a growth mode recently and has built an infrastructure to support a substantially larger footprint. It currently doesn't enjoy the operating margins that we experience, so it will lower our overall EBIT margins by approximately 40 basis points on an annual basis. We are very excited to have the great IMC team as part of our organization and very optimistic about our future together. The IMC team has embraced the acquisition by AutoZone, and we all are very excited about the future of our 2 companies together as this acquisition makes both of us stronger.\r\nNow let's turn to our second quarter results. Our sales increased 7.7% and our domestic same-store sales were up 3.6%. Both Retail and Commercial experienced positive same-store sales growth. Our same-stores fluctuated from week-to-week due to the wild swings in weather patterns that occur this time of year. The overall trajectory of our business was quite consistent throughout most of the quarter. That consistency was across all regions of the country. We believe we benefited from macro tailwinds, our work on inventory availability and on solid execution.\r\nWhile our failure-related and maintenance merchandise categories performed well, we were especially happy to see the growth in our maintenance categories.\r\nRegarding traffic versus ticket in our DIY business, traffic was slightly negative while ticket was positive. Interestingly, the Northeast and Midwest experienced declines in customer count around 5%, while the rest of the country was positive, together, blending to be down slightly. The comparison to last year's extreme cold in the Northern market was a big contributor to this year being a difficult comparison.\r\nOur average ticket grew generally consistent with the first quarter when it returned to more normalized levels after about a year of subdued growth. The hard parts additions we've added to our stores have helped drive ticket growth.\r\nWhile improvement in product quality has pressured traffic over the last couple of decades, the technology advancement has significantly increased the price of the products we sell. We've been managing through this phenomenon, as mentioned, for over 2 decades and expect to continue to do so.\r\nWe opened 29 new commercial programs in the quarter versus 49 programs in the comparable period last year. We now have a commercial program in 78% of our domestic store base. Our Commercial sales, excluding IMC, were up 14.5% this quarter. Our productivity per program showed a nice uptick this past quarter. We've intensified our focus on mature program growth and, specifically, mature customer growth. And it was encouraging to see the improvements that began in Q1 further accelerate in Q2.\r\nRegarding Mexico, we opened 5 stores this quarter. Sales in our other businesses for the quarter were up 9.2% over last year's second quarter. As a reminder, ALLDATA and eCommerce, which includes autozone.com and AutoAnything, make up this segment of sales.\r\nRegarding online sales, there continue to be great opportunities for growth on both a business-to-business basis and to the individual consumers or B2C. While these businesses are small for us at just 4% of our total sales mix on the quarter, we expect these businesses to grow at a faster rate than our brick-and-mortar business for the foreseeable future.\r\nWith the continued aging of the car population and with gas prices, on average, down materially year-over-year for the second quarter, we are beginning to see miles driven increase. Declining prices at the pump have benefited our customers, especially those most financially strapped. The lower end consumer benefits the most from lower gas prices relative to income. This trend is encouraging, but we understand this is just one of the many factors that impact our business.\r\nOur operating theme for 2015 is \"WOW! Every Customer Everywhere\", and our key priorities for the year are: one, Great People Providing Great Service!; two, profitably growing our Commercial business; three, leveraging the Internet; four, leveraging technology to improve the customer experience while optimizing efficiencies; and five, improving inventory availability.\r\nOn the retail front last quarter under the Great People Providing Great Service! theme, we continued with our intense focus on improving execution. Along with improvements to our product assortment, we're incorporating more training tools to help our store AutoZoners to provide trustworthy advice. Training will continue to be a large effort for us at the store level.\r\nBehind-the-scenes, we have increased our technology investment and challenged ourselves to make sure our offerings are relevant across all shopping platforms. We realize that as customers have become much more tech and mobile savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us. It is imperative we continue to invest in both current and future technologies in order to drive sales growth across all businesses.\r\nAdditionally, during the quarter, we completed our second-ever company-wide engagement survey. We completed our first survey in the fall of 2012 and had terrific results. This year, our results were even better, which is a great testament to our culture and to the terrific leaders we have on our team. It is so encouraging that our AutoZoners not only know they work for a great organization, but they are highly engaged in that work and feel proud to work for this great company we call AutoZone.\r\nOur AutoZoners are the most valuable asset we have.\r\nIn regards to Commercial, we opened 29 programs during the quarter and 90 year-to-date. We expect to open approximately 300 programs this year versus 424 last year. As we continue to improve our product assortment and availability, and as we make other refinements to our offerings, we expect that the sales potential will continue to increase. Our results continue to provide us with confidence to be aggressive in adding additional resources and new programs to this important growth initiative.\r\nWe should also highlight another strong performance in return on invested capital, as we were able to finish Q2 at 31.2%. We are very pleased with this metric, as it is one of the best, if not the best, in all of hard lines retailing. However, our primary focus has been, and continues to be, that we ensure every incremental dollar of capital that we deploy in this business provides an acceptable return well in excess of our cost of capital. It is important to reinforce that we will always maintain our diligence regarding capital stewardship, as the capital we invest is our investors' capital.\r\nBefore I pass the discussion over to Bill Giles to talk about our financial results, I'd like to recognize our entire organization for their incredible efforts to deliver another strong quarter of solid financial results while providing WOW! Customer Service to all of our customers. Now, here's Bill.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: William Giles (Executives)】\nThanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone.\r\nTo start this morning, let me take a few moments to talk more specifically about our Retail, Commercial and international results.\r\nFor the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Retail and Commercial businesses, IMC, our Mexico stores and our 5 stores in Brazil, increased 7.6%.\r\nRegarding macro trends during the quarter. Nationally, unleaded gas prices started out at $2.82 a gallon and ended the quarter at $2.27 a gallon, a $0.55 increase (sic) [ decrease ]. Last year, gas prices increased $0.15 per gallon during the second quarter, starting out at $3.29 and ending at $3.44 a gallon. We continue to believe gas prices have a real impact on our customers' ability to maintain their vehicles. And as cost reductions help all Americans, we hope to benefit from some increase in disposable income.\r\nWe also recognize that the impact of miles driven on cars over 10 years old, the current average, is much different than our newer cars in terms of wear and tear. Miles driven increased 1% in November. Data for December and January isn't currently available. The other statistic we highlight is the number of 7-year and older vehicles on the road, which continues to trend in our industry's favor. For the trailing 4 quarters, total sales per AutoZone store were $1,753,000. This statistic continues to set the pace for the rest of the industry.\r\nFor the quarter, total commercial sales increased 14.5%. Commercial represented 17% of our total sales compared to 16% last year and grew $47 million over last year's second quarter. We opened 29 new programs during the quarter versus 49 programs opened in our second quarter last fiscal year. We now have our commercial program in 3,935 stores supported by 171 hub stores. Approximately 1,100 of our programs are 3 years old or younger.\r\nAs Bill has mentioned earlier, both our total commercial sales and sales per program accelerated from the previous quarter's results. While our average sales per program is below some peers in our industry, we feel we are on the right track to methodically close that gap. It's important to highlight that we accelerated our new program growth over the past few years. As approximately 30% of our programs are younger than 3 years old, these openings have impacted our average sales metric and cannibalized some of our older programs. However, our focus is on growing market share and improving our service levels by having more programs closer to our customers.\r\nLooking specifically at our mature programs, those at least 5 years old, they grew in the mid-single-digit range this past quarter. Additionally, we still have significant opportunities to open additional programs over the next several years. We feel good about the success we've had on profitably growing the Commercial business. \r\nIn summary, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. We believe the improvements we have made and upcoming additional improvements from our inventory availability initiatives enhance our prospects. And we believe the addition of IMC will provide us with more avenues to service our commercial customers very effectively. We believe we are well positioned to grow this business and capture increased market share.\r\nOur Mexico stores continued to perform well. We opened 5 new stores during the second quarter. We currently have 411 stores in Mexico. As the U.S. dollar strengthened this past quarter, we did have an FX conversion headwind. However, we still delivered a solid U.S. dollar-equivalent EBIT result and felt good about being able to handle the currency weakening in regard to the overall impact to the company's results. We expect to open a similar number of stores in Mexico this fiscal year that we opened last year. Our returns and profit growth continue to be in line with our expectations.\r\nRegarding Brazil. We are currently operating 5 stores. We expect to open a few more stores over the next several months and then refine our offerings and prove that our concept works for our customers and is financially viable. Once we refine our offerings and operations and evaluate the performance, we will provide you with an update on our long-term growth plans.\r\nRecapping this past quarter's performance for the company. In total, our sales were $2,144,000,000, an increase of 7.7%. Domestic same-store sales or sales for stores open more than 1 year were up 3.6% for the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 52.2% of sales, up 15 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins, partially offset by the impact from Interamerican Motor Corporation, which was acquired during September 2014.\r\nLooking forward, we continue to believe there remains opportunity for merchandise gross margin expansion within both the Retail and Commercial businesses. The pressure we will experience in the IMC business, along with the rollout of further stores on more frequent deliveries from our distribution centers, will continue to cause headwinds to our overall gross margin rate. However, our primary focus remains growing absolute gross profit dollars in our total auto parts segment.\r\nSG&A for the quarter was 35.4% of sales, 25 basis points higher than last year's second quarter. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was due to higher incentive compensation, impact from the IMC acquisition and self-insured employee medical costs. Partially offsetting these items was a favorable credit card litigation settlement of $5.4 million recognized during the quarter.\r\nWhile we have invested in several key initiatives that are customer service-related, like training and systems upgrades, we believe we are well-positioned to manage our cost structure in response to our sales environment.\r\nEBIT for the quarter was $361 million, up 7.1% over last year's second quarter. Our EBIT margin was down 10 basis points at 16.9%. Interest expense for the quarter was $34.5 million compared with $39.5 million in Q2 a year ago. Debt outstanding as of end of the quarter was $4.4 billion or approximately $125 million more than last year's balance of $4.3 billion.\r\nOur adjusted debt level metric finished the quarter at 2.5x EBITDAR. While at any given quarter, we may increase or decrease our leverage metric based on management's opinion regarding debt and equity market conditions, we remain committed to both our investment-grade rating and our capital allocation strategy, and share repurchases are an important element of that strategy.\r\nFor the quarter, our tax rate was approximately 35.2%, in line with last year's second quarter. We expect our annual rate to be closer to 36.5% on an ongoing basis, as the deviation in results this quarter, like last year, was primarily driven by the government tax credits reinstituted in December of 2014.\r\nNet income for the quarter was $212 million, up 9.8%. Our diluted share count of 32.5 million shares was down 5% from last year's second quarter. The combination of these factors drove earnings per share for the quarter to $6.51, up 15.6% over the prior year's second quarter.\r\nRelating to the cash flow statement for the second fiscal quarter. Our operating cash flow was $101 million. Net fixed assets were up 7.7% versus last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $93.8 million and reflected the additional expenditures required to open 44 new stores this quarter. Capital expenditures on existing stores, hub store remodels, work on development of new stores for upcoming quarters and information technology investments.\r\nWith the new stores open, we finished this past quarter with 5,042 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico; 411 stores in Mexico; 18 IMC branches; and 5 stores in Brazil for a total location count of 5,476.\r\nDepreciation totaled $59.9 million for the quarter versus last year's second quarter expense of $58 million. This is in line with recent quarter growth rates.\r\nWith our excess cash flow, we repurchased $26 million of AutoZone stock in the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had $544 million remaining under our share buyback authorization and our leverage metric was 2.5x. Again, I want to stress we manage to appropriate credit ratings, not any one metric. The metric we report is meant as a guide only, as each rating agency firm has its own criteria.\r\nWe continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive capital deployment strategy.\r\nAccounts payable as a percentage of gross inventory finished the quarter at 107.5%. The inclusion of IMC reduced the AP ratio by 170 basis points.\r\nNext, I'd like to update you on our inventory levels in total and on a per store basis. We reported an inventory balance of $3.5 billion, up 12% versus the Q2 ending balance last year. Increased inventory reflects the recent IMC acquisition, new store growth and additional investments and coverage. Inventory per store was up 7.1% at $631,000 per store, reflecting our continued investments in hard parts coverage and the IMC acquisition. The increase in inventory per store this quarter due to the IMC acquisition was $11,000 per store.\r\nFinally, as Bill previously mentioned, our continued disciplined capital management approach resulted in return on investment capital for the trailing 4 quarters of 31.2%. We have and will continue to make investments that we believe will generate returns that significantly exceed our cost of capital.\r\nNow I'll turn it back to Bill Rhodes.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nThank you, Bill. We are pleased this morning to report our 34th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, growing this quarter at a rate of 15.6%. Our company has continued to be successful over the long run. That success is attributable to our approach to leveraging our unique and powerful culture and focusing on the needs of our customers. At the end of the day, our customers have choices, and we must innovate to ensure they turn to us for their vehicle solution needs.\r\nAs we continue to invest in our businesses and monitor the results from our ongoing inventory initiatives, we are optimistic about our future. We feel like we continue to be on the right track. Again, we are excited about our initiatives around inventory assortment, supply chain solutions, hub stores, commercial growth, Mexico, ALLDATA, eCommerce, Brazil and now, IMC.\r\nOur long-term model is to grow new store square footage at a low single-digit growth rate, and we expect to continue growing our Commercial business at an accelerated rate. Therefore, we routinely look to grow our EBIT dollars in the mid-single digit range or better in times of strength, And we leverage our very strong and predictable cash flow to repurchase shares, enhancing our earnings per share growth in the double-digits.\r\nWe feel the track we are on will allow us to continue winning for the long run. We believe our steady, consistent strategy is correct. It is the attention to details and consistent execution that will matter. Our belief is solid, consistent strategy combined with superior execution is a formula for success.\r\nOur charge remains to optimize our performance regardless of market conditions and to continue to ensure we are investing in the key initiatives that will drive our long-term performance. In the end, delivering strong EPS growth and ROIC each and every quarter is how we measure ourselves. We are pleased with our results this past quarter, but we must remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives.\r\nNow we'd like to open up the call for questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "First question, for Bill Rhodes, concerns the delivery frequency program and increasing that. Could you maybe just provide a little bit more color, Bill, as to when you think -- if the program goes according to your plan, when peak spending to support the effort will occur? And maybe you can provide a little bit of color on the comp lift that you're seeing to the stores that are supported already by the increase in frequency?\n\n---\n\nThat's a terrific question, Alan, and one that I don't want to go in too in-depth at this point in time. And one of the reasons why is we've been testing this in 168 stores in 5 different markets, and they're 5 very different geographies with different competitive sets and the like. And our results generally have been good, but some parts of them are still hard to read. And that's why we decided to expand it by another over 300 stores. And I think as we get the read on those stores over the third quarter and fourth quarter, we will have a much better understanding to confirm that we're on the right track, hopefully, to confirm that they're actually performing better than the ones we've done today. It's just a little bit early. Our expectation is once we make a decision, we're going to come back to you all and we'll communicate it clearly and show you what we believe the financial implications are on the operating margin, gross margins and capital expenditures.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Is it reasonable to expect, Bill, that the frequency actually may vary depending on region where some stores may get deliveries 3 times a week and others will get deliveries as many as 5 times? Or are you going to do a unilateral approach across-the-board?\n\n---\n\nI think at this point in time, everything is still on the table. We are testing 3 times. We're testing 5 times. We've tested 2 times. And clearly, in some places, you're going to be very close to the store. So the cost of going 5 times is not as significant as if you're 500 miles away. So I think we still have to determine those things and that's why we expanded it to another 300-plus stores in the last month.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And one follow-up, if I may. I believe you said that ALLDATA was slowing. Could you maybe just provide a little bit more color as to what you are seeing there? and what initiatives over the next 12 months are you going to take to reaccelerate that business?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, ALLDATA continues to be the market leader in diagnostic repair software. And so what we have seen is a little bit more competition in the marketplace and a little bit more pricing pressure on the product. We continue to command a very large market share in that segment. And our strategy over the next 12 to 24 months is to continue to add enhancements to the product to service our customers better and add additional value. Some of that will be through repair information, confirmed repair information. We've put a community website up today that is part of the repair product, and that's been received very well. So there's a lot of enhancements that we're making to our suite of products that we think, over time, will continue to create a larger stickiness with our customers and add more value.\n\n---\n\nBill, would you comment -- your comment on dilution of the EBIT margin at IMC. Would you take a step further and if all these other initiatives on the rollout as far as multiple deliveries per week could, over time, offset some of that. Would that not be correct if you looked out to the completion of that project?\n\n---\n\nActually, if I may -- I'll jump in, John. I would say probably not. I would think of them differently. IMC operates at a lower-margin business than the overall AutoZone business does. We think we can improve IMC's operating margin. We think we can continue to grow that business. But it will continue to operate at a lower margin than our overall company and, therefore, will create a little bit of dilution on our operating margin. Now obviously, when we anniversary that acquisition that occurred in September of 2014, then it won't be a year-over-year headwind per se. \r\nRelative to delivery frequency, the play there is really to add some additional cost into our operating cost structure in an effort to increase sales, gain further market share and grow operating profit at a faster rate. And so both of those will create a little bit of headwind from a pure operating margin rate standpoint. But the objective, obviously, in both cases is to continue to provide better service and value to our customers, be closer to our customers with inventory and be able to capture market share and grow operating profit.\n\n---\n\nThis is actually Chris Bottiglieri on for Aram Rubinson. I had just a quick question on the commercial program growth. So you took the growth down this year, but obviously the sales are up nicely. So maybe you can just kind of walk us through your thought process there and desire to slow that down. Are your current inventory tests and field tests and delivery tests part of this? Is it you just maybe realize that you grew too fast over the last couple of years? Or is it just kind of preserving capital to use it elsewhere in your business?\n\n---\n\nYes, great question. I think I'll start with it was our plan this year as we came into the year to slow down a little bit. Remember, what, 7 years ago, we had 51% of the stores on the program. We now have 78% of the stores on the program. We don't have a vision that 100% of the stores will have the commercial program, but we do believe it will be significantly higher than it is today. We just don't know the exact number. The reason we slowed it down was, one, we're later in the life cycle of the program openings. But more importantly, we really wanted to focus the organization more on growing the mature programs and specifically growing our business with mature customers. As we've opened so many of these programs in the last 4, 5 years, taking a lot of time and attention away from the existing programs, it also cannibalized the existing programs. But this year, we really wanted to recalibrate our focus and focus intensely on growing mature programs and mature customers. And so far, through the first 6 months, that's having some nice benefits.\n\n---\n\nBill, you had noted that you were seeing the initial payback with your mature customers. Does that reflect the fact that they're seeing the benefit of the better in-stock position? And then second, what is the strategy for your outbound sales guys to become more aggressive in letting new accounts know about your greater commercial capabilities?\n\n---\n\nA couple of great questions. Thanks, Dan. On the sales force side, we really started building a sales force about 7, 8 years ago now. And I will tell you, I am just -- every time I ride with one of our salespeople, every time I talk to our senior sales leaders, I am just remarkably impressed by the progress that we've made. And unlike a lot of organizations where it's -- you put the salespeople out there to eat what you can kill, our sales processes are very well-defined. And our team determines exactly where we want our salespeople to be, the exact type of accounts and, by the way, the exact accounts that they want them to call on that week. So part of what we've done is we've redirected some of their focus and efforts to the existing stores or the existing customers that we have, and that's beginning to pay off, which we are still calling on new customers. But we really want to be focused on the ones that we have today. And I'm sorry, I forgot your first question.\n\n---\n\nWell, it's just -- I think you answered that, that the initial payback with the immature customers, that reflects the fact that you're able to say yes more often to their orders.\n\n---\n\nYes -- yes, no -- really, so far, we've only seen one of the initiatives that we embarked on, and that was the change in our algorithms that we made last year to put newer inventory closer to the customer. As we work on both this MegaHub approach and this delivery frequency approach, that can have a material difference in our ability to say yes. And it is more important with the -- it's important on both the Commercial and DIY side. But with the Commercial customer calling you multiple times a day versus a DIY customer calling you a few times a year, it's very, very important on the Commercial side.\n\n---\n\nAnd just 1 other question. After you complete opening 3 additional distribution centers, your total network is still about half the number of DC locations that your competitors have. Do you see this just as an intermediate investment and that someday AutoZone may operate 20-plus distribution centers?\n\n---\n\nI would say at this point in time, absolutely not. We see this as the permanent solution. That doesn't mean that we won't get smarter over time and decide we need to drop another DC in here. But we have no vision of a 25-distribution center model. Now that being said, 3 years ago, we didn't have a vision of going delivery frequency. And as our business has changed and as the competitive landscape has changed, we had to modify our model. But today, we think that is the right long-term approach.\n\n---\n\nThis is Josh on for Simeon. Just a question on gasoline prices. Are you seeing a noticeable pickup from lower prices? And then on the weather front, do you expect a pickup later on as a result of the colder weather right now?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's always difficult to really measure with any precision on that. Clearly, the lower gas prices, we believe, have been helpful, and they certainly have probably contributed at some level to our comp. I don't think significantly, but they certainly have been helpful. So we try to weigh in all the things between gas and tax refunds, et cetera. From a maintenance perspective, we think that as we -- obviously, this has been a longer winter and it's dragging on. But clearly, spring will be here hopefully in the next couple of weeks. And then we'll get back to our core maintenance categories and things like that, and we expect those businesses to perform well. So we'll have to get a little bit further down the road to look in the rearview mirror to see exactly what the impacts are of gas and weather, but we expect it to be favorable in the spring.\n\n---\n\nIt's Simeon, if I can just ask one follow-up. I don't know if anyone asked this, so I apologize if it's redundant. The loyalty card, can you talk about how helpful it's been to sales. Have you been tracking it in terms of sign-ups, in terms of wallet share, in terms of driving traffic?\n\n---\n\nYes, Simeon. As you know, I guess we launched the first part of the loyalty program 9 or 10 years ago, and then we took it to the digital program probably 7 years ago. This past year -- we used to have different programs in different parts of the country. This past year, we went to one consolidated nationwide program. And the program has worked very well since the beginning, it continues to work well. And it's growing, although it's growing at a lower rate just because it's more mature. Now there have been 2 of our competitors that have launched loyalty programs in the last year. So -- but both are different than ours. So far, we continue to be very happy with our loyalty program, and we continue to grow. We haven't seen material changes in our loyalty acceptance rate versus where we were before.\n\n---\n\nCan we take a step back just think a little bit more about the long-term financial model? You continue to expect mid-single-digit EBIT growth or better, but it seems like you're investing a little bit more capital in DCs and whatnot and some of these acquisitions. So longer-term, should we expect ROIC to continue to decline? Or is it going to be stable? How do you think about that?\n\n---\n\nYes, the way we really think about it is that -- and as Bill, I think, highlighted in his remarks, we're very proud of the ROIC number that we have and we recognize that it's probably one of the highest in hardline retail. At the same time, we're very focused on investing in initiatives that we believe will generate very strong returns and, more importantly, will capture market share and grow earnings. So I think as we look at the model on a longer-term basis that we'll focus on those kinds of initiatives, and they may or may not have some pressure on ROIC and bring it down a little bit. But again, we're focused on growing operating profit dollars, capturing market share and investing in activities that generate very strong returns.\n\n---\n\nCould I add to that, too? I mean, if we held ourselves to a standard where we wouldn't make investments unless they were at 32% return on invested capital, we wouldn't do a lot of things that would be very important to our business and would, frankly, put ourselves at a competitive disadvantage. That's why we've held this longtime internal hurdle rate, and it's worked very well. Remember, when we implemented the internal hurdle rate, our ROIC was around 20%. So we've been able to grow it over time by being very disciplined but at the same time, we can't hold single initiatives to a 30-plus percent return.\n\n---\n\nThat makes perfect sense. If you look at the portfolio of initiatives you have right now, how do you think about them in rank order in terms of the ROIC potential, whether it be IMC, whether it be delivery frequency, MegaHubs, inventory additions, et cetera?\n\n---\n\nI would say the first and foremost biggest short- to medium-term opportunity is just growing the Commercial business. It's a very low capital required to grow that business. So anything that we can do, enhance our sales force, continue to improve our execution, that is by far and away the single biggest way to drive ROIC. I think most of the other initiatives, based upon our modeling today, would be slightly dilutive to return on invested capital. But they have very good returns, and they're going to accelerate the growth of operating profit dollars, which is one of our objectives.\n\n---\n\nIt's actually Mark Becks on for Chris. I just want to sharpen the pencil on the trend. You mentioned your core business was up 200 basis points on a 2-year rolling basis. Outside of the 50-basis-point contribution from tax refunds, is it safe to say the remainder is what you view as sustainable? I guess, I'm just trying to get a sense of how you view the underlying growth rate of the industry versus potential share gains in the moving pieces with gas and weather?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think that -- well, first of all, I think to some extent gas is probably a more longer-term one. I mean, obviously, we're going to get some increases in gas prices. But on a relative basis, they will be well below last year and I suspect that they will continue to be so for at least the immediate future. Relative to tax refunds, you're right, as we called out, we think that maybe that was 100 basis points of impact on Q2. We'll have a better feel for that as we move our way through Q3. And then, excluding that, I think that the way we look at it is just that, that really is the underlying core trends of the business.\n\n---\n\nOkay. If I look at DIY historically, it's been kind of a 1%, 2% growth business. And obviously, that's with the benefit of inflation, which you're not seeing right now. Is there anything structurally changing with the industry? Or maybe your thoughts on just the outlook for the Retail business in general?\n\n---\n\nI don't think that we see -- anything necessarily structurally changing in the business. If you look at the competitive landscape from a pricing promotional activity, even from a capital investment perspective, it continues to be a pretty consistent and rational industry overall. And you are right, we have not been the beneficiary of inflation over the last -- almost at this point I'd say 18-plus months, maybe pushing 24 months, and it doesn't appear as  though there's a lot of inflation in the horizon either. There's a couple of categories here and there that have some inflation but, for the most part, we've been generating these sales out of a no-inflation kind of environment. So it really is the strength of the customer, the strength of our offering that was really driving that.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then a follow-up to Alan's question on the expanded daily delivery frequency. You're at 10% of your stores now. If you were to flip the switch and roll it out to a greater number, is there anything in terms of a particular stress that you'd be able to do to add to a greater number of stores? Or how would you think about the timing of that growth?\n\n---\n\nI think it's still yet to be determined. We just went over and implemented 300 stores. Obviously, that's the biggest thing that we've done at this point in time. We did it over about 3 weeks. And so far, it's gone pretty well. But there has to be a tremendous amount of efforts in the distribution centers to ramp up for that increase of activity, both inside the warehouse and in the transportation team. So we'll learn from this newest rollout and we'll plan for future ones. But more importantly, now we've got about 500 stores on the program and we are hopeful that we can quickly confirm our expectations today.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And one quick follow-up to that, given the potential for an increased CapEx, should you continue to roll this out, do you think that would meaningfully alter your philosophy on share buybacks going forward?\n\n---\n\nIt won't alter our philosophy at all. I mean, we believe that it is a great way to add value back to the shareholders and return capital back to the shareholders through the share repurchase program. We've been very disciplined about it. We operate at a very defined credit metric, and we'll continue to do so.\n\n---\n\nI had 2 questions. First was how many stores now have the extended IMC inventory? So I think it was 300 with the added inventory, but how many of those -- or is it a different group that have the IMC?\n\n---\n\nA different group. It's under 10.\n\n---\n\nSo it's just a handful?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, we've been doing this for 6 or 7 weeks so far, Greg, and we did a lot of work around the systems piece. But even now, at this point in time, we're muscling it. We're just trying to get a sense for it. So far, we've been really encouraged.\n\n---\n\nVery early days, okay. So then switching to CapEx and cash a little bit. If my math is right, you'll be opening -- or doing 100 commercial programs each of the next 2 quarters.\n\n---\n\nThat's about right, yes.\n\n---\n\nYes, roughly.\n\n---\n\nAnd then given everything that you talked about, what sort of CapEx run rate, should we look at the last 6 months as sort of a normal thing now to get all the initiatives done that you've talked about?\n\n---\n\nI would say probably about that. I mean, we're certainly going to be right around about a $500 million number, so I think -- on an annualized basis, so it'll be a little bit of a step-up but not significantly.\n\n---\n\nAnd on the AP to inventory ratio, it seems like that came down. Was there any sort of timing issues there? Or again, just given everything you're doing on inventory, that could be -- we might see that effect kind of stick around for a little bit.\n\n---\n\nI think the latter. I think that, hopefully, we were somewhat consistent 2 or 3 quarters ago when we began to add more inventory and we tried to call out, that'll put a little bit of AP -- pressure on AP to inventory when you fast-forward 3 or 4 quarters, and here we are. So it was certainly down this quarter. We don't anticipate it going down further necessarily for the next 2 quarters, but we expect it to hang around that kind of number.\n\n---\n\nThis is Chandni Luthra on behalf of Matt Fassler. I just have 2 quick ones. Could you give us the contribution of IMC to your SG&A?\n\n---\n\nI think we said that it was probably around 15 basis points, I would say. All 3 of those categories that we identified accounted for about 45 basis points, and they're all relatively equal [ph].\n\n---\n\nOkay, got it. And then just to get some clarity on the recent cold weather particularly Northeast region, did it help? And I mean, what we're trying to basically gauge is would the Northeast results have been any worse without the cold snap.\n\n---\n\nAre you talking about the most recent cold snap? They weren't...\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, basically the last month or so.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So about half of that was in our results. But remember the cold snaps, as you get later in the winter, the cold snaps are more of a headwind than they are a benefit. Early in the season, it spurs activity of people trying to get their vehicles ready for the winter. Once it happens late in the winter, most of the parts that are going to fail have already failed and, frankly, customers have winter fatigue and they're not doing things getting ready for the winter. So they're generally not beneficial later in the year -- or later in the season as they are early.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate that we have a long and strong heritage of consistent impressive performance. While we are excited about our growth prospects for the year, we will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have choices. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year. But I want to stress, this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value. We are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful.\r\nThank you for participating in today's call.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Alan Rifkin (Analysts)】\nFirst question, for Bill Rhodes, concerns the delivery frequency program and increasing that. Could you maybe just provide a little bit more color, Bill, as to when you think -- if the program goes according to your plan, when peak spending to support the effort will occur? And maybe you can provide a little bit of color on the comp lift that you're seeing to the stores that are supported already by the increase in frequency?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nThat's a terrific question, Alan, and one that I don't want to go in too in-depth at this point in time. And one of the reasons why is we've been testing this in 168 stores in 5 different markets, and they're 5 very different geographies with different competitive sets and the like. And our results generally have been good, but some parts of them are still hard to read. And that's why we decided to expand it by another over 300 stores. And I think as we get the read on those stores over the third quarter and fourth quarter, we will have a much better understanding to confirm that we're on the right track, hopefully, to confirm that they're actually performing better than the ones we've done today. It's just a little bit early. Our expectation is once we make a decision, we're going to come back to you all and we'll communicate it clearly and show you what we believe the financial implications are on the operating margin, gross margins and capital expenditures.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alan Rifkin (Analysts)】\nOkay. Is it reasonable to expect, Bill, that the frequency actually may vary depending on region where some stores may get deliveries 3 times a week and others will get deliveries as many as 5 times? Or are you going to do a unilateral approach across-the-board?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nI think at this point in time, everything is still on the table. We are testing 3 times. We're testing 5 times. We've tested 2 times. And clearly, in some places, you're going to be very close to the store. So the cost of going 5 times is not as significant as if you're 500 miles away. So I think we still have to determine those things and that's why we expanded it to another 300-plus stores in the last month.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alan Rifkin (Analysts)】\nOkay. And one follow-up, if I may. I believe you said that ALLDATA was slowing. Could you maybe just provide a little bit more color as to what you are seeing there? and what initiatives over the next 12 months are you going to take to reaccelerate that business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, ALLDATA continues to be the market leader in diagnostic repair software. And so what we have seen is a little bit more competition in the marketplace and a little bit more pricing pressure on the product. We continue to command a very large market share in that segment. And our strategy over the next 12 to 24 months is to continue to add enhancements to the product to service our customers better and add additional value. Some of that will be through repair information, confirmed repair information. We've put a community website up today that is part of the repair product, and that's been received very well. So there's a lot of enhancements that we're making to our suite of products that we think, over time, will continue to create a larger stickiness with our customers and add more value.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Lawrence (Analysts)】\nBill, would you comment -- your comment on dilution of the EBIT margin at IMC. Would you take a step further and if all these other initiatives on the rollout as far as multiple deliveries per week could, over time, offset some of that. Would that not be correct if you looked out to the completion of that project?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nActually, if I may -- I'll jump in, John. I would say probably not. I would think of them differently. IMC operates at a lower-margin business than the overall AutoZone business does. We think we can improve IMC's operating margin. We think we can continue to grow that business. But it will continue to operate at a lower margin than our overall company and, therefore, will create a little bit of dilution on our operating margin. Now obviously, when we anniversary that acquisition that occurred in September of 2014, then it won't be a year-over-year headwind per se. \r\nRelative to delivery frequency, the play there is really to add some additional cost into our operating cost structure in an effort to increase sales, gain further market share and grow operating profit at a faster rate. And so both of those will create a little bit of headwind from a pure operating margin rate standpoint. But the objective, obviously, in both cases is to continue to provide better service and value to our customers, be closer to our customers with inventory and be able to capture market share and grow operating profit.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Bottiglieri (Analysts)】\nThis is actually Chris Bottiglieri on for Aram Rubinson. I had just a quick question on the commercial program growth. So you took the growth down this year, but obviously the sales are up nicely. So maybe you can just kind of walk us through your thought process there and desire to slow that down. Are your current inventory tests and field tests and delivery tests part of this? Is it you just maybe realize that you grew too fast over the last couple of years? Or is it just kind of preserving capital to use it elsewhere in your business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes, great question. I think I'll start with it was our plan this year as we came into the year to slow down a little bit. Remember, what, 7 years ago, we had 51% of the stores on the program. We now have 78% of the stores on the program. We don't have a vision that 100% of the stores will have the commercial program, but we do believe it will be significantly higher than it is today. We just don't know the exact number. The reason we slowed it down was, one, we're later in the life cycle of the program openings. But more importantly, we really wanted to focus the organization more on growing the mature programs and specifically growing our business with mature customers. As we've opened so many of these programs in the last 4, 5 years, taking a lot of time and attention away from the existing programs, it also cannibalized the existing programs. But this year, we really wanted to recalibrate our focus and focus intensely on growing mature programs and mature customers. And so far, through the first 6 months, that's having some nice benefits.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nBill, you had noted that you were seeing the initial payback with your mature customers. Does that reflect the fact that they're seeing the benefit of the better in-stock position? And then second, what is the strategy for your outbound sales guys to become more aggressive in letting new accounts know about your greater commercial capabilities?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nA couple of great questions. Thanks, Dan. On the sales force side, we really started building a sales force about 7, 8 years ago now. And I will tell you, I am just -- every time I ride with one of our salespeople, every time I talk to our senior sales leaders, I am just remarkably impressed by the progress that we've made. And unlike a lot of organizations where it's -- you put the salespeople out there to eat what you can kill, our sales processes are very well-defined. And our team determines exactly where we want our salespeople to be, the exact type of accounts and, by the way, the exact accounts that they want them to call on that week. So part of what we've done is we've redirected some of their focus and efforts to the existing stores or the existing customers that we have, and that's beginning to pay off, which we are still calling on new customers. But we really want to be focused on the ones that we have today. And I'm sorry, I forgot your first question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nWell, it's just -- I think you answered that, that the initial payback with the immature customers, that reflects the fact that you're able to say yes more often to their orders.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes -- yes, no -- really, so far, we've only seen one of the initiatives that we embarked on, and that was the change in our algorithms that we made last year to put newer inventory closer to the customer. As we work on both this MegaHub approach and this delivery frequency approach, that can have a material difference in our ability to say yes. And it is more important with the -- it's important on both the Commercial and DIY side. But with the Commercial customer calling you multiple times a day versus a DIY customer calling you a few times a year, it's very, very important on the Commercial side.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nAnd just 1 other question. After you complete opening 3 additional distribution centers, your total network is still about half the number of DC locations that your competitors have. Do you see this just as an intermediate investment and that someday AutoZone may operate 20-plus distribution centers?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nI would say at this point in time, absolutely not. We see this as the permanent solution. That doesn't mean that we won't get smarter over time and decide we need to drop another DC in here. But we have no vision of a 25-distribution center model. Now that being said, 3 years ago, we didn't have a vision of going delivery frequency. And as our business has changed and as the competitive landscape has changed, we had to modify our model. But today, we think that is the right long-term approach.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joshua Siber (Analysts)】\nThis is Josh on for Simeon. Just a question on gasoline prices. Are you seeing a noticeable pickup from lower prices?

Obviously, that's the biggest thing that we've done at this point in time. We did it over about 3 weeks. And so far, it's gone pretty well. But there has to be a tremendous amount of efforts in the distribution centers to ramp up for that increase of activity, both inside the warehouse and in the transportation team. So we'll learn from this newest rollout and we'll plan for future ones. But more importantly, now we've got about 500 stores on the program and we are hopeful that we can quickly confirm our expectations today.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Becks (Analysts)】\nOkay. And one quick follow-up to that, given the potential for an increased CapEx, should you continue to roll this out, do you think that would meaningfully alter your philosophy on share buybacks going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nIt won't alter our philosophy at all. I mean, we believe that it is a great way to add value back to the shareholders and return capital back to the shareholders through the share repurchase program. We've been very disciplined about it. We operate at a very defined credit metric, and we'll continue to do so.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nI had 2 questions. First was how many stores now have the extended IMC inventory? So I think it was 300 with the added inventory, but how many of those -- or is it a different group that have the IMC?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nA different group. It's under 10.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nSo it's just a handful?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, we've been doing this for 6 or 7 weeks so far, Greg, and we did a lot of work around the systems piece. But even now, at this point in time, we're muscling it. We're just trying to get a sense for it. So far, we've been really encouraged.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nVery early days, okay. So then switching to CapEx and cash a little bit. If my math is right, you'll be opening -- or doing 100 commercial programs each of the next 2 quarters.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nThat's about right, yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nYes, roughly.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nAnd then given everything that you talked about, what sort of CapEx run rate, should we look at the last 6 months as sort of a normal thing now to get all the initiatives done that you've talked about?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nI would say probably about that. I mean, we're certainly going to be right around about a $500 million number, so I think -- on an annualized basis, so it'll be a little bit of a step-up but not significantly.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nAnd on the AP to inventory ratio, it seems like that came down. Was there any sort of timing issues there? Or again, just given everything you're doing on inventory, that could be -- we might see that effect kind of stick around for a little bit.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nI think the latter. I think that, hopefully, we were somewhat consistent 2 or 3 quarters ago when we began to add more inventory and we tried to call out, that'll put a little bit of AP -- pressure on AP to inventory when you fast-forward 3 or 4 quarters, and here we are. So it was certainly down this quarter. We don't anticipate it going down further necessarily for the next 2 quarters, but we expect it to hang around that kind of number.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chandni Luthra (Analysts)】\nThis is Chandni Luthra on behalf of Matt Fassler. I just have 2 quick ones. Could you give us the contribution of IMC to your SG&A?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Giles (Executives)】\nI think we said that it was probably around 15 basis points, I would say. All 3 of those categories that we identified accounted for about 45 basis points, and they're all relatively equal [ph].\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chandni Luthra (Analysts)】\nOkay, got it. And then just to get some clarity on the recent cold weather particularly Northeast region, did it help? And I mean, what we're trying to basically gauge is would the Northeast results have been any worse without the cold snap.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nAre you talking about the most recent cold snap? They weren't...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chandni Luthra (Analysts)】\nYes. I mean, basically the last month or so.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nOkay. So about half of that was in our results. But remember the cold snaps, as you get later in the winter, the cold snaps are more of a headwind than they are a benefit. Early in the season, it spurs activity of people trying to get their vehicles ready for the winter. Once it happens late in the winter, most of the parts that are going to fail have already failed and, frankly, customers have winter fatigue and they're not doing things getting ready for the winter. So they're generally not beneficial later in the year -- or later in the season as they are early.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Rhodes (Executives)】\nGreat. Before we conclude the call, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate that we have a long and strong heritage of consistent impressive performance. While we are excited about our growth prospects for the year, we will not take anything for granted as we understand our customers have choices. We have a solid plan to succeed this fiscal year. But I want to stress, this is a marathon and not a sprint. As we continue to focus on the basics and focus on optimizing long-term shareholder value. We are confident AutoZone will continue to be very successful.\r\nThank you for participating in today's call.",

Joining me on the call today are Bill Cobb, our President and CEO; and Greg Macfarlane, our CFO. Jason Houseworth, the President of Global Digital and Product Management; and Mark Ciaramitaro, Vice President of Health Care, will be available during the Q&A session.\r\nIn connection with this call, we have posted today's press release on the Investor Relations website at hrblock.com. Some of the figures that we'll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures in the schedules attached to our press release.\r\nBefore we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws. Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance.\r\nForward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially. You can learn more about these risks in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2014 and our other SEC filings. H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements.\r\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Colby, and good afternoon, everyone. Earlier today, we announced our results for the fiscal 2015 third quarter, which ended January 31. The IRS opened e-file earlier this January than it did last year, which allowed us to recognize additional revenue in the third quarter compared to last year's quarter. Of course, because of the seasonality of our business, our third quarter results are not indicative of our expected full year performance. Greg will provide more details on our fiscal third quarter later during this call.\r\nAs has become the norm in our industry, the tax season is off to an interesting start. We entered this season with the Affordable Care Act featured prominently in the news. This soon gave way to market disruptions in the DIY category due to pricing actions taken by a competitor. Finally, industry-wide DIY tax fraud, which we have been discussing for some time, became a key focus this season with our top competitor in the DIY space saying they're seeing as much as a 3,700% increase in DIY fraud related to tax refunds in some states.\r\nI'd like to spend the next several minutes talking about what we've seen in the industry this year, specifically focusing on the Affordable Care Act and fraud, and then I'll provide some thoughts on our performance.\r\nLet's start with the ACA, which represents the largest change to the U.S. tax code in decades. Our clients are feeling the impact and they have a lot of questions, and at times are confused. Many have been required to complete additional forms or worksheets. As we released on February 24, our analysis shows that 52% of those that obtained health insurance via the state or federal marketplaces underestimated their annual income and are having their refunds reduced by an average of 17% or $530. Conversely, roughly 1/3 overestimated their income and are having their refunds increased by $365 on average. Overall, the average impact has been a refund reduction of 8% or $141.\r\nOur analysis further shows that the penalty for uninsured filers is averaging $172 or almost double the $95 penalty many taxpayers anticipated. Consumer behavior will likely shift in future years, as the penalties for noncompliance continue to climb, motivating more people to purchase insurance through exchanges. Early data from the Department of Health and Human Services indicates that over 11 million people signed up for healthcare insurance through the exchanges this year, an increase from 7 million enrollees the year before. This is an area in which we have a great opportunity to assist our clients with their needs, and we believe this opportunity will continue to grow over the next several years.\r\nSpecific to this tax season, the proportion of our clients, who have been directly impacted by the ACA, has thus far been lower than our expectations. We entered this year expecting the ACA to impact the first half of the season at a greater rate, but we are now seeing results that suggest ACA-impacted clients will be more evenly distributed throughout the season and possibly more heavily weighted toward the second half. This is in part due to the delays in forms, mailings by the federal and state exchanges, which is likely pushing filings from the early part of the season to the later part. In fact, the HHS announced in late February that 90% to 95% of marketplace participants, who had received incorrect 1095-A forms, had yet to file their taxes.\r\nI'd like to provide one final thought related to the ACA. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the tireless efforts of our associates and tax pros who are providing best-in-class service to our clients impacted by these changes. We've invested over 600,000 hours of ACA-related training for our tax professionals, and it's showing in the quality of service we're providing. Based on our channel checks, we are distinguishing ourselves as the ACA experts in the tax preparation industry. And while there's still a lot of season left, we're pleased with our efforts to date, and we will continue to help our clients navigate the tax complexity introduced by this law.\r\nI'd now like to take some time to talk about an issue that has finally received a lot of attention this season, tax fraud. As I noted in my open letter published in the New York Times on February 17, fraud in our industry continues to be a significant and growing concern, to which no taxpayer is immune. Government agencies put the total annual tax identity theft losses at greater than $5 billion, with nearly 2 million suspected identity theft incidents in 2013. That's up from just 440,000 incidents in 2010, which represents an increase of over 350% or 1.5 million in just 3 years. And what was once an issue focused at the federal level has now extended into the state level, as evidenced by our largest competitor having to shut down their state e-filings during the height of the DIY tax season to evaluate state-level fraud exposure. \r\nAnother problem cited by the Treasury Department is improper Earned Income Tax Credit payments, which total $16 billion to $19 billion annually, up from estimates of $13 billion to $15 billion. Inconsistent EITC return standards have moved the issue out of the assisted tax base and into the DIY channel, contributing to a material change in EITC taxpayer behaviors, which I will discuss later.\r\nFraud is not a new issue for the industry, and H&R Block has been at the forefront of the battle against fraud for years. We have collaborated with the EITC software development workgroup at the IRS since early 2013 to develop fraud screening parity between assisted and digital tax prep. Last year, we brought together tax policy and consumer advocate thought leaders at a forum in Washington, D.C. to discuss this very problem, and to announce the findings of our survey regarding consumer awareness and attitudes toward tax fraud. I have testified before the Senate Finance Committee and met with numerous members of both the house and senate regarding EITC and the need for professional standards for tax preparers. \r\nOur efforts are producing results. Late last year, on December 16, Congress directed the Treasury Department to implement consistent requirements across all tax-preparation methods for taxpayers applying for credits such as the EITC. Now treasury needs to implement the requirements in time for tax season 2016, which I'll address shortly. I have issued a call to action for the IRS and my colleagues within the tax-preparation industry to come together to create solutions to these problems. Recently, IRS Commissioner, Koskinen, announced that he will convene a meeting to facilitate this discussion. There are both long and short-term solutions to consider, but 2 immediate actions should be taken to minimize the potential for fraud. First, there must be minimum federal competency standards for all tax preparers. As you've heard me say before, all 50 states impose licensing requirements for cutting hair, but currently, there are no federal standards on competency applicable to all pay tax preparers, and only 4 states have such standards. This isn't about simply creating another category of professionals, it's about empowering and protecting the 60% of consumers who get help with their taxes every year. \r\nSecond, we need to address the $16 billion to $19 billion of annual improper payments related to the Earned Income Tax Credit. Having different standards for different methods of tax return preparation is encouraging fraudulent behavior in the DIY channel. Since 2008, when the inconsistent standards came into play, there has been a 14-point increase in the proportion of EITC filers using do-it-yourself preparation methods from 28% then to 42% in 2014. During this same period, the broader market filing patterns did not change materially. Considering that 20% of all tax returns include the EITC, a shift of this magnitude has a significant impact on improper payments and the overall industry. This move from assisted to DIY allows the taxpayer to avoid having to answer up to 27 additional questions on a separate tax form to determine EITC eligibility. Additionally, assisted tax preparers are now personally liable for properly completing the additional EITC form. This has resulted in fraudulent tax preparers acting as ghostwriters by completing taxes for their clients on a DIY platform without the preparer signing the return. As I mentioned earlier, on December 16, Congress directed the Treasury Department to implement consistent standards for these credits by saying the following: \"In an effort to reduce intentional fraud and filing errors in refundable credit programs intended to help taxpayers, the Department of the Treasury is directed to ensure that the same questions are being asked of taxpayers, whether they are preparing their returns with a paid tax preparer or via do-it-yourself methods such as paper forms, preparation software or online preparation tools. Implementing uniform questions for refundable credit filers is a commonsense step that will help alleviate confusion over eligibility and better establish qualifications for these credits.\"\r\nThat sounds pretty clear to me. We agree with Congress, but this is common sense. In contrast, the largest competitor in the DIY space has said that consistent standards present taxpayers with a \"compliance burden.\" It is both ridiculous and self-serving to suggest that requiring consistent fraud screens to fix a $16 billion to $19 billion problem is too great of a burden to bear. It is also ridiculous that one group of taxpayers should have to answer a series of up to 27 questions to obtain the credit while another group is not held to the same standard. This is crucial to protect the people eligible for the credit and to prevent fraudsters from abusing the system at the expense of those that need it most. As these consistent standards have yet to be implemented by the Treasury Department, we will continue to advocate for such standards, and for Treasury to develop and implement a plan in time for tax season 2016. As I said earlier, we've been leading the fight against tax fraud for some time, and it's clear that taxpayers are ready for change as 93% of those surveyed by H&R Block are willing to do more to help combat fraud. Additionally, as long as tax fraud is allowed to persist, it will be difficult to get a true read on the overall industry and as such, its impact on our results. \r\nH&R Block will continue to lead the charge against tax return fraud, and I urge my fellow industry leaders to join me in this fight. Our message has been and is clear, as an industry, we need to do the right thing.\r\nGiven that overview, industry overview, I'd now like to talk about our early season results. To be clear, I am disappointed in our first half assisted volume. While we do not anticipate fully making up this loss of assisted returns and share in the second half of the season, we have reason to look forward to a stronger second half. Filing patterns within our client base as well as changes within the industry suggest we are seeing a shift in the timing of our business. Consistent with the past 2 years, our assisted filers are moving out of the traditional first peak and shifting toward a more delayed filing schedule. Part of this is likely due to the speed of refund processing by the IRS and state governments. While it used to take months to receive your refund after filing your taxes, you may now receive your money in as little as 8 days. Additionally, part of this is likely due to delays related to the ACA that I mentioned earlier. \r\nDespite this shift, we continue to experience success in our Tax Plus strategy to drive revenues through improved monetization and product attached. By focusing on the optimal return mix with strong product attach rates, we are seeing positive financial results despite a significant decline in assisted unit counts to date. Unit count is not the sole determinant of success in this industry. We have learned over the years that giving away our product to drive client count without regard for profitability doesn't work. There is a significant portion of taxpayers who are solely motivated by cost, and thus, are not loyal. This means that monetizing these clients in the long run often doesn't happen no matter which channel, assisted or DIY, they use to prepare their taxes. \r\nIn addition to the timing shift, the lower assisted volume stems from our decision to discontinue unprofitable promotions in prior years and the migration to DIY as a result of fraud. Consistent with last year, assisted return declines have been greater in lower value returns, as we continue to focus our efforts on those returns that contribute most significantly to the bottom line.\r\nOur 50% off promotion is targeting just those types of returns, as it is designed to attract more complex, higher value returns at a time when our offices historically have had available capacity.\r\nOn the digital side, I'm very pleased with all aspects of our business, our product performance, the client experience, our pricing, our marketing campaigns and our results. Revenues are up, and we have increased unit sales from the prior year in both our desktop and online products. Our multiyear effort to enhance our product and improve the client experience is yielding positive results, providing our clients with a fully responsive personalized experience is driving an improvement in client satisfaction, which ultimately translates to the top line. \r\nOnline e-files are up 7.2% and desktop is up 5%, as we are benefiting from competitors' pricing decisions and from well-targeted promotions. Overall, unit growth for digital is up 6.7% from last year. And even more importantly, our mix of paid versus free returns has dramatically improved. \r\nOur Tax Plus products continue to provide tremendous value to our clients. Our newest product, Tax Identity Shield, is an innovative product that offers our clients tax identity theft protection and support. Given the significant increase in tax identity theft, it is a timely offering that provides our customers the added comfort of knowing that they have protection and support, and is an example of H&R Block's innovation and knowledge of the tax industry. And for the second consecutive year, our Emerald Card has been rated as one of the top 3 prepaid debit cards in the market by a leading consumer advocacy publication.\r\nTo summarize, we've invested more than anyone in this industry in the ACA, we continue to lead the charge in the fight against tax fraud, and I believe our value proposition is the best in the industry. Considering all the factors I've discussed today, we won't have a full understanding of the tax season until after April 15. This season so far has been challenging, but we have reason to look forward to a stronger second half. We intend to stay fully focused on serving our clients, however they want to be served, whether by coming to our offices to get assistance from our experienced tax professionals or through our best-in-class digital offerings.\r\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Greg to discuss the fiscal third quarter financial results.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everybody. As a reminder, given the seasonality of our business, and the fact that the significant majority of our revenue and all of our earnings come in the fourth quarter, our third quarter results generally are not indicative of the results we expect to achieve for the full year. As Bill mentioned, the IRS opened e-file earlier this year than in 2014. Because we recognize tax-preparation fees when completed returns are filed with the IRS, we recognize an additional 11 days in revenue in the third quarter fiscal 2015.\r\nOverall, revenues for the quarter were $509 million, representing an increase of $309 million compared to the prior-year quarter. Net loss from continuing operations was $35 million or $0.13 per share compared to a net loss of $213 million or $0.78 per share in the prior year. For the full fiscal year, we continue to target adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 30%.\r\nWe continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with excellent liquidity. Cash and customer banking deposit balances were significantly higher at the end of the third quarter this year due to the earlier funding of refunds by the IRS. The total unrestricted cash balance was $1.3 billion, and total outstanding debt was $1.1 billion, which includes $591 million in commercial paper borrowings. And as a reminder, we repaid a $400 million note in October 2014, leaving us with $500 million in senior notes as of January 31.\r\nFinally, we expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 to be at the lower end of the range provided at our Investor Day in December of 35.5% to 36.5%.\r\nTurning to our segment results. Tax Services revenues increased $309 million to $503 million as a result of the earlier e-filing opening date. Consistent with expectations, total operating expenses increased $62 million to $571 million. The increase is due to variable costs associated with tax return preparation, expenses related to acquire franchise operations, increased training costs related to both the ACA and our new tax-preparation software and increased marketing. Additionally, depreciation, amortization increased as a result of the franchise buybacks we discussed at our Investor Conference on December 9. As a reminder, we stated that we were looking to reacquire a portion of the 650 offices sold to franchisees several years ago. This fiscal year, we repurchased 341 of those locations for approximately $100 million. In addition, we have spent approximately $12 million on other acquisitions, primarily of independent tax preparers. Going forward, we will continue to evaluate potential franchise buybacks and independent targets. However, we do not expect the overall mix of company run versus franchise locations to change materially. We continue to expect depreciation and amortization expenses of $160 million to $170 million for the fiscal year 2015. Included in this is amortization expense related to these acquisitions of $14 million, with an annualized rate of $19 million for the fiscal year 2016.\r\nIn our corporate segment, our pretax loss decreased $10 million to $15 million mainly due to decreased interest expense as a result of the repayment of the $400 million note in October of 2014. Reduced legal and consulting fees also contributed to a reduction in expenses.\r\nTurning to discontinued operations. The net loss from discontinued operations was $2 million. During the third quarter, Sand Canyon entered into a settlement agreement with a counterparty related to its representation in warranty obligations. The settlement amount was fully covered by prior accruals and was paid in the fiscal third quarter. Sand Canyon's accrual for contingent losses relating to representation of warranty claims totaled $144 million as of January 31. Sand Canyon continues to engage in constructive settlement discussions with the counterparties, from which it has received a significant majority of its asserted claims. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is, and always has been, operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate veil-cursing arguments.\r\nLastly, turning to H&R Block Bank. We continue to work with BofI and our regulators and believe that on its merits, this transaction should be approved. We will continue to provide updates as we make progress. We've covered a lot in today's call, so we'll now turn it over to your questions. Operator?",

This is an area in which we have a great opportunity to assist our clients with their needs, and we believe this opportunity will continue to grow over the next several years.\r\nSpecific to this tax season, the proportion of our clients, who have been directly impacted by the ACA, has thus far been lower than our expectations. We entered this year expecting the ACA to impact the first half of the season at a greater rate, but we are now seeing results that suggest ACA-impacted clients will be more evenly distributed throughout the season and possibly more heavily weighted toward the second half. This is in part due to the delays in forms, mailings by the federal and state exchanges, which is likely pushing filings from the early part of the season to the later part. In fact, the HHS announced in late February that 90% to 95% of marketplace participants, who had received incorrect 1095-A forms, had yet to file their taxes.\r\nI'd like to provide one final thought related to the ACA. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the tireless efforts of our associates and tax pros who are providing best-in-class service to our clients impacted by these changes. We've invested over 600,000 hours of ACA-related training for our tax professionals, and it's showing in the quality of service we're providing. Based on our channel checks, we are distinguishing ourselves as the ACA experts in the tax preparation industry. And while there's still a lot of season left, we're pleased with our efforts to date, and we will continue to help our clients navigate the tax complexity introduced by this law.\r\nI'd now like to take some time to talk about an issue that has finally received a lot of attention this season, tax fraud. As I noted in my open letter published in the New York Times on February 17, fraud in our industry continues to be a significant and growing concern, to which no taxpayer is immune. Government agencies put the total annual tax identity theft losses at greater than $5 billion, with nearly 2 million suspected identity theft incidents in 2013. That's up from just 440,000 incidents in 2010, which represents an increase of over 350% or 1.5 million in just 3 years. And what was once an issue focused at the federal level has now extended into the state level, as evidenced by our largest competitor having to shut down their state e-filings during the height of the DIY tax season to evaluate state-level fraud exposure. \r\nAnother problem cited by the Treasury Department is improper Earned Income Tax Credit payments, which total $16 billion to $19 billion annually, up from estimates of $13 billion to $15 billion. Inconsistent EITC return standards have moved the issue out of the assisted tax base and into the DIY channel, contributing to a material change in EITC taxpayer behaviors, which I will discuss later.\r\nFraud is not a new issue for the industry, and H&R Block has been at the forefront of the battle against fraud for years. We have collaborated with the EITC software development workgroup at the IRS since early 2013 to develop fraud screening parity between assisted and digital tax prep. Last year, we brought together tax policy and consumer advocate thought leaders at a forum in Washington, D.C. to discuss this very problem, and to announce the findings of our survey regarding consumer awareness and attitudes toward tax fraud. I have testified before the Senate Finance Committee and met with numerous members of both the house and senate regarding EITC and the need for professional standards for tax preparers. \r\nOur efforts are producing results. Late last year, on December 16, Congress directed the Treasury Department to implement consistent requirements across all tax-preparation methods for taxpayers applying for credits such as the EITC. Now treasury needs to implement the requirements in time for tax season 2016, which I'll address shortly. I have issued a call to action for the IRS and my colleagues within the tax-preparation industry to come together to create solutions to these problems. Recently, IRS Commissioner, Koskinen, announced that he will convene a meeting to facilitate this discussion. There are both long and short-term solutions to consider, but 2 immediate actions should be taken to minimize the potential for fraud. First, there must be minimum federal competency standards for all tax preparers. As you've heard me say before, all 50 states impose licensing requirements for cutting hair, but currently, there are no federal standards on competency applicable to all pay tax preparers, and only 4 states have such standards. This isn't about simply creating another category of professionals, it's about empowering and protecting the 60% of consumers who get help with their taxes every year. \r\nSecond, we need to address the $16 billion to $19 billion of annual improper payments related to the Earned Income Tax Credit. Having different standards for different methods of tax return preparation is encouraging fraudulent behavior in the DIY channel. Since 2008, when the inconsistent standards came into play, there has been a 14-point increase in the proportion of EITC filers using do-it-yourself preparation methods from 28% then to 42% in 2014. During this same period, the broader market filing patterns did not change materially. Considering that 20% of all tax returns include the EITC, a shift of this magnitude has a significant impact on improper payments and the overall industry. This move from assisted to DIY allows the taxpayer to avoid having to answer up to 27 additional questions on a separate tax form to determine EITC eligibility. Additionally, assisted tax preparers are now personally liable for properly completing the additional EITC form. This has resulted in fraudulent tax preparers acting as ghostwriters by completing taxes for their clients on a DIY platform without the preparer signing the return. As I mentioned earlier, on December 16, Congress directed the Treasury Department to implement consistent standards for these credits by saying the following: \"In an effort to reduce intentional fraud and filing errors in refundable credit programs intended to help taxpayers, the Department of the Treasury is directed to ensure that the same questions are being asked of taxpayers, whether they are preparing their returns with a paid tax preparer or via do-it-yourself methods such as paper forms, preparation software or online preparation tools. Implementing uniform questions for refundable credit filers is a commonsense step that will help alleviate confusion over eligibility and better establish qualifications for these credits.\"\r\nThat sounds pretty clear to me. We agree with Congress, but this is common sense. In contrast, the largest competitor in the DIY space has said that consistent standards present taxpayers with a \"compliance burden.\" It is both ridiculous and self-serving to suggest that requiring consistent fraud screens to fix a $16 billion to $19 billion problem is too great of a burden to bear. It is also ridiculous that one group of taxpayers should have to answer a series of up to 27 questions to obtain the credit while another group is not held to the same standard. This is crucial to protect the people eligible for the credit and to prevent fraudsters from abusing the system at the expense of those that need it most. As these consistent standards have yet to be implemented by the Treasury Department, we will continue to advocate for such standards, and for Treasury to develop and implement a plan in time for tax season 2016. As I said earlier, we've been leading the fight against tax fraud for some time, and it's clear that taxpayers are ready for change as 93% of those surveyed by H&R Block are willing to do more to help combat fraud. Additionally, as long as tax fraud is allowed to persist, it will be difficult to get a true read on the overall industry and as such, its impact on our results. \r\nH&R Block will continue to lead the charge against tax return fraud, and I urge my fellow industry leaders to join me in this fight. Our message has been and is clear, as an industry, we need to do the right thing.\r\nGiven that overview, industry overview, I'd now like to talk about our early season results. To be clear, I am disappointed in our first half assisted volume. While we do not anticipate fully making up this loss of assisted returns and share in the second half of the season, we have reason to look forward to a stronger second half. Filing patterns within our client base as well as changes within the industry suggest we are seeing a shift in the timing of our business. Consistent with the past 2 years, our assisted filers are moving out of the traditional first peak and shifting toward a more delayed filing schedule. Part of this is likely due to the speed of refund processing by the IRS and state governments. While it used to take months to receive your refund after filing your taxes, you may now receive your money in as little as 8 days. Additionally, part of this is likely due to delays related to the ACA that I mentioned earlier. \r\nDespite this shift, we continue to experience success in our Tax Plus strategy to drive revenues through improved monetization and product attached. By focusing on the optimal return mix with strong product attach rates, we are seeing positive financial results despite a significant decline in assisted unit counts to date. Unit count is not the sole determinant of success in this industry. We have learned over the years that giving away our product to drive client count without regard for profitability doesn't work. There is a significant portion of taxpayers who are solely motivated by cost, and thus, are not loyal. This means that monetizing these clients in the long run often doesn't happen no matter which channel, assisted or DIY, they use to prepare their taxes. \r\nIn addition to the timing shift, the lower assisted volume stems from our decision to discontinue unprofitable promotions in prior years and the migration to DIY as a result of fraud. Consistent with last year, assisted return declines have been greater in lower value returns, as we continue to focus our efforts on those returns that contribute most significantly to the bottom line.\r\nOur 50% off promotion is targeting just those types of returns, as it is designed to attract more complex, higher value returns at a time when our offices historically have had available capacity.\r\nOn the digital side, I'm very pleased with all aspects of our business, our product performance, the client experience, our pricing, our marketing campaigns and our results. Revenues are up, and we have increased unit sales from the prior year in both our desktop and online products. Our multiyear effort to enhance our product and improve the client experience is yielding positive results, providing our clients with a fully responsive personalized experience is driving an improvement in client satisfaction, which ultimately translates to the top line. \r\nOnline e-files are up 7.2% and desktop is up 5%, as we are benefiting from competitors' pricing decisions and from well-targeted promotions. Overall, unit growth for digital is up 6.7% from last year. And even more importantly, our mix of paid versus free returns has dramatically improved. \r\nOur Tax Plus products continue to provide tremendous value to our clients. Our newest product, Tax Identity Shield, is an innovative product that offers our clients tax identity theft protection and support. Given the significant increase in tax identity theft, it is a timely offering that provides our customers the added comfort of knowing that they have protection and support, and is an example of H&R Block's innovation and knowledge of the tax industry. And for the second consecutive year, our Emerald Card has been rated as one of the top 3 prepaid debit cards in the market by a leading consumer advocacy publication.\r\nTo summarize, we've invested more than anyone in this industry in the ACA, we continue to lead the charge in the fight against tax fraud, and I believe our value proposition is the best in the industry. Considering all the factors I've discussed today, we won't have a full understanding of the tax season until after April 15. This season so far has been challenging, but we have reason to look forward to a stronger second half. We intend to stay fully focused on serving our clients, however they want to be served, whether by coming to our offices to get assistance from our experienced tax professionals or through our best-in-class digital offerings.\r\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Greg to discuss the fiscal third quarter financial results.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nThanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everybody. As a reminder, given the seasonality of our business, and the fact that the significant majority of our revenue and all of our earnings come in the fourth quarter, our third quarter results generally are not indicative of the results we expect to achieve for the full year. As Bill mentioned, the IRS opened e-file earlier this year than in 2014. Because we recognize tax-preparation fees when completed returns are filed with the IRS, we recognize an additional 11 days in revenue in the third quarter fiscal 2015.\r\nOverall, revenues for the quarter were $509 million, representing an increase of $309 million compared to the prior-year quarter. Net loss from continuing operations was $35 million or $0.13 per share compared to a net loss of $213 million or $0.78 per share in the prior year. For the full fiscal year, we continue to target adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 30%.\r\nWe continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with excellent liquidity. Cash and customer banking deposit balances were significantly higher at the end of the third quarter this year due to the earlier funding of refunds by the IRS. The total unrestricted cash balance was $1.3 billion, and total outstanding debt was $1.1 billion, which includes $591 million in commercial paper borrowings. And as a reminder, we repaid a $400 million note in October 2014, leaving us with $500 million in senior notes as of January 31.\r\nFinally, we expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 to be at the lower end of the range provided at our Investor Day in December of 35.5% to 36.5%.\r\nTurning to our segment results. Tax Services revenues increased $309 million to $503 million as a result of the earlier e-filing opening date. Consistent with expectations, total operating expenses increased $62 million to $571 million. The increase is due to variable costs associated with tax return preparation, expenses related to acquire franchise operations, increased training costs related to both the ACA and our new tax-preparation software and increased marketing. Additionally, depreciation, amortization increased as a result of the franchise buybacks we discussed at our Investor Conference on December 9. As a reminder, we stated that we were looking to reacquire a portion of the 650 offices sold to franchisees several years ago. This fiscal year, we repurchased 341 of those locations for approximately $100 million. In addition, we have spent approximately $12 million on other acquisitions, primarily of independent tax preparers. Going forward, we will continue to evaluate potential franchise buybacks and independent targets. However, we do not expect the overall mix of company run versus franchise locations to change materially. We continue to expect depreciation and amortization expenses of $160 million to $170 million for the fiscal year 2015. Included in this is amortization expense related to these acquisitions of $14 million, with an annualized rate of $19 million for the fiscal year 2016.\r\nIn our corporate segment, our pretax loss decreased $10 million to $15 million mainly due to decreased interest expense as a result of the repayment of the $400 million note in October of 2014. Reduced legal and consulting fees also contributed to a reduction in expenses.\r\nTurning to discontinued operations. The net loss from discontinued operations was $2 million. During the third quarter, Sand Canyon entered into a settlement agreement with a counterparty related to its representation in warranty obligations. The settlement amount was fully covered by prior accruals and was paid in the fiscal third quarter. Sand Canyon's accrual for contingent losses relating to representation of warranty claims totaled $144 million as of January 31. Sand Canyon continues to engage in constructive settlement discussions with the counterparties, from which it has received a significant majority of its asserted claims. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is, and always has been, operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate veil-cursing arguments.\r\nLastly, turning to H&R Block Bank. We continue to work with BofI and our regulators and believe that on its merits, this transaction should be approved. We will continue to provide updates as we make progress. We've covered a lot in today's call, so we'll now turn it over to your questions. Operator?",
      "transcript_text3": "If you look kind of at the early season, Bill, is there any reason that you can come up with, why maybe your volumes are falling behind kind of the high res numbers? Have you come across something that you think is the primary catalyst for this?\n\n---\n\nAs we said, I think, in the press release, we do think there is a delay. The IRS released some numbers earlier today. And with the overall industry, total returns was down 0.6%. At the same time last year, it was up 1.4%. So you have right there, just year-on-year, a 2-point shift. So -- and we're seeing this certainly in our offices where it seems like clients are coming in later, whether it's form delays or whatever. The ACA confusion, form delays, form errors, has also contributed to this. I think we have had a carryover effect from a retention spiral, from kind of getting away from the free EZ. We had an impact last year. I think there is a carryover impact this year. And frankly, and this is why I spend a long time on this. Until EITC filers are generally early-season filers, until we get consistent standards, that shift, that migration from -- away from paid preparers, who haven't answered 27 questions and verify a bunch of information. New open season is going to contribute to that shift. So I don't have one thing that has contributed to it. I mean, obviously, as I said in my comments, I'm disappointed, but there are some factors that I think point to, if you will, beyond our control. But we are working very hard, and I do think we have a lot of reasons to have a positive outlook for the remainder of the season.\n\n---\n\nAnd I do want to add a caution on to that statement. I think it's very misleading and difficult. Mike shared this with you all before. I think the unit count numbers can be misunderstood pretty easily. Mix matters very much in this industry. And so we're very much -- as much focused on new as we are mix. And also, there's still a lot of season to go here. So the IRS headline today is 3 out of 5 filers still have to file for the rest of the year. So those are my thoughts as well.\n\n---\n\nAnd so I know this is difficult at this time around because of what happened last year with the delay in filing, but looking at the revenue miss you talked about last year and kind of trying to normalize revenue this year versus last year, you have been very good about getting pricing. And obviously, that has the ancillary products have helped you there. And if I did my math right, it seems like it could be pricing is probably in the high-single digits, maybe even low-double digits. Is that accurate? And would you be able to sustain that type of pricing because of mix and ancillary products going into the rest of the tax season?\n\n---\n\nSo I'm not going to obviously comment on your math, Kartik. What we have said generally is we know we've got pricing power in this industry, and we would typically say that's somewhere north of the rate of inflation. There's no reason to not think that's true for us this year. The other thing, specifically for 2014 tax season -- 2015 tax season for 2014 is the implementation of ACA. So part of our pricing strategy going into this season obviously had to include the value and the cost that we're incurring for our clients to deliver the service. And we're going to charge for that this year. And so far, we've been very pleased at the results there. Other than that, we're not going to give specific pricing thoughts until really post-season.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just one last question, Bill. I think -- I just want to make sure I heard you correctly in your prepared remarks. Did you say that because of where you are in terms of client count, it will be difficult to make that u? So therefore, difficult to get to kind of flat or positive client count? Or do you think that's still possible since we have a significant amount of the tax season still left?\n\n---\n\nYes, what I said was I think it will be difficult to fully recover that number of clients. I do think we will -- I think there are a lot of our clients still to come in. I think that's consistent with what we've seen in the past, where generally we'll start off softer than others in the beginning of the year. But in terms of whether we are able to crawl all the way back, I don't think we'll be able to do that, but I think we're going to have a much stronger second half.\n\n---\n\nSo what proportion of your customers ended up having to, so far year-to-date, season-to-date, have had to either fill out a new form because of the Affordable Care Act or have to move up from a more simple form to a more complicated form because of the changes to healthcare this year?\n\n---\n\nYes. So I don't think we're -- Gil, we're going to give specific numbers or on forms, et cetera. I would say that what Mark had talked about at Investor Day, we anticipated about 25% of our clients would be impacted. The numbers we have seen so far indicate that we are under that number at this point in the season, as Greg just cautioned. I think we've got to wait and see this all play out because of some of the externalities that you heard about. But in terms of any form shifts, I don't -- we're not going to get into that right now. But Mark, is there anything you want to add to that?\n\n---\n\nWell, I will say as we anticipated, many of our clients and consumers in general are really feeling the full effects of the Affordable Care Act this year. And we're seeing that, obviously have some impact on their filing behavior, we believe, and they're confronting a new level of complexity. And as Bill mentioned, some of those clients are actually seeing surprises in terms of their refund behavior or their refund effects. But we've always said this is a long-term proposition. We believe many clients will be impacted this year. They're on the learning curve. Many more clients will be impacted next year, frankly, on the basis of the enrollment numbers we've seen. So we're going to see the rest of this year play out, but this is really a long-term impact that would just be at the front end of seeing.\n\n---\n\nYes, and I think we've talked about that before. I think Greg has continually cautioned against this. Next year, they'll -- you won't just be able to self-attest if you have insurance. So there are changes that are coming. And when you go into something like this, where the intersection of something like the Affordable Care Act with taxes seems so counterintuitive to so many consumers, and the awareness was low, we're seeing a little bit of that play out. I think as things get more comfortable, there might be more, if you will, normal patterns. But right now, I'm not sure I could predict what a normal pattern is any more on the assisted side. So we'll see how this plays out.\n\n---\n\nAnd then in terms of fraud, which has really taken off this year, and as you pointed out, it sounds like it's less of an issue for you than some of your competitors. What are you doing in terms of the specific measures? Are you introducing multifactor authentication? Do you plan to do that? Do you plan to maintain the bundling of state and federal to prevent state filing-specific fraud? How are you handling the -- what you're seeing from your competitors in terms of your policies and technology for handling fraud?\n\n---\n\nI'm going to let Jason get in there. I would say one thing Gil, is that for any CEO, this is of paramount importance, the whole area of cyber security. We're fighting against a number of bad guys here. This has of a high concern. I think we've talked about this. Frankly, I think I said it at Investor Day, we're kind of the lone voice here, although there are a lot more voices here. But why don't we talk about the specifics that we do, Jason, if you could take that?\n\n---\n\nSure. Thanks, Gil. So what I would say first is that Intuit is really late joining this conversation. We've had a number of fraud filters in place for multiple years. First, from -- we have multifactor authentication within our login process, and that's been in place since 2011. Our password strength for our online accounts has some of the strongest requirements in the industry, and we do not allow unlinked returns to be filed to states. That is to say that we actually require an accepted federal e-file before we even send or file the state return. And as we previously indicated, our internal fraud monitoring team has not seen any unusual fraud activity this tax season.\n\n---\n\nYes. And we think that, ultimately, those points are really key. And I think what happened this year was by not waiting until the federal return was accepted by the IRS, which has the strongest fraud filters, it's hard for any individual state to match the power of the IRS. So that's why we hadn't put this policy in place, so we had to -- we wanted an accepted return by the IRS before we would file the state. And I think that's where the fraudsters crack the code.\n\n---\n\nSo at your Investor Day, you said that you expected the industry assisted volumes to grow 0% to 1% and digital to grow 4% to 5%. Can you just update us on your thinking now?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think we're trying to figure that out. Frankly, Thomas, I do think that the digital number, the number that came out today, which will probably fall over time, but it was roughly 6% for the total digital business. Paper returns, according to today's numbers, were down 13%. And right now, assisted is down 4.4%. That will improve over time. That's been the history here. We still believe that the overall industry will grow 1.5% or in that range. But when you're down 0.6% and you're more than 40% of the way through, you're a little bit questioning that. But we believe that with the delay, all the stuff that's happened, generally, people still have to file in this industry. And I believe it's going to be a much stronger second half.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then can you just touch on the competitive environment? I mean, you wrote about it in your prepared remarks. And obviously, there's been a lot of talk around pricing adjustments and marketing. So can you just talk about how you feel the environment is?\n\n---\n\nWell, I mean, it's always very competitive out there. There's a lot of factors in the industry, obviously on the digital side, the launch of the free product by Turbo, going after the low end hadn't -- drove there. Then the number of filings they had, I don't know if we ever fully figured out how many of those were due to that and due to fraud. In terms of -- I think we had a very competitive offering, certainly in the digital phase, with the program Jason put together with the $9.99 program. Certainly, with -- we were really pleased with the marketing there. We're really pleased with how the new product is working. On the assisted side, there were some things done in terms of some cash giveaways. And then add that to the price that were done out there. We're still trying to assess the impact on that and some morale behavior that we'll have to see how that all plays out. So it's been a highly competitive start to the season, coupled with delays for -- consumer delays. So it's a little hard to read, and that's why we'll say this 14 more times probably on this call, we've got to wait and see how everything plays out.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just a short question on -- specific to your business. So you guys talked about how you bought a number of franchisees. But then when we look at your return volumes, your franchisee volumes are better than your company-owned stores. Why is that?\n\n---\n\nThe table that we released actually adjusts for that factor in there. So we've reclassified what would have been franchised last year in the company to make it more apples-to-apples, Thomas.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And so -- okay. Well, that explains most of it, but should we expect the franchisees to kind of -- to outperform the company-owned stores through the -- like through the season, what, after adjusted or not?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, historically, I think we're pretty close on both there. We have no reason to believe that's not true this year.\n\n---\n\nIt's Henry Chien calling in for Jeff. I just had a question on the legislation to potentially give the IRS authority to regulate preparers. Have you heard any progress on that front? And with the recent news of fraud and some of the attention there, has that shifted maybe some of the regulatory momentum to more standardized requirements for DIY versus assisted? Just any comments that you have there.\n\n---\n\nWell, here's what I would say. I mean, obviously, you have 2 different issues. The EITC issue, Congress has already directed the Treasury Department to implement the consistent standards. It's a matter of the Treasury Department doing it. In terms of return preparer, that has to go the other way, which Congress has to now initiate that as a law. We are working hard at that. I think, frankly, there is a lot of talk. We're certainly, with our government relations team working very closely with a lot of aspects of government, that the tax fraud that has come up here, the amount of dollars that are being doled out in losses and improper payments, I think that there are certainly a lot of -- a lot more awareness around this, which we hope will add to the effort around finally getting competency standards nationally. We're not sitting around. I mean, we're very active at the federal level. We're also working at the state level to try to increase the number of states who require competency and licensing.\n\n---\n\nAnd importantly, this season, 2 states have now introduced return preparer standards, New York State being the primary one of those. Then there's several other states that we would think are likely to have them in place for next year.\n\n---\n\nAnd if I could tack one on, on the pricing side. I know there's been some confusion around ACA's forms, but just from what you've seen so far, are you seeing based on your expectations or what are you planning for? Are you still seeing any pricing lift from ACA just overall in general?\n\n---\n\nSo we, just as a matter of policy, don't talk at form level pricing it's just not something we do. Having said that, we did go into this season, spent a lot of time and a lot of money getting our people ready and our systems ready to help our clients through this very difficult transaction. And we've added value to their lives, and we're going to charge for that. And so certainly, we've got a pricing strategy around ACA. It really is going to be dependent on your situation, frankly, what price you'll pay, and it's a bit more complex than just a simple number. But the kind of takeaway I would say thus far is we're actually very pleased with the price value equation, and so are our clients.\n\n---\n\nGreg, I'm going to follow on that one. I know you don't speak specifically on forms, but it sounds like you are pleased with what you're seeing, particularly in mix, I'd say across the board. Were there any significant rate increases, excluding ACA from the conversation, this year, year-over-year on any forms in the storefront area?\n\n---\n\nThe way we price is really based on bundle experiences. And so a bundle would be a typical client experience that covers a large number of people from one year to the next. So the way I'm -- the reason I'm sharing that with you is there will always be, unfortunately, some exceptions where persons -- circumstances are so unique that they get caught up in just the way that bundle get priced out. But in general, we have been very thoughtful about price sticker shock. If someone, for example, went from a 1040EZ, and because they have ACA forms, would automatically have to go to a 1040A or a 1040 form type. That was something that we certainly factored in because we obviously are looking to have a long-term relationship, not a 1-year relationship, with these clients.\n\n---\n\nOkay, fair enough. Bill, one for you. This is going to be, I think, the first that you mentioned you're going to get this 13 more times. The -- and I already know the answer, but I'm asking it nonetheless. There are multiple reasons that you listed in the press release, and then you added on this call fraud as a potential reason that we saw more DIY as opposed to assisted in the early part of the season. My question specifically is, of the I count 5 or 6 reasons that you've put out there vocally or in print, I know the answer is it's too early to tell, but in your personal opinion, what would you rank is the top 3 ideally and in descending order, if possible?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think -- all right. I'll take a shot at it. I'll answer your answer. And say we've got to wait and see. However, I do think that the delay in this, the stats that the IRS put out today, and as I said, there clearly appears to be a shift of consumer behavior later in the season. So when you have a 2-point swing year-over-year, that certainly speaks to delay. I think the second piece is there's really 2 fraud issues broadly. There's all the DIY fraud I spoke about earlier. There's also, with the IRS saying things like their budget cutbacks, they can't do as many audits, we continue to see, and as we've been very active in the A&D space, the amount of fraud done by independents is startling. And that's why the return preparer is so important because we think that getting people who have to sign a -- take a competency exam and be licensed and sign the return is critically important. And then the third piece, I'd say, is around all the externalities around ACA. Now that is not the quantitative answer that you want, but if you just asked my opinion, I would say those are the 3.\n\n---\n\nAll right. No, I appreciate that, and that is what I was looking for. One follow-up on point 2 that you just mentioned, you are trailing the IRS, the industry year-to-date on professionally prepared. And obviously there's a lot of ground to make up. You just mentioned that you're seeing a lot of fraud in professionally prepared among the mom and pops. Is that something that you think will be a pressure in the back half, where you may not narrow the gap of yourself in the industry or even turn it to the other side? Or is that more of an early-season phenomena that will dissipate here in the back half?\n\n---\n\nGenerally, it's been an early -- the history has been an early-season impact, but we'll have to wait and see.\n\n---\n\nA lot of it's surrounding earned income credit filers, and they tend to be early-season filers.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just a couple more, if I can, going around in other areas. You put out a press release with regard to Canada looking more aggressive with your do-it-yourself product. I'm curious, since your strategy last year, and continued this year at least in the U.S., is to pursue revenue and unless -- that's the primary focus, and all that entails, it feels like you're taking almost a counterstrategy in Canada. Just curious what the thinking is there.\n\n---\n\nEach country that we operate in has a unique strategy, of course, tied to the overall company mission here, but Canada's situation is much different than the U.S. There, we had no presence to speak of in the DIY space at all, and we have Intuit as the largest market participant there. And we think that's going to have to change, and we're prepared to be in that for many years to think what we want to do is win our fair share. And we're prepared to spend the money to get there.\n\n---\n\nAnd a follow-up there, it looks like I can't come to any way that you're going to be monetizing with perhaps a cross-sell or anything that strategy this year, and I think your answer also suggest it's longer term. Is that true? It's not a this-year impact? It's more down the line?\n\n---\n\nIt's a multiyear strategy that we've embarked upon, and we're prepared to, as I said, fund it during that timeframe. But I will just tell you in the grand scheme of things, it's not a material number for most shareholders.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then before I clean up, I want to sneak 1 or 2 more in. The $50 million reduction in the loan loss reserves, and clearly, there was some settlement, but clearly, there's an existing amount on the loan loss reserve in Sand Canyon. So it's not all settled. Greg, can you share a little bit more about what occurred? Why wasn't it a complete settlement? It sounds very productive and good, but I just was just kind of curious why partial.\n\n---\n\nYes. And just to clarify, I know you have this, Scott, but these are reserves for representation on warranty, not claims, not loan losses or such. But in the last quarter, third quarter of this fiscal year, Sand Canyon did enter into a specific settlement agreement with a counterparty, and that was fully reserved for in the reserve. The reserve itself moved down by $50 million, which was a fairly material number and was paid out during that quarter. So I think that's good progress. The reserve itself is also supported by other claimants that Sand Canyon's engaged in, having productive conversations. I know that many people would like to get better clarity in a timeline, but the reality is that these are still processed, and it just takes time, but our words continue to be consistent that there's forward progress being made here. The gain's just one resolved, I think, is an indication that there is progress.\n\n---\n\nAnd then lastly, we're going slip it in. The bank, really not much discussed on this call, I don't know that you're going to share much more, but is there a level 2, deeper open question that you care to share with us at this point?\n\n---\n\nOn the bank -- sort of the bank transaction?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, it's the transaction that we got with BofI is a good transaction for BofI. It's a good transaction for H&R Block. It's been with the regulator now for a year plus. We believe on the merits and the structure of the transaction will be approved. For us, we really just have to get it approved and implemented for next tax season. So we've got a fair amount of time to work with right now. Obviously, if we can get it approved well before that, that would be excellent and closed, but our position remains the same, that we think it will be approved. And it's really up to those regulators ultimately, though.\n\n---\n\nAny increase, decrease in communication with the regulator? Anything that you would share outside or...\n\n---\n\nYes, both ourselves and BofI have regular conversations with the regulator in a normal course business. And of course, as we have appropriate questions come in, as it relates to this transaction, we would respond to those as thoroughly and as quickly as we can. We continue to be in a position where we're really just waiting for the most part at this point for a resolution, but there's been no change in the frequency or type of questions that we've seen in the last several months.\n\n---\n\nJust a couple of quick questions. On the competitive dynamics touched upon earlier in your prepared remarks, and not being able to fill that hole on assisted versus the IRS filings, do you have a sense whether these filers have gone to other preparers? Are they going to DIY? Do you have a sense of where they're going to?\n\n---\n\nWell, the overall assisted business, the latest numbers from the IRS is down 4.5% season to date. So obviously, the whole area of assisted is suffering. We're a little worse than that, but there seems to be assisted. Digital is about in line in terms of their growth rate with what we had talked about. I have reason to believe that the points I was making in my prepared remarks is that the EITC migration will get higher. Until Treasury implements the directive from Congress next year and the EITC filer on the DIY basis has a free lane, I think that point shift is going to go higher than 40 -- 42%. But we'll have to see how that plays out. So I think in that sense, yes, there would be a shift. I think overall, we think that the -- when the season is done, the assisted to digital shift will be more in line with what it's been the past couple of seasons, which is primarily due to this EITC issue.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And I'm not sure if you touched upon this earlier, but I was wondering if you can comment on some of your strategies this season, enticing users of other preparers or software to switch to Block at half the cost or no cost. How does this fit with your strategy last year to a cut out low-margin filers? And what's the response been to these strategies this season?\n\n---\n\nWell, let me take the assisted side, and then, Jason, if you want to speak to the promotion we've done with the DIY. I think we had a plan before we started the season that during the mid-February to mid-March timeframe, when we generally have available capacity, we wanted to be aggressive with trying to bring in new clients with our 50% off promotion. We're right in the middle of that right now. We'll see how that plays out, but that was a care -- a considered strategy really from a capacity basis, and in terms of trying to drive against picking up more clients. So that was the idea behind the assisted side. As far as DIY goes, Jason, why don't you talk about the overall integrated plan we put together?\n\n---\n\nSure. Well, first, in desktop, we saw opportunity to give very dissatisfied TurboTax clients the opportunity to try our product. And by doing so, we felt like that they would recognize it's the best value in tax software. Really, we call this switch to block, which offer TurboTax clients, who send us a copy of their receipt, free H&R Block Deluxe software. Well, we're very pleased with the response of this, but more importantly, we're pleased with our desktop share performance in the early season. We estimate we've taken about 3 points in market share in desktop. And even though our results to-date in e-file is desktop up 5%, our unit sales are up much stronger than that. And again, this is a really nice high-value client and one that we are actively attracting.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And one for Greg. I just wanted to make sure. I wasn't clear on this. Are there more franchise purchases coming this year or have you bought all the ones that you're expecting to for 2015?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think the vast majority of them we completed this season. There may be some small changes next year, but the material part of it was done in 2015 fiscal year.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And one final one. If you can answer it, I'd appreciate it. Just wondering, we saw the dates in the merger agreement and get revised further out. I believe it's now June 30. Wondering if there's any rhyme or reason as to how you choose those dates? Why isn't it May 30 or July 31?\n\n---\n\nSo there is rhyme and there is reason, for sure. The answer is that we use those dates, I mean, of course, between BofI and ourselves to make sure that we're in agreement, but we've also used them as a way to help have a conversation with the regulators. So I wouldn't, from a broadest perspective, I wouldn't get too concerned about them. As you've already seen, we can, with BofI's agreement, move on as we need to. But we do think those are good timelines to work towards and helps us again have that conversation with the regulator.\n\n---\n\nCan you tell us to what share of the ACA business you did or have done to date?\n\n---\n\nYes, Mike, I'm going to let this season play out before we get into anything like that. I don't think we -- I'm not even sure how we would get that number, but we'll obviously give you a full readout at the end of the season.\n\n---\n\nI guess, what I was looking at is whether you're getting more than your average share of the total market.\n\n---\n\nUnclear at this point. As I said, we are under the number that we anticipated for the early season. But beyond that, I wouldn't hazard a guess. So I think we'll have a better feel for that at the end of the season.\n\n---\n\nWhat we do know, Mike, is that the average H&R Block client is twice as likely to be impacted by the ACA than the average American, simply because of the customer profile that we serve, is the people that this is really targeted towards. So ultimately, we're going to have more market share just because of that. But within that standard, the question really is going to be answered better at the end of the season, as Bill said.\n\n---\n\nI mean, I think the one concern we have is, frankly, in the digital space. And do you want to talk about that Jason, specifically?\n\n---\n\nSure. Well, I think it's important to point out that we actually don't have the same experience in our tax software. As a company, we feel it's critical to create and file an accurate tax return, and there's a big difference in how our tax software versus TurboTax works, specifically when you're talking about the Affordable Care Act. With H&R Block tax software, we require the filer to input his or her 1095-A in order to file. By contrast, TurboTax does not require this, which would mean that it may be easier to actually file the return using TurboTax, but the return is not going to be accurate. And in fact, it will actually put the return directly in the IRS special processing, which means that they're going to -- the taxpayer can file, they'll get an accepted return, but then they're going to get a mail, snail mail from the IRS, which will require 8 to 12 weeks of additional time and an amended return in order to then complete their return.\n\n---\n\nWell, maybe you've just explained a question I was going to ask. It seems surprising that for the erroneous 1095s, that only less than 10% of them had already been filed by, I guess, mid-February.\n\n---\n\nSo this is Mark. This is -- Mike, this is a little bit different answer. What Jason was speaking to were people that enrolled in the marketplace and need to reconcile using a Form 8962, and those folks need to use a 1095-A. What you're speaking to is another issue that was recently announced by HHS that indicated that they had corrected 1095-As. In other words, the federal marketplace and some other state-based marketplaces, including California, had put out notices that indicated that the 1095s they had sent out were incorrect. And I think following that, HHS indicated that 90% to 95% of those folks hadn't yet filed. And so the vast majority of the folks that have to reconcile, which are virtually all of the people that enrolled in the marketplace last year, still have yet to file. That's -- I think that's the information there. But those folks are either going to have to amend their returns if they use their incorrect 1095-A or they're waiting to receive their corrected 1095-As. And that's, we think, contributing a little bit to the delays we're seeing.\n\n---\n\nI guess the question is you would've thought that they would be lower income, they would tend to file earlier than average?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think as Bill already mentioned in his comments, we originally thought that we would see a higher percentage of ACA-impacted clients, but it's turning out that we are probably going to see those clients spread throughout the tax season instead.\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, we -- I hate to sound the way that this is going to sound, we have to let this play out. But in consumer behavior, anytime you have a new service, a new initiative that was instituted by the government, you've got to wait and see how it plays out. That was our anticipation. It is not played out that way. We still believe with the form errors that Mark just talked about in general, that more ACA people will be coming in over the last 6 weeks.\n\n---\n\nMaybe I missed something you said. Looking at the revenues, you're going to be up about 4x for returns that are not quite up that much. Am I missing some arithmetic here?\n\n---\n\nAre you talking about the third quarter results, Mike?\n\n---\n\nThird quarter.\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, the third -- I think you have to be very careful looking at our third quarter financial results and extrapolating at this point. This was simply timing, e-file being open there in 11 days. We had a lot of returns last year that we had completed, but we weren't able to file them in because e-file was only open for one day in January last year. And even then, we had a limited number we could get in the door. So you do have that discrepancy. And so I really would be cautious in drawing too many conclusions from those comparisons.\n\n---\n\nI see. And then a question, over the last several years, we've seen, at least on IRS numbers, that assisted has either been flatfish up, almost de minimis increases. Where is this going in the future?\n\n---\n\nWell, Mike, I mean, here's if -- this is why I'm spending an awful lot of time on this. If the government does not make moves to combat tax fraud, some of the things that we've done, that Jason outlined earlier, equalizing the standards on EITC, because that's been a significant shift, having competency exams and background checks and everything else on return preparers, I think assisted is going to struggle because it has really come to the forefront this year how bad the fraud is in this industry, and that's something we as -- and that's why I'm saying I'm glad to hear Commissioner Koskinen is going to convene a group. I think we, as industry leaders, have to come together to protect the American public, but there have to be some changes to -- these are huge numbers, and consumers are suffering for this, when they get a notice that their tax return has been filed and they haven't filed it yet.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Have a great day. We'll talk to you soon. Bye.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nIf you look kind of at the early season, Bill, is there any reason that you can come up with, why maybe your volumes are falling behind kind of the high res numbers? Have you come across something that you think is the primary catalyst for this?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nAs we said, I think, in the press release, we do think there is a delay. The IRS released some numbers earlier today. And with the overall industry, total returns was down 0.6%. At the same time last year, it was up 1.4%. So you have right there, just year-on-year, a 2-point shift. So -- and we're seeing this certainly in our offices where it seems like clients are coming in later, whether it's form delays or whatever. The ACA confusion, form delays, form errors, has also contributed to this. I think we have had a carryover effect from a retention spiral, from kind of getting away from the free EZ. We had an impact last year. I think there is a carryover impact this year. And frankly, and this is why I spend a long time on this. Until EITC filers are generally early-season filers, until we get consistent standards, that shift, that migration from -- away from paid preparers, who haven't answered 27 questions and verify a bunch of information. New open season is going to contribute to that shift. So I don't have one thing that has contributed to it. I mean, obviously, as I said in my comments, I'm disappointed, but there are some factors that I think point to, if you will, beyond our control. But we are working very hard, and I do think we have a lot of reasons to have a positive outlook for the remainder of the season.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nAnd I do want to add a caution on to that statement. I think it's very misleading and difficult. Mike shared this with you all before. I think the unit count numbers can be misunderstood pretty easily. Mix matters very much in this industry. And so we're very much -- as much focused on new as we are mix. And also, there's still a lot of season to go here. So the IRS headline today is 3 out of 5 filers still have to file for the rest of the year. So those are my thoughts as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nAnd so I know this is difficult at this time around because of what happened last year with the delay in filing, but looking at the revenue miss you talked about last year and kind of trying to normalize revenue this year versus last year, you have been very good about getting pricing. And obviously, that has the ancillary products have helped you there. And if I did my math right, it seems like it could be pricing is probably in the high-single digits, maybe even low-double digits. Is that accurate? And would you be able to sustain that type of pricing because of mix and ancillary products going into the rest of the tax season?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nSo I'm not going to obviously comment on your math, Kartik. What we have said generally is we know we've got pricing power in this industry, and we would typically say that's somewhere north of the rate of inflation. There's no reason to not think that's true for us this year. The other thing, specifically for 2014 tax season -- 2015 tax season for 2014 is the implementation of ACA. So part of our pricing strategy going into this season obviously had to include the value and the cost that we're incurring for our clients to deliver the service. And we're going to charge for that this year. And so far, we've been very pleased at the results there. Other than that, we're not going to give specific pricing thoughts until really post-season.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nAnd then just one last question, Bill. I think -- I just want to make sure I heard you correctly in your prepared remarks. Did you say that because of where you are in terms of client count, it will be difficult to make that u? So therefore, difficult to get to kind of flat or positive client count? Or do you think that's still possible since we have a significant amount of the tax season still left?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, what I said was I think it will be difficult to fully recover that number of clients. I do think we will -- I think there are a lot of our clients still to come in. I think that's consistent with what we've seen in the past, where generally we'll start off softer than others in the beginning of the year. But in terms of whether we are able to crawl all the way back, I don't think we'll be able to do that, but I think we're going to have a much stronger second half.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gil Luria (Analysts)】\nSo what proportion of your customers ended up having to, so far year-to-date, season-to-date, have had to either fill out a new form because of the Affordable Care Act or have to move up from a more simple form to a more complicated form because of the changes to healthcare this year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes. So I don't think we're -- Gil, we're going to give specific numbers or on forms, et cetera. I would say that what Mark had talked about at Investor Day, we anticipated about 25% of our clients would be impacted. The numbers we have seen so far indicate that we are under that number at this point in the season, as Greg just cautioned. I think we've got to wait and see this all play out because of some of the externalities that you heard about. But in terms of any form shifts, I don't -- we're not going to get into that right now. But Mark, is there anything you want to add to that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Ciaramitaro (Executives)】\nWell, I will say as we anticipated, many of our clients and consumers in general are really feeling the full effects of the Affordable Care Act this year. And we're seeing that, obviously have some impact on their filing behavior, we believe, and they're confronting a new level of complexity. And as Bill mentioned, some of those clients are actually seeing surprises in terms of their refund behavior or their refund effects. But we've always said this is a long-term proposition. We believe many clients will be impacted this year. They're on the learning curve. Many more clients will be impacted next year, frankly, on the basis of the enrollment numbers we've seen. So we're going to see the rest of this year play out, but this is really a long-term impact that would just be at the front end of seeing.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, and I think we've talked about that before. I think Greg has continually cautioned against this. Next year, they'll -- you won't just be able to self-attest if you have insurance. So there are changes that are coming. And when you go into something like this, where the intersection of something like the Affordable Care Act with taxes seems so counterintuitive to so many consumers, and the awareness was low, we're seeing a little bit of that play out. I think as things get more comfortable, there might be more, if you will, normal patterns. But right now, I'm not sure I could predict what a normal pattern is any more on the assisted side. So we'll see how this plays out.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gil Luria (Analysts)】\nAnd then in terms of fraud, which has really taken off this year, and as you pointed out, it sounds like it's less of an issue for you than some of your competitors. What are you doing in terms of the specific measures? Are you introducing multifactor authentication? Do you plan to do that? Do you plan to maintain the bundling of state and federal to prevent state filing-specific fraud? How are you handling the -- what you're seeing from your competitors in terms of your policies and technology for handling fraud?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nI'm going to let Jason get in there. I would say one thing Gil, is that for any CEO, this is of paramount importance, the whole area of cyber security. We're fighting against a number of bad guys here. This has of a high concern. I think we've talked about this. Frankly, I think I said it at Investor Day, we're kind of the lone voice here, although there are a lot more voices here. But why don't we talk about the specifics that we do, Jason, if you could take that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nSure. Thanks, Gil. So what I would say first is that Intuit is really late joining this conversation. We've had a number of fraud filters in place for multiple years. First, from -- we have multifactor authentication within our login process, and that's been in place since 2011. Our password strength for our online accounts has some of the strongest requirements in the industry, and we do not allow unlinked returns to be filed to states. That is to say that we actually require an accepted federal e-file before we even send or file the state return. And as we previously indicated, our internal fraud monitoring team has not seen any unusual fraud activity this tax season.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes. And we think that, ultimately, those points are really key. And I think what happened this year was by not waiting until the federal return was accepted by the IRS, which has the strongest fraud filters, it's hard for any individual state to match the power of the IRS. So that's why we hadn't put this policy in place, so we had to -- we wanted an accepted return by the IRS before we would file the state. And I think that's where the fraudsters crack the code.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nSo at your Investor Day, you said that you expected the industry assisted volumes to grow 0% to 1% and digital to grow 4% to 5%. Can you just update us on your thinking now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, I think we're trying to figure that out. Frankly, Thomas, I do think that the digital number, the number that came out today, which will probably fall over time, but it was roughly 6% for the total digital business. Paper returns, according to today's numbers, were down 13%. And right now, assisted is down 4.4%. That will improve over time. That's been the history here. We still believe that the overall industry will grow 1.5% or in that range. But when you're down 0.6% and you're more than 40% of the way through, you're a little bit questioning that. But we believe that with the delay, all the stuff that's happened, generally, people still have to file in this industry. And I believe it's going to be a much stronger second half.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then can you just touch on the competitive environment? I mean, you wrote about it in your prepared remarks. And obviously, there's been a lot of talk around pricing adjustments and marketing. So can you just talk about how you feel the environment is?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nWell, I mean, it's always very competitive out there. There's a lot of factors in the industry, obviously on the digital side, the launch of the free product by Turbo, going after the low end hadn't -- drove there. Then the number of filings they had, I don't know if we ever fully figured out how many of those were due to that and due to fraud. In terms of -- I think we had a very competitive offering, certainly in the digital phase, with the program Jason put together with the $9.99 program. Certainly, with -- we were really pleased with the marketing there. We're really pleased with how the new product is working. On the assisted side, there were some things done in terms of some cash giveaways. And then add that to the price that were done out there. We're still trying to assess the impact on that and some morale behavior that we'll have to see how that all plays out. So it's been a highly competitive start to the season, coupled with delays for -- consumer delays. So it's a little hard to read, and that's why we'll say this 14 more times probably on this call, we've got to wait and see how everything plays out.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just a short question on -- specific to your business. So you guys talked about how you bought a number of franchisees. But then when we look at your return volumes, your franchisee volumes are better than your company-owned stores. Why is that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nThe table that we released actually adjusts for that factor in there. So we've reclassified what would have been franchised last year in the company to make it more apples-to-apples, Thomas.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Allen (Analysts)】\nOkay. And so -- okay. Well, that explains most of it, but should we expect the franchisees to kind of -- to outperform the company-owned stores through the -- like through the season, what, after adjusted or not?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, historically, I think we're pretty close on both there. We have no reason to believe that's not true this year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Henry Chien (Analysts)】\nIt's Henry Chien calling in for Jeff. I just had a question on the legislation to potentially give the IRS authority to regulate preparers. Have you heard any progress on that front? And with the recent news of fraud and some of the attention there, has that shifted maybe some of the regulatory momentum to more standardized requirements for DIY versus assisted? Just any comments that you have there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nWell, here's what I would say. I mean, obviously, you have 2 different issues. The EITC issue, Congress has already directed the Treasury Department to implement the consistent standards. It's a matter of the Treasury Department doing it. In terms of return preparer, that has to go the other way, which Congress has to now initiate that as a law. We are working hard at that. I think, frankly, there is a lot of talk. We're certainly, with our government relations team working very closely with a lot of aspects of government, that the tax fraud that has come up here, the amount of dollars that are being doled out in losses and improper payments, I think that there are certainly a lot of -- a lot more awareness around this, which we hope will add to the effort around finally getting competency standards nationally. We're not sitting around. I mean, we're very active at the federal level. We're also working at the state level to try to increase the number of states who require competency and licensing.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nAnd importantly, this season, 2 states have now introduced return preparer standards, New York State being the primary one of those. Then there's several other states that we would think are likely to have them in place for next year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Henry Chien (Analysts)】\nAnd if I could tack one on, on the pricing side. I know there's been some confusion around ACA's forms, but just from what you've seen so far, are you seeing based on your expectations or what are you planning for? Are you still seeing any pricing lift from ACA just overall in general?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nSo we, just as a matter of policy, don't talk at form level pricing it's just not something we do. Having said that, we did go into this season, spent a lot of time and a lot of money getting our people ready and our systems ready to help our clients through this very difficult transaction. And we've added value to their lives, and we're going to charge for that. And so certainly, we've got a pricing strategy around ACA. It really is going to be dependent on your situation, frankly, what price you'll pay, and it's a bit more complex than just a simple number. But the kind of takeaway I would say thus far is we're actually very pleased with the price value equation, and so are our clients.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nGreg, I'm going to follow on that one. I know you don't speak specifically on forms, but it sounds like you are pleased with what you're seeing, particularly in mix, I'd say across the board. Were there any significant rate increases, excluding ACA from the conversation, this year, year-over-year on any forms in the storefront area?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nThe way we price is really based on bundle experiences. And so a bundle would be a typical client experience that covers a large number of people from one year to the next. So the way I'm -- the reason I'm sharing that with you is there will always be, unfortunately, some exceptions where persons -- circumstances are so unique that they get caught up in just the way that bundle get priced out. But in general, we have been very thoughtful about price sticker shock. If someone, for example, went from a 1040EZ, and because they have ACA forms, would automatically have to go to a 1040A or a 1040 form type. That was something that we certainly factored in because we obviously are looking to have a long-term relationship, not a 1-year relationship, with these clients.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nOkay, fair enough. Bill, one for you. This is going to be, I think, the first that you mentioned you're going to get this 13 more times. The -- and I already know the answer, but I'm asking it nonetheless. There are multiple reasons that you listed in the press release, and then you added on this call fraud as a potential reason that we saw more DIY as opposed to assisted in the early part of the season. My question specifically is, of the I count 5 or 6 reasons that you've put out there vocally or in print, I know the answer is it's too early to tell, but in your personal opinion, what would you rank is the top 3 ideally and in descending order, if possible?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nWell, I think -- all right. I'll take a shot at it. I'll answer your answer. And say we've got to wait and see. However, I do think that the delay in this, the stats that the IRS put out today, and as I said, there clearly appears to be a shift of consumer behavior later in the season. So when you have a 2-point swing year-over-year, that certainly speaks to delay. I think the second piece is there's really 2 fraud issues broadly. There's all the DIY fraud I spoke about earlier. There's also, with the IRS saying things like their budget cutbacks, they can't do as many audits, we continue to see, and as we've been very active in the A&D space, the amount of fraud done by independents is startling. And that's why the return preparer is so important because we think that getting people who have to sign a -- take a competency exam and be licensed and sign the return is critically important. And then the third piece, I'd say, is around all the externalities around ACA. Now that is not the quantitative answer that you want, but if you just asked my opinion, I would say those are the 3.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nAll right. No, I appreciate that, and that is what I was looking for. One follow-up on point 2 that you just mentioned, you are trailing the IRS, the industry year-to-date on professionally prepared. And obviously there's a lot of ground to make up. You just mentioned that you're seeing a lot of fraud in professionally prepared among the mom and pops. Is that something that you think will be a pressure in the back half, where you may not narrow the gap of yourself in the industry or even turn it to the other side? Or is that more of an early-season phenomena that will dissipate here in the back half?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nGenerally, it's been an early -- the history has been an early-season impact, but we'll have to wait and see.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nA lot of it's surrounding earned income credit filers, and they tend to be early-season filers.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just a couple more, if I can, going around in other areas. You put out a press release with regard to Canada looking more aggressive with your do-it-yourself product. I'm curious, since your strategy last year, and continued this year at least in the U.S., is to pursue revenue and unless -- that's the primary focus, and all that entails, it feels like you're taking almost a counterstrategy in Canada. Just curious what the thinking is there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nEach country that we operate in has a unique strategy, of course, tied to the overall company mission here, but Canada's situation is much different than the U.S. There, we had no presence to speak of in the DIY space at all, and we have Intuit as the largest market participant there. And we think that's going to have to change, and we're prepared to be in that for many years to think what we want to do is win our fair share. And we're prepared to spend the money to get there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nAnd a follow-up there, it looks like I can't come to any way that you're going to be monetizing with perhaps a cross-sell or anything that strategy this year, and I think your answer also suggest it's longer term. Is that true? It's not a this-year impact? It's more down the line?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nIt's a multiyear strategy that we've embarked upon, and we're prepared to, as I said, fund it during that timeframe. But I will just tell you in the grand scheme of things, it's not a material number for most shareholders.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then before I clean up, I want to sneak 1 or 2 more in. The $50 million reduction in the loan loss reserves, and clearly, there was some settlement, but clearly, there's an existing amount on the loan loss reserve in Sand Canyon. So it's not all settled. Greg, can you share a little bit more about what occurred? Why wasn't it a complete settlement? It sounds very productive and good, but I just was just kind of curious why partial.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes. And just to clarify, I know you have this, Scott, but these are reserves for representation on warranty, not claims, not loan losses or such. But in the last quarter, third quarter of this fiscal year, Sand Canyon did enter into a specific settlement agreement with a counterparty, and that was fully reserved for in the reserve. The reserve itself moved down by $50 million, which was a fairly material number and was paid out during that quarter. So I think that's good progress. The reserve itself is also supported by other claimants that Sand Canyon's engaged in, having productive conversations. I know that many people would like to get better clarity in a timeline, but the reality is that these are still processed, and it just takes time, but our words continue to be consistent that there's forward progress being made here. The gain's just one resolved, I think, is an indication that there is progress.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nAnd then lastly, we're going slip it in. The bank, really not much discussed on this call, I don't know that you're going to share much more, but is there a level 2, deeper open question that you care to share with us at this point?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nOn the bank -- sort of the bank transaction?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, it's the transaction that we got with BofI is a good transaction for BofI. It's a good transaction for H&R Block. It's been with the regulator now for a year plus. We believe on the merits and the structure of the transaction will be approved. For us, we really just have to get it approved and implemented for next tax season. So we've got a fair amount of time to work with right now. Obviously, if we can get it approved well before that, that would be excellent and closed, but our position remains the same, that we think it will be approved. And it's really up to those regulators ultimately, though.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Schneeberger (Analysts)】\nAny increase, decrease in communication with the regulator? Anything that you would share outside or...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, both ourselves and BofI have regular conversations with the regulator in a normal course business. And of course, as we have appropriate questions come in, as it relates to this transaction, we would respond to those as thoroughly and as quickly as we can. We continue to be in a position where we're really just waiting for the most part at this point for a resolution, but there's been no change in the frequency or type of questions that we've seen in the last several months.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anjaneya Singh (Analysts)】\nJust a couple of quick questions. On the competitive dynamics touched upon earlier in your prepared remarks, and not being able to fill that hole on assisted versus the IRS filings, do you have a sense whether these filers have gone to other preparers? Are they going to DIY? Do you have a sense of where they're going to?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nWell, the overall assisted business, the latest numbers from the IRS is down 4.5% season to date. So obviously, the whole area of assisted is suffering. We're a little worse than that, but there seems to be assisted. Digital is about in line in terms of their growth rate with what we had talked about. I have reason to believe that the points I was making in my prepared remarks is that the EITC migration will get higher. Until Treasury implements the directive from Congress next year and the EITC filer on the DIY basis has a free lane, I think that point shift is going to go higher than 40 -- 42%. But we'll have to see how that plays out. So I think in that sense, yes, there would be a shift. I think overall, we think that the -- when the season is done, the assisted to digital shift will be more in line with what it's been the past couple of seasons, which is primarily due to this EITC issue.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anjaneya Singh (Analysts)】\nGot it. And I'm not sure if you touched upon this earlier, but I was wondering if you can comment on some of your strategies this season, enticing users of other preparers or software to switch to Block at half the cost or no cost. How does this fit with your strategy last year to a cut out low-margin filers? And what's the response been to these strategies this season?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nWell, let me take the assisted side, and then, Jason, if you want to speak to the promotion we've done with the DIY. I think we had a plan before we started the season that during the mid-February to mid-March timeframe, when we generally have available capacity, we wanted to be aggressive with trying to bring in new clients with our 50% off promotion. We're right in the middle of that right now. We'll see how that plays out, but that was a care -- a considered strategy really from a capacity basis, and in terms of trying to drive against picking up more clients. So that was the idea behind the assisted side. As far as DIY goes, Jason, why don't you talk about the overall integrated plan we put together?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nSure. Well, first, in desktop, we saw opportunity to give very dissatisfied TurboTax clients the opportunity to try our product. And by doing so, we felt like that they would recognize it's the best value in tax software. Really, we call this switch to block, which offer TurboTax clients, who send us a copy of their receipt, free H&R Block Deluxe software. Well, we're very pleased with the response of this, but more importantly, we're pleased with our desktop share performance in the early season. We estimate we've taken about 3 points in market share in desktop. And even though our results to-date in e-file is desktop up 5%, our unit sales are up much stronger than that. And again, this is a really nice high-value client and one that we are actively attracting.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anjaneya Singh (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And one for Greg. I just wanted to make sure. I wasn't clear on this. Are there more franchise purchases coming this year or have you bought all the ones that you're expecting to for 2015?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes, I think the vast majority of them we completed this season. There may be some small changes next year, but the material part of it was done in 2015 fiscal year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anjaneya Singh (Analysts)】\nGot it. And one final one. If you can answer it, I'd appreciate it. Just wondering, we saw the dates in the merger agreement and get revised further out. I believe it's now June 30. Wondering if there's any rhyme or reason as to how you choose those dates? Why isn't it May 30 or July 31?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nSo there is rhyme and there is reason, for sure. The answer is that we use those dates, I mean, of course, between BofI and ourselves to make sure that we're in agreement, but we've also used them as a way to help have a conversation with the regulators. So I wouldn't, from a broadest perspective, I wouldn't get too concerned about them. As you've already seen, we can, with BofI's agreement, move on as we need to. But we do think those are good timelines to work towards and helps us again have that conversation with the regulator.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nCan you tell us to what share of the ACA business you did or have done to date?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, Mike, I'm going to let this season play out before we get into anything like that. I don't think we -- I'm not even sure how we would get that number, but we'll obviously give you a full readout at the end of the season.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nI guess, what I was looking at is whether you're getting more than your average share of the total market.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nUnclear at this point. As I said, we are under the number that we anticipated for the early season. But beyond that, I wouldn't hazard a guess. So I think we'll have a better feel for that at the end of the season.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nWhat we do know, Mike, is that the average H&R Block client is twice as likely to be impacted by the ACA than the average American, simply because of the customer profile that we serve, is the people that this is really targeted towards. So ultimately, we're going to have more market share just because of that. But within that standard, the question really is going to be answered better at the end of the season, as Bill said.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nI mean, I think the one concern we have is, frankly, in the digital space. And do you want to talk about that Jason, specifically?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Houseworth (Executives)】\nSure. Well, I think it's important to point out that we actually don't have the same experience in our tax software. As a company, we feel it's critical to create and file an accurate tax return, and there's a big difference in how our tax software versus TurboTax works, specifically when you're talking about the Affordable Care Act. With H&R Block tax software, we require the filer to input his or her 1095-A in order to file. By contrast, TurboTax does not require this, which would mean that it may be easier to actually file the return using TurboTax, but the return is not going to be accurate. And in fact, it will actually put the return directly in the IRS special processing, which means that they're going to -- the taxpayer can file, they'll get an accepted return, but then they're going to get a mail, snail mail from the IRS, which will require 8 to 12 weeks of additional time and an amended return in order to then complete their return.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nWell, maybe you've just explained a question I was going to ask. It seems surprising that for the erroneous 1095s, that only less than 10% of them had already been filed by, I guess, mid-February.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Ciaramitaro (Executives)】\nSo this is Mark. This is -- Mike, this is a little bit different answer. What Jason was speaking to were people that enrolled in the marketplace and need to reconcile using a Form 8962, and those folks need to use a 1095-A. What you're speaking to is another issue that was recently announced by HHS that indicated that they had corrected 1095-As. In other words, the federal marketplace and some other state-based marketplaces, including California, had put out notices that indicated that the 1095s they had sent out were incorrect. And I think following that, HHS indicated that 90% to 95% of those folks hadn't yet filed. And so the vast majority of the folks that have to reconcile, which are virtually all of the people that enrolled in the marketplace last year, still have yet to file. That's -- I think that's the information there. But those folks are either going to have to amend their returns if they use their incorrect 1095-A or they're waiting to receive their corrected 1095-As. And that's, we think, contributing a little bit to the delays we're seeing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nI guess the question is you would've thought that they would be lower income, they would tend to file earlier than average?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Ciaramitaro (Executives)】\nWell, I think as Bill already mentioned in his comments, we originally thought that we would see a higher percentage of ACA-impacted clients, but it's turning out that we are probably going to see those clients spread throughout the tax season instead.\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, we -- I hate to sound the way that this is going to sound, we have to let this play out. But in consumer behavior, anytime you have a new service, a new initiative that was instituted by the government, you've got to wait and see how it plays out. That was our anticipation. It is not played out that way. We still believe with the form errors that Mark just talked about in general, that more ACA people will be coming in over the last 6 weeks.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nMaybe I missed something you said. Looking at the revenues, you're going to be up about 4x for returns that are not quite up that much. Am I missing some arithmetic here?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nAre you talking about the third quarter results, Mike?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nThird quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gregory Macfarlane (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, the third -- I think you have to be very careful looking at our third quarter financial results and extrapolating at this point. This was simply timing, e-file being open there in 11 days. We had a lot of returns last year that we had completed, but we weren't able to file them in because e-file was only open for one day in January last year. And even then, we had a limited number we could get in the door. So you do have that discrepancy. And so I really would be cautious in drawing too many conclusions from those comparisons.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Millman (Analysts)】\nI see. And then a question, over the last several years, we've seen, at least on IRS numbers, that assisted has either been flatfish up, almost de minimis increases. Where is this going in the future?\n\n---\n\n【回答: William Cobb (Executives)】\nWell, Mike, I mean, here's if -- this is why I'm spending an awful lot of time on this. If the government does not make moves to combat tax fraud, some of the things that we've done, that Jason outlined earlier, equalizing the standards on EITC, because that's been a significant shift, having competency exams and background checks and everything else on return preparers, I think assisted is going to struggle because it has really come to the forefront this year how bad the fraud is in this industry, and that's something we as -- and that's why I'm saying I'm glad to hear Commissioner Koskinen is going to convene a group. I think we, as industry leaders, have to come together to protect the American public, but there have to be some changes to -- these are huge numbers, and consumers are suffering for this, when they get a notice that their tax return has been filed and they haven't filed it yet.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Colby Brown (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Have a great day. We'll talk to you soon. Bye.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thanks, Victoria, and good morning, everyone. I want to thank you for joining us today for Brown-Forman's third quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are Paul Varga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Jane Morreau, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Fitzgerald, Chief Accounting Officer.\r\nThis morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements whether due to new information, future events or otherwise.\r\nThis morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The release can be found on our website under the section titled Investor Relations.\r\nIn the press release, we have listed a number of the risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K, Form 8-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\r\nDuring this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures and the reasons, management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release.\r\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Jane for her prepared remarks.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Jay, and thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. I'll cover 2 topics today, which should leave plenty of time for questions after our prepared remarks. First, I'll review our year-to-date results, including trends in the third quarter; and second, I'll discuss our updated outlook for 2015.\r\nSo let me start by reviewing our recent results. Third quarter underlying net sales growth of over 5% is particularly impressive in light of the strong 8% underlying growth we delivered in the third quarter of last year and against the competitive set that is showing little-to-no growth. Year-to-date underlying sales are also up 5% with price/mix contributing 3 points of sales growth.\r\nTop line results in the United States continued to accelerate in the quarter, up 7% year-to-date compared to 5% through the first half. Market share gains in the U.S. are being driven by the great work our teams and partners are doing to capitalize on the renewed consumer interest in authentic American whiskeys, including the Jack Daniel's family, Woodford Reserve and Old Forester.\r\nPremiumization trends and innovation have played key roles in driving our outperformance over the last few years, and we look to introduce new expressions over time that we believe can help us deliver sustainable long-term growth.\r\nDeveloped markets outside the United States grew underlying net sales 4% during the first 9 months. France, the United Kingdom and Canada are all growing quite well, while Germany and Italy were up slightly. These markets helped offset sluggish results in Australia and Japan and in Spain, where results were down double-digits.\r\nAnd in the emerging markets, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey continues to grow mid-teens, driven by strength in Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, Brazil, Indonesia, the Philippines and sub-Sahara Africa. Mexico results were flat as the mainstream tequila category remains quite competitive, and we are actively repositioning our el Jimador brand at a higher price point. Additionally, large declines in Poland, driven by Finlandia, pulled down our total emerging market growth to 6% in the first 9 months. Remember, Poland had large buy-ins in advance of last year's January 1 excise tax increase, so comparisons were challenging in calendar 2014. Excluding Poland, our emerging market sales growth would have been 7 points higher.\r\nFurthermore, we estimate that year-to-date underlying net sales growth for the entire company, excluding Poland, would have been a point higher at 6.5%.\r\nLet's now move to the reconciliation of reported to underlying results. In appreciating U.S. dollar continued to weigh heavily on our reported results. Last quarter, I used the euro as an example, stating that it had declined 7% since our first quarter call. These declines continued in our third quarter as the euro dropped another 9%. In total, we experienced additional FX headwinds of approximately $0.04 in the third quarter, beyond our expectations at the time of our second quarter call.\r\nSo while our top line grew 5% on an underlying basis during the first 9 months of fiscal 2015, foreign exchange negatively impacted our reported results by approximately 3 percentage points. In incremental -- an increase in estimated net distributor inventories helped reported results by 1 percentage point due to our route-to-consumer change in France.\r\nAs a reminder, our former distributor fully depleted inventories of our brands during November and December of last fiscal year, leading to essentially no shipments in the third quarter of 2014 in France, which negatively impacted our reported results last year. The absence of these reductions this year resulted in a favorable onetime comparison. This benefit, combined with the negative effect of foreign exchange, resulted in reported net sales growth of 3% over the 9-month period.\r\nUnderlying A&P spend increased 4% while underlying SG&A grew 9%. Both line items were a few points lower on a reported basis as foreign exchange helped our non-U.S. dollar denominated cost. Year-to-date SG&A increases have been driven in part by a route-to-market investment in France, but we expect lower full year SG&A growth.\r\nPutting this all together, we delivered 7% year-to-date growth in underlying operating income. Foreign exchange headwinds hurt our reported operating income growth by 7 points. This was due to transactional impact on net exposures and the revaluation of net current asset denominated in foreign currencies. The revaluations are captured in the $22 million negative swing in the other income and expense line item on the P&L.\r\nFor the first 9 months of the year, earnings per share came in at $2.54, up 4% year-over-year. Foreign exchange was an $0.18 drag on reported EPS. So year-over-year growth in EPS would have been approximately 11%, excluding this impact.\r\nMoving now to my second and final topic, an update on our outlook for fiscal 2015. Today, we are reaffirming the ranges we shared with you for our full year outlook for underlying net sales growth of 6% to 8%. Our year-to-date top line results are running slightly below the low end of this range due largely to comparison issues with the prior year. Our business momentum remains robust, and we will be comping against last year's soft fourth quarter underlying sales growth of 3%, which was negatively impacted by give-back in Poland.\r\nSo with 2-year stacks sales growth running 14% in the third quarter and the expectation of easier comparisons, we anticipate strong fourth quarter top line growth to pull our full year sales growth back in the 6% to 8% range.\r\nRegarding the national launch of the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, our teams have been hard at work, and we recently began shipping our first cases to the other 42 states. Our initial read-through from our 8 test states has been very encouraging, with Fire continuing to index quite favorably to Honey's introduction 4 years ago. And we believe that the limited rollout has helped fuel consumer interest in the brand.\r\nEqually important, we believe that Fire is not only complementing Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, but is showing little sign of slowing the rate of growth for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey in the initial test market. From an earnings perspective, we expect a few cents of benefit to fiscal 2015's reported results, reflecting pipeline build.\r\nYear-to-date gross margin expansion of 70 basis points has been stronger than what we expect for the full year given our expectations for higher costs in the fourth quarter related to wood for our barrel-making operation caused by growing an increased interest for bourbon.\r\nUnderlying SG&A growth moderated to 6% in the third quarter as we began to lap the route-to-market change in France on January 1. We anticipate additional moderation in the fourth quarter as we lap last year's 14% growth rate. In the aggregate, we expect underlying operating income growth in the fourth quarter in the teens, which should result in full year underlying operating income growth of 9% to 11%.\r\nNot surprisingly, FX remains a headwind. So given today's spot rates, which, for reference, are roughly 13% weaker than 35-year average versus the dollar, we expect foreign exchange to pull down our reported EPS in the fourth quarter. We anticipate FX will hurt our full year operating income by over $60 million and EPS by over $0.20, assuming today's spot rates.\r\nThis year, full year FX impact is $0.05 worse than we expected at the time of our second quarter call and a driver for our revised EPS range of $3.15 to $3.25.\r\nAs a sensitivity, assuming our foreign exchange cash flow exposures collectively move 10% in either direction, our EPS over the balance of the year would be impacted by approximately $0.04. And while it's too early in our planning process this year's specific guidance on fiscal 2010 -- '16, we remain optimistic about our prospects for a continued growth giving the health of our existing business continued category momentum and our disciplined innovation strategy. We'll share more specifics with you on our fourth quarter call.\r\nSo in closing, we continue to deliver strong underlying growth. We attribute this outperformance to our leading portfolio of American whiskey brands, led by the Jack Daniel's trademark, strong and growing geographic diversification and premiumization opportunities for our portfolio of brands. Our business model has been built around premium brands and efficiencies inherent in single point production, leading to high gross margins and strong free cash flow.\r\nWe approach our capital deployment with a very long-term view, supported by the health and strength of our balance sheet. This allows us to simultaneously invest in future growth, as we are actively doing today behind Jack Daniel's and our other American whiskey brands, evaluate potential acquisitions and return cash to our shareholders as we have done to the tune of almost $0.5 billion so far this fiscal year through ongoing dividend and share buyback programs.\r\nSo let me turn the call over now to Paul for his comments. Paul?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. First, let me say that I continue to be pleased with the company's results, and I want to publicly thank my Brown-Forman colleagues worldwide for again producing them. I think we had another very good quarter of underlying performance, and I would highlight that our 5% sales growth and 8% operating income growth on an underlying basis came on top of a very strong Q3 last year. So with the expectation that we will finish the year along the lines of what we've guided today, I believe we will have recorded another excellent year of underlying growth and business progress at the company.\r\nOne of the things that makes our underlying results stand out in my view is that they compare quite favorably to those we observe across our industry. And this has been a consistent reality over the last many years. One of the reasons for our differential underlying performance, I believe, is that Brown-Forman is uniquely well positioned through our American whiskey leadership and our ownership of the Jack Daniel's brand, which itself gives us superb geographic breadth, diversification and continuing opportunity.\r\nIn our communications with you over the years, we've discussed an aspect of American whiskey that I believe is particularly unique. It is simultaneously enjoying the desirable attributes of both mixability and premiumization. Most often in distilled spirit categories, these 2 dimensions are observed as mutually exclusive.\r\nIf you consider the 2 largest multi-country categories in the spirits industry by volume, and that's scotch and vodka, this point is made rather clearly. Within scotch, we frequently see leading trademarks positioned very successfully at many price points, spanning from standard to luxury. In each case, utilizing the same trademark name at each of the price points. Within vodka, the leading trademarks have not exhibited the same vertical agility. The leading brand at each successive price tranche in vodka typically carry a different brand name.\r\nBy contrast, however, vodka has shown tremendous horizontal agility, if you will, through flavored vodkas and premixed RTDs, which provide consumers with a broad range of flavor options for the consuming occasion. Scotch, on the other hand, has had little success expanding their trademarks along the same flavor or mixability dimension.\r\nBut uniquely within American whiskey, and best evidenced by our own Jack Daniel's, the category's brands have shown the ability to be successful along both of these attractive dimensions within the same trademark. Let me give you an example of this. On the mixability and flavor front, Jack Daniel's has enjoyed today in a more varied fashion than scotch whiskey competition through everyday mixed drinks like Jack and Coke, premium convenience offerings like Jack Daniel's RTDs and propriety flavor whiskey expressions like Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and our new Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, which is currently rolling out in the United States. At the same time that Jack Daniel's enjoyed this consumption variety through its inherent mixability, the brand's reputation for crafting the finest American whiskey is evidenced through the success of brands like Gentleman Jack and Jack Daniel's Single Barrel, 2 trademark expressions that have become sizable brands in the ultra-premium American whiskey segment. In fact, these 2 brands figure prominently in a milestone Brown-Forman celebrated during our most recent quarter. For the first time, the combined 12-month volumes of Gentleman Jack, Jack Daniel's Single Barrel and Woodford Reserve eclipsed 1 million cases.\r\nBeyond being our company's shining illustration of premiumization within American whiskey, these brands also represent a very valuable ultra-premium whiskey business for Brown-Forman today, given their attractive profitability, returns and growth rates.\r\nNow as nice as this 1 million case milestone is to recognize, just as exciting is the fact that the ultra-premium-plus price segment of American whiskey, is still at a very early stage of development. Contrasting this price segment of American whiskey to the equivalent one in scotch whiskey, we observed that this highest end represents only 2% to 3% of total American whiskey retail dollars, whereas the same price segment accounts for over 30% of total scotch. So on a share of category basis alone, there's a 10 to fifteenfold opportunity for the highest end of American whiskey if it can develop as ultra-premium scotch has.\r\nAnd to reinforce the point in a different way, in pure retail dollar terms, because scotch is so much larger than American whiskey, the highest end of scotch today represents the segment there's more than 35x the size of the American whiskey equivalent. Any way we view the data, we see this as an enormous long-term opportunity for Brown-Forman within the category that is most important to us and that we know best.\r\nSo the brand-building capabilities are people have demonstrated in achieving this first 1 million case milestone will be the enabling factor as we strive for the next 1 million cases. And while my focus today has been on this 1 particular ultra-premium whiskey achievement, we also intend to apply these same capabilities to the significant opportunities we envision for other premium-plus brands such as Herradura, Sonoma-Cutrer and Old Forester to name just a few.\r\nThe highest priority for our time and capabilities, however, will remain the responsible globalization and development of the Jack Daniel's Black Label brand as we continue to build its mixability and premiums. Jack Daniel's Black Label is the foundation of the Jack Daniel's trademark overall as well as Brown-Forman's most meaningful growth opportunity for the foreseeable future.\r\nThis concludes our prepared commentary this morning, and we're now happy to take any questions you might have.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Jason Koval (Executives)】\nThanks, Victoria, and good morning, everyone. I want to thank you for joining us today for Brown-Forman's third quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are Paul Varga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Jane Morreau, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Fitzgerald, Chief Accounting Officer.\r\nThis morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements whether due to new information, future events or otherwise.\r\nThis morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The release can be found on our website under the section titled Investor Relations.\r\nIn the press release, we have listed a number of the risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K, Form 8-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\r\nDuring this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures and the reasons, management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release.\r\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Jane for her prepared remarks.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nThanks, Jay, and thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. I'll cover 2 topics today, which should leave plenty of time for questions after our prepared remarks. First, I'll review our year-to-date results, including trends in the third quarter; and second, I'll discuss our updated outlook for 2015.\r\nSo let me start by reviewing our recent results. Third quarter underlying net sales growth of over 5% is particularly impressive in light of the strong 8% underlying growth we delivered in the third quarter of last year and against the competitive set that is showing little-to-no growth. Year-to-date underlying sales are also up 5% with price/mix contributing 3 points of sales growth.\r\nTop line results in the United States continued to accelerate in the quarter, up 7% year-to-date compared to 5% through the first half. Market share gains in the U.S. are being driven by the great work our teams and partners are doing to capitalize on the renewed consumer interest in authentic American whiskeys, including the Jack Daniel's family, Woodford Reserve and Old Forester.\r\nPremiumization trends and innovation have played key roles in driving our outperformance over the last few years, and we look to introduce new expressions over time that we believe can help us deliver sustainable long-term growth.\r\nDeveloped markets outside the United States grew underlying net sales 4% during the first 9 months. France, the United Kingdom and Canada are all growing quite well, while Germany and Italy were up slightly. These markets helped offset sluggish results in Australia and Japan and in Spain, where results were down double-digits.\r\nAnd in the emerging markets, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey continues to grow mid-teens, driven by strength in Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, Brazil, Indonesia, the Philippines and sub-Sahara Africa. Mexico results were flat as the mainstream tequila category remains quite competitive, and we are actively repositioning our el Jimador brand at a higher price point. Additionally, large declines in Poland, driven by Finlandia, pulled down our total emerging market growth to 6% in the first 9 months. Remember, Poland had large buy-ins in advance of last year's January 1 excise tax increase, so comparisons were challenging in calendar 2014. Excluding Poland, our emerging market sales growth would have been 7 points higher.\r\nFurthermore, we estimate that year-to-date underlying net sales growth for the entire company, excluding Poland, would have been a point higher at 6.5%.\r\nLet's now move to the reconciliation of reported to underlying results. In appreciating U.S. dollar continued to weigh heavily on our reported results. Last quarter, I used the euro as an example, stating that it had declined 7% since our first quarter call. These declines continued in our third quarter as the euro dropped another 9%. In total, we experienced additional FX headwinds of approximately $0.04 in the third quarter, beyond our expectations at the time of our second quarter call.\r\nSo while our top line grew 5% on an underlying basis during the first 9 months of fiscal 2015, foreign exchange negatively impacted our reported results by approximately 3 percentage points. In incremental -- an increase in estimated net distributor inventories helped reported results by 1 percentage point due to our route-to-consumer change in France.\r\nAs a reminder, our former distributor fully depleted inventories of our brands during November and December of last fiscal year, leading to essentially no shipments in the third quarter of 2014 in France, which negatively impacted our reported results last year. The absence of these reductions this year resulted in a favorable onetime comparison. This benefit, combined with the negative effect of foreign exchange, resulted in reported net sales growth of 3% over the 9-month period.\r\nUnderlying A&P spend increased 4% while underlying SG&A grew 9%. Both line items were a few points lower on a reported basis as foreign exchange helped our non-U.S. dollar denominated cost. Year-to-date SG&A increases have been driven in part by a route-to-market investment in France, but we expect lower full year SG&A growth.\r\nPutting this all together, we delivered 7% year-to-date growth in underlying operating income. Foreign exchange headwinds hurt our reported operating income growth by 7 points. This was due to transactional impact on net exposures and the revaluation of net current asset denominated in foreign currencies. The revaluations are captured in the $22 million negative swing in the other income and expense line item on the P&L.\r\nFor the first 9 months of the year, earnings per share came in at $2.54, up 4% year-over-year. Foreign exchange was an $0.18 drag on reported EPS. So year-over-year growth in EPS would have been approximately 11%, excluding this impact.\r\nMoving now to my second and final topic, an update on our outlook for fiscal 2015.

      "transcript_text3": "So my first question has to do with the depletion trends in the quarter. It looks like they slowed a little bit, but I see that that's on a tough comp. So could you dive in a little bit more in terms of the depletion trends specifically for 3Q, please?\n\n---\n\nYes, Vivien. I think the way I would look at that, if you looked at our first quarter trends, I think they're a little bit soft, though, you're right. Q2 was a little bit stronger, and Q3 is a little bit down versus Q2. But I think it's all relative to last year. So really, if you look at where we were through the first half, we're at 2%. We're still at 2%. So I don't really see a slowdown. I think it's really -- can't really look at 1 quarter in isolation, if you will. In fact, I see improving trends, particularly in the U.S. we experience some nice acceleration there. So I think a lot of what you're seeing is simply a difficult comp that I was referring to in my script and we also alluded to in our earnings release as it related to some buy-ins last year in Poland. But we don't -- we are not seeing it -- I don't view it as a slowdown. You're going to see these one-off things happening when you look at quarter-to-quarter.\n\n---\n\nThat's very helpful. Jane, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that Fire continues to track well relative to Tennessee Honey. At your Investor Day, you indicated it was about 1.35x. Can you give us a little bit more detail on how the trajectory has evolved as you've kind of included 5 more states in this comparison?\n\n---\n\nYes, so just to reiterate how encouraged we are about what we are seeing and how excited our people are, the trade is and the consumer are wanting and excited about seeing a super-premium cinnamon brand expression from Jack Daniel's. So you're right, we did talk about the early test market back in -- at our investor conference. We are not seeing a slowing. We continue to see somewhere in the 130% to 140% indexing. So we've not seen it slow down, if you will. It's maintained and we're very encouraged by that. With that being said, these are unchartered waters for us a bit, given it is a higher price offering versus what the category price point -- that already exists. But nonetheless, we're very excited. We just started shipping our first cases out a couple of weeks ago to the remaining 42 states, as I said earlier. So time will tell, but we're very -- I think we're very positioned well for that.\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, the trade reaction so far is -- I mean if anything, because there was some pent-up demand. I'd say the national rollout has been received with as much or even more enthusiasm as the original sort of test markets were. And the thing that's so interesting when you go national is you have the ability to use things like media, the ability for social media to help you -- I mean this brand -- I would give you one sort of I thought -- that I thought was an interesting thing I heard in the last month on this that the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire Twitter followers have already eclipsed the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey followers. And so while it's too early to know how the actual consumer acceptance in terms of real purchases in the marketplace will unfold, what we've seen so far, both at trade and consumer, on this is really encouraging.\n\n---\n\nThat's very good news. My last question just in terms of the acceleration that you're seeing in the United States, can you talk about the balance between on- and off-premise? I think you guys pointed to some improving trends on-premise last quarter, so I'm curious if that's continued.\n\n---\n\nYes, I can talk a little bit and Paul can chime in. I think the latest NABCA information through January indicated that the on-premise trends are continuing to accelerate, both overall spirits is up and Brown-Forman were beating the overall spirits. So Jack Daniel's itself continues to improve as well. I think we're up about 2% in the on-premise. It's up 1 point -- about 0.5 point over the prior month. So we continuously, since about last March or April, have seen a continued improvement in overall trends in the on-premise and this has impacted favorably our brands. I will say when I look at our brands, Old Forester is our fastest-growing on-premise brand by a long shot. But we've got a lot of other brands that are growing quite nicely in the on-premise, too, Woodford Reserve, el Jimador. They're growing very, very strongly. Gentleman Jack is doing well. So the trends are improving. We'll see what kind of weather you guys are predicting there today, but we're predicting more snow here today. So remember last year, the winter was quite bad and I know the month of February has been dicey around the states -- United States. So -- but we think we got a couple more months of soft comps, depending again how the weather goes over the next couple of months.\n\n---\n\nAnd of course U.S. comment -- I mean, we don't have as great a visibility and timeliness on international on-premise. But it's been our experience here, as with the places where these economies have been difficult to be on-premise along with some of the off-premise has continued to show some weakness. But I would say that even though the on-premise -- I mean, the strength particularly of this U.S. off-premise environment as spirit brands, and I'll say premium spirit brands, are very much affordable luxuries still. And so if you just compare per drink outlaid by the consumer for either a bottle of Jack Daniel's or Woodford Reserve compared too many other entertainment alternatives stacks up quite nice. I think the off-premise continues to really drive in the U.S. market. And not to diminish the impact of recovering on-premise, but I mean, at least our read of the last 12 months of U.S. distilled spirit sales, driven in great in part by our core category, bourbon and American whiskey, has upticked a little bit.\n\n---\n\nI apologize, I got a little confused in terms of the impact in France vis-à-vis the impact in Poland. Were they similar impacts with all of that in the most recent quarter? Is that the way we should look at that? And so that's more of a housekeeping question. And then sort of a longer-term question, Paul, you talked about sort of being single sourced and that's been a huge advantage for you, allows you guys to build scale, what have you. But U.S.-based manufacturing costs could provide a little bit of pressure over the next several years if we continue to see strength in the dollar. So can you talk a little bit about how you guys are looking at that? If we do have a stronger dollar longer-term, what you can do in place to offset some of the transactional FX impacts that you guys are expecting.\n\n---\n\nSure, I'll tackle that, while Jane considers your first question here. Yes, I mean, these are always trade-offs to be a single point producer in the United States at the time of the strengthening dollar. Yes, I mean, there's all these trends. I would tell you, it's better to be positioned at the very high end of a market versus the low end when that's happening because proportionately, the FX impact is less so -- on your profits. And so I feel like net-net, when you balance it all out, the efficiencies -- and we've been well served over these years by the single point production and efficiency. And frankly, also that just the importance of that home place and the imported status that's conferred to Jack Daniel's as an imported American whiskey when it leaves the shores of the United States have all been very important to the brand's development over the years. So I think there's both efficiency reasons that you asked questions, also some marketing ones. I do think there are things that are implied, in some ways even more indirectly than directly, as the dollar strengthens. I mean, I think the most significant is that, at least the way I think about it, there might be a big rationalization here. But if you think about why the U.S. dollar has been strengthening, one of the contributing factors is the strength of the U.S. economy and -- relative to other countries. And the way I look at it, we happen to have the good fortune of having -- as a largest country. It's the most valuable distilled spirits market in the world. It's our home country, which we know very well. And it also happens within our industry to be one of the most exciting times for our core categories. So I know this might be a very simplistic way of thinking, but the way I think about it is, as it relates to things, everything from resource allocation or innovation or the way that we think about developing our business at the time when the U.S. dollar is strong is make sure you're maximizing the opportunities available to you in the United States market is one thing. And so that's one of the ways in this past year we certainly have upped our investment behind Jack Daniel's. You heard us talk about the introduction here of Tennessee Fire, which is an innovative effort. You've -- I mean, empathize very strongly here the ultra-premium whiskeys, which have the predominant presence for them. The largest markets in each one of those cases is the United States. So I think it's a reminder to all of us as Brown-Forman's managers to really make sure you're doing the best possible job you can in the markets to be attractive, it is in some ways causing the dollar to strengthen. So -- and that's different than -- I mean, it's certainly, sure, a U.S.-based company is a wonderful time to either be making acquisitions in Europe or to be borrowing in European denominations, those kinds of things. But those alone aren't reasons to go do it. They're just -- they increased, I think, the benefits of time and as you think about it. But I think the biggest takeaway is for us to make sure we're doing the best possible job in the United States.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I'll follow-up on your housekeeping question. Let's see, I see France and Poland as 2 different things. The reason why we illustrated France for you was because it impacted our third quarter only reported results, so when we're providing a reconciliation, understanding between reported and underlying. So it's the reported aspect. Poland, on the other hand, has been something that has hurt us all 2014, following the excessive or huge significant tax increase taken last Jan 1. And as a result of that, it's been a market that has impacted our comparisons all year long. And we do expect easier comps as we go into the fourth quarter. That has impact on our underlying results, and that's why I isolated Poland as it related to our discussion. I hope that helps.\n\n---\n\nThat does. But does that mean that the impact -- would the impact in Q3 the same -- do they offset each other generally? In understanding the differences between the situations, was there a rough offset between the 2 countries in the third quarter specifically?\n\n---\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\nAnd again, one was on a reported basis and one is underlying. France did not impact the underlying results. It's not reported. Poland...\n\n---\n\nYes. And the impact in France that we've highlighted, I think, if I got it right, would be larger than the direct impact that you were citing for the underlying in Poland, don't you think? I think as it relates to -- even though one is an underlying, one is in the reported, but there was a significant -- it was, what, in terms of estimated net change in distributor inventories is a 6-point quarterly impact on France. And I don't know, did Poland impact 6 points at the underlying?\n\n---\n\nWell, it impacted my emerging markets.\n\n---\n\nEmerging markets, yes, but not the corporation. Yes.\n\n---\n\nJust following up on Poland. I guess I'm curious to hear more about the underlying trends. I think, Jane, you had talked about last quarter where obviously the shipment numbers that you've been reporting has been impacted by the inventory movement, but the underlying trends were starting to improve. So I just wanted to understand if that's continuing in the back half of the year. And then as it relates to the fourth quarter sales guidance, obviously, you're expecting pretty sizable acceleration. The comps are easier. But just in terms of thinking about some of the underlying trends, are you expecting any sizable improvement in some of the markets? It sounds like maybe Tennessee Fire is adding about a couple of points to sales in terms of pipe sales. So can you just verify that number? And is there any inventory movement that we should be thinking about as it relates to the fourth quarter?\n\n---\n\nA lot there, Judy.\n\n---\n\nI mean, I'll talk about...\n\n---\n\nLet me to talk about Poland.\n\n---\n\nYes, are you ready on Poland? Because I could answer the last one if you want me to.\n\n---\n\nYes, I can start on Poland. And what we are seeing there and continue to see, as it relates to the premium whiskey in the Polish market as well as Jack Daniel's from an underlying takeaway trend perspective, we see accelerating results, so another -- I'll just give you one example. The premium whiskey is growing 33% in Poland market on a 3-month basis, up from 25% on a 12-month. So similarly, Black Label is growing 13% on a 3-month, up 9% on a 12-month, so you can see the acceleration there. And again, the excise tax or the comparisons impacted the difficult comps that we've been talking about all along impacted both Jack Daniel's Black Label and Finlandia. So neither brand has been growing at the takeaway trend rates that I'm showing here. The takeaway trends for Finlandia are much better than what we're seeing in our current results as well. So 12-month trends are running 3%, and we're down right now year-over-year again. So that gives you a little bit of flavor that the takeaway trends the consumer has taken is working its way through all the inventory and the adjustments from the excise tax a year ago. So did that help on Poland?\n\n---\n\nYes. And are we done with all the inventory destocking that needed to get cleaned out?\n\n---\n\nOn Poland? Yes, it will be. Yes, that's behind us.\n\n---\n\nFor the purposes of comparison, we hope there's no more excise tax increase. But now, yes, you'll always have the trading pace. But as it relates to what we're guiding today, yes. And Judy, I think the other question you have there was what are the components that give us the confidence, and you cited that all of them -- I'll just comment in a general way. The biggest thing are the soft comps that relate to, for example, Poland and in Europe that we feel that are -- were in Q4 last year that we do expect and would, as part of our guidance, the United States to continue to accelerate along the lines of what we've been seeing, so the industry and the category but also our business has been accelerating. So it's with that expectation that, that will continue through the fourth quarter. And we think we got the right sort of, I think, investments and programming and system effort around that to accomplish what we want. And then you mentioned the other one, which is Tennessee Fire. And then Tennessee Fire, in addition, which is this a U.S. comment, its introduction to the United States on a national level is the other contributing factor that we would be incorporating into that acceleration. So those are the main 3 components that the soft comp U.S. acceleration with some Tennessee Fire on top of it. Now you also asked would that create any inventory things, and the only inventory things, that I think Jane might have highlighted a little bit, would be on Tennessee Fire pipeline because you will ship some in a course -- at a national launch in advance of the depletions, and so there might be a little there. But otherwise, we're expecting inventories to largely be in balance at the end of the year.\n\n---\n\nNo different really from where we are.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So just to clarify on Fire, because you had called out few cents of EPS spend as it related to pipe sale in the fourth quarter, so I guess that implies roughly 1.5 to 2 points of sales impact that potentially would come...\n\n---\n\nOn a reported basis.\n\n---\n\nOn a reported basis. Okay. But that's not included in your underlying sales growth guidance?\n\n---\n\nThe impact on our underlying full year impact is less than 1 point -- less than 0.5 point as I recall.\n\n---\n\nWe're investing back behind the Fire launch.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then, Jane, just lastly on FX. I know we'll get obviously full year guidance for next year when you report next quarter, and FX continues to be a moving target. But if I just sort of take where the spot prices are today, I get to another $0.15 or so of negative FX. I just wanted to understand if there's anything missing in terms of hedging exposure or transaction that I'm missing as I calculate the impact as of today.\n\n---\n\nThe only thing that I would say is, as I've been trying to explain as we talk the last 2 quarters about transactional and translational FX, so the transactional being attributable to our translating our foreign-denominated net current assets back to the U.S. dollars. Assuming the spot rates stay where they are today, we had a pretty significant impact. I talked about, I think its $22 million, $23 million that's showing up in our other income and expense line item, I would consider that onetime in nature, if you will, if the spot rates stay where they are. So that would not repeat itself next year, if you're thinking about hits of FX from this year. So that would come -- be a favorable comparison, if you will, next year. That's the only thing right now I would say. It's just in terms of how we hedge, and I think we've discussed that before in our hedging philosophy and how we roll in our hedges actually over time.\n\n---\n\nJust, Jane, just 2 quick questions relative to the quarter. One, I think you said that underlying SG&A was up 6% in the quarter. Did you give us what underlying advertising was up or down in the quarter?\n\n---\n\n4% in this quarter, I believe. Hold on, let me double check that. I'm sorry. It was up 4% in the quarter.\n\n---\n\nUp 4%.\n\n---\n\n3%.\n\n---\n\n3%, I'm sorry.\n\n---\n\nWas up 3% for year-to-date.\n\n---\n\n3% for year-to-date, yes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then second question, just -- I seemed to recall from the last -- from the Q2 earnings call that underlying sales growth was 7% and the expectation was that -- it had accelerated to 7% and it wouldn't move from that. So I'm just trying to understand was the third quarter a little bit light relative to what you're expecting? Or was that comment about you don't expect to get -- you'd expect to hold or get better or more of a comment of what you were thinking over the second half instead of specifically the third quarter.\n\n---\n\nYes, actually, Bryan, that's a great question. And what we were referring -- what we said was the back half not -- we weren't giving quarterly guidance, so we were saying we were expecting the back half to not -- to go down, if you will, or to change. So well, I think the third quarter was largely in line with what we expected. We knew we were going to have difficult top line comparisons the last year where we had a really strong third quarter growing top line 8%. So our comment was more as it related to the back half.\n\n---\n\nYes. Overall, I think it sort of met our expectations. I mean, you can always expect a few of the places around the world would have -- we would have hoped for more, but actually I think the U.S. actually surprised us on the upside a little bit from my point of view. So -- but I think we're sticking to what we basically said back in the Q2 call as it relates to the back half.\n\n---\n\nJust skipping from kind of the macro negative of FX to what seemed to me to be a couple of meaningful macro positive, gas prices in Travel Retail. Can you talk about -- I mean, I do recall hearing those as negatives on the way up. Are you starting to see benefits in perhaps on-premise or Travel Retail segment?\n\n---\n\nYes. So we have discussed a little bit earlier mainly it was all around the U.S., but we do continue to see on-premise trends for our brands continuing, growing in the low single digits so -- overall. We do think there has been, if you look back and when the acceleration began, there seems to be a correlation between when gas prices started going down. So perhaps having a few extra pennies in their pockets to buy this affordable luxury, if you will. As it relates to Travel Retail business, we've actually had mixed results there. I think we're seeing parts of the world doing very well, but places over in Europe, largely around Russia, our European operations because of the disruption going on in that part of the world and the number of consumers from Russia, actually, is a large percentage that actually purchased in the European market has been a little bit lighter than we would have hoped for. And so -- but we have seen some good -- in certain parts -- certain travel retail markets around the world. And I hope that's due to gas prices and more affordable. But it's hard to say, tell you, with FX and who -- where people are coming from and how that may be way more than offsetting gas prices other than the consumers in the U.S., I think is probably a larger trend to pay attention to.\n\n---\n\nYes, as it relates to the U.S. market, I don't -- I mean I don't have any specific data on this, but I do know anecdotally that we might even have stronger on-premise U.S. numbers if -- particularly European tourism wasn't being hit by the strong dollar. I mean, I feel -- we've heard restaurants and we know from hotels and places like that, that they're not as buoyant as they were 6 or 8 months ago. So I mean, those are -- all these things have offsets to each other as you go around the world for Brown-Forman. It's one of the benefits that we accrue for having such nice geographic diversity. But I think net-net for our business around the world, the low gas prices are help net-net, and of course they should be help -- particularly if they stay down for quite some time, they would be a help to you, you'd expect, like fuel cost and energy and things like that. They will make their way in. And -- but on the flip side, what ends up happening is for a company like us, you end up having negative foreign exchange impact with. So -- and these things offset each other in some ways partially or not. But I will say this, we do spend some time looking at what foreign exchange rate indices look like. And I mean, I would note that I think that the last time we looked at it, the current index is the dollar is stronger than its sort of 20-year average, and it always fluctuates above and below that average, of course. But this would be a particular time of strength. So for those who are thinking about how much more will this run or how long, if you believe history at all, the U.S. dollar is at a stronger point than its historical index would indicate.\n\n---\n\nTwo questions. Firstly, within the emerging markets, the commentary on Russia actually, it is more positive. Now I remember you had some specific issues in Russia. Are they all now resolved now? And the second question was around the Investor Day in December, you did talk quite a bit about scotch and Irish whiskey being attractive categories to go into. Is there any update you can provide us on that at this stage?\n\n---\n\nI can talk about Russia real quick. We are pleased with Russia in terms of the tone, and doing pretty well there. We had a net sales growth of around 6%, I think, year-to-date through 9 months. Of course it's being hurt by the devaluation of the ruble. But specifically, as it relates to our ability to sell our products and reach the consumers and have things been up there, if you will, we're very encouraged by what we've seen. And so like, we're able to sell our product in the marketplace at this point in time.\n\n---\n\nYes, Ian. And I think you are correct in your recall of our interest, particularly I'd say in the -- at the ultra-premium, the super-premium-plus segments of those particular categories. I mean, no real news to update you on other to say that we remain as excited about that as we study those marketplaces and the continuing development of them. I mean, it's only been a couple of months since we you saw in December so -- I would say this, the only thing that might change is for a U.S.-based company if you can find attractive properties, and either one of those, it's even more attractive because of the currency as I mentioned. And you could tell probably from my initial comments that we really think -- I highlighted American whiskey, but we really think the premium end of whiskey is a very attractive place to play. I mean amongst the most that you can really kind of -- to be quite honest with you, not only within our industry, I just think it's enormously attractive and valuable business when you contrast it to many other industry. So you want to find the most attractive and advisable investments you can make there. So we are scanning that as we -- as you would expect us to.\n\n---\n\nSo just going back in Russia because there was some sort of a boycott there by -- has it all gone away, if I recall it correctly?\n\n---\n\nA boycott on our products? Is that what you're saying?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nWe had some administrative labeling things in a particular region of Russia that temporarily disrupted our sales into accounts there on Tennessee Honey. And it was just -- so it was a very small part of Brown-Forman's total Russia business. And there's been some, I think, generally positive administrative development on that front. So I would say things as it relates to probably the larger question on Russia for us is just the impact of all of this on their economy more so than what we would declare as any kind of administrative problems or trade restrictions, those kinds of things. Truly right now more the impact on the economy.\n\n---\n\nThis is actually Stephanie, in for Bill. My question has to do with advertising and if you could provide either on a reported or underlying perspective more details on what you expect next quarter, particularly with the launch of Tennessee Fire. And then just kind of going off of that, what do you expect in terms of kind of -- or what you're seeing with your competitive -- your competitors in terms of what they're doing for advertising?\n\n---\n\nOkay. So we are spending -- we're, as you know, we're at 4% year-to-date underlying increase in net sales. We are going to expand to launch the brand quite nicely in the fourth quarter. So I would expect that number to tick up a little bit, up from where we are on a year-to-date basis. So by the end of the year, the number will be more than 4%. I hope that answers that question. And then your other question around competitors and I -- we're not -- I can't really answer all the questions there in terms of what they're doing. They definitely vary by market, varies by brand.\n\n---\n\nI looked at a weighted average of our competition. We sometimes do try to study the difference between maybe their sales growth rate and their operating income growth rate as a guide. It looks to me like they -- because they're -- most of the industry when you look at it is growing a very low organic growth rate. And then when you translate, at least the way they're guiding as an operating income or EBITDA growth rate, it might just be a little bit higher. So that it would appear to me that somewhere, I can't be specific to advertising, but somewhere between advertising and SG&A investment, they might be getting 1 point or maybe 0.2 of leverage from whatever they have reported or whatever they're guiding on sales. So a little bit of leverage, but I can't imagine that people are in very strong investment mode or else it will be showing up with a diminishment to operating income versus an increase. And so if you think about us, I mean, our fiscal year-to-date results, we've got a 5% underlying growth rate and to date, a 7% operating income growth rate, so about 2 points of leverage between sales and operating income, which is a little less than in some years in the past because we've been investing particularly in this brand's rollout of the company over the last year. But I mean that -- in the way we're sort of guiding for the end of the fiscal year, that relationship sort of stays the same as you -- even though we got the soft comps and we expect a strong Q4, the relationships stays the same. So we're -- it would be my guess that we're investing today at the operating investment line ahead of most of the competition based on what I see from their numbers versus ours.\n\n---\n\nTwo questions. First, last quarter, you highlighted some distributor inventory overhang that was still left from, I guess, going back in the first quarter in the U.S. and Germany. What was the impact of that reduction in the third quarter? And is that all behind us? And then the second question is in terms of how we should think about U.S. pricing going forward. Clearly this year was one of much more constrained pricing in the U.S. following several years of robust pricing. I know you're not a giving fiscal '16 guidance yet, but conceptually, should we think about next year looking more like this year? Or more like previous years? Somewhere in between? Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I'll talk to the distributor inventory for Germany as well as the U.S. It is behind us, largely came through in the third quarter. I think we had isolated about a point of impact when we talked about it in the second quarter in terms of what it was impacting our overall results. Tell me how you get to the third quarter because you've got another quarter end, like, it was less than that on the quarter in terms of the overall impact of our growth, okay?\n\n---\n\nYes. And I mean, just on pricing, I mean, we'll guide more specifically what our expectations are by the time we get out to our Q4 release and setting expectations for F '16. But I mean, I think one thing that would certainly be running through all of our minds is in where our core concentration is, which is more of the premium end of a category that has outstanding volume metric momentum right now. And I just really believe that you can be less aggressive with pricing when you're getting the sort of consumer interest and acceptance in bourbon and American whiskey like we're seeing. The high end of this category is growing, I mean, strong double-digit. I mean the overall category is growing in the high single digits in the United States. And so I mean, I think -- of course all these will vary by region and country around the world as we go along. But I think it was the right move for the company with the momentum and sort of enthusiasm we were seeing around the category volumetrically to sort of have, as you say, constrained the pricing progress in the way that we did in the last year and they think we're benefiting from it. So we'll be looking at that here over the next 8 weeks or so as we set our plan and give you more information on it specifically when we get into F '16 guidance.\n\n---\n\nI'll also try to be quick here. Can we just talk about pricing on 2 fronts? The first is emerging markets. When we have to take pricing in places like Russia and some of the other markets there where currencies has been such a big impact and -- do you expect any big pre-buying ahead of those price increases and maybe directionally how high they are? And then I just have a follow-up on how you price Tennessee Fire relative to Fireball.\n\n---\n\nSo talk about emerging markets. First off, I want to step back for a moment. Because FX is hurting us, it doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to take the price up to the consumer and the market. So it's something that we look at on a market-by-market basis. So I wanted to make sure that that was clear. We aren't going to jerk our prices up and down as FX goes up and down.\n\n---\n\nSo you're not going to offset, even in Russia where you have like a 50% devaluation?\n\n---\n\nNow Russia is an unusual one because it has been so significant for sure. Again, we look at these on a case-by-case basis. And we have already been through a price increase there. And talk about buying some stuff to move our needle, there wasn't. There hasn't been anything to move the needle that would warrant you to put something in your model as to replace the [indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nYes, and remember look not only at the -- at what the currency is doing in those instances, but you're really are also looking at what your competition is in the marketplace is doing. So as you can imagine, that's a pretty dynamic consideration. But it's rare for us. I mean it's sort of rare for the currency to move like this as rapidly as it has in Russia. But it's unusual for us, as Jane was citing, for us to start to make pricing moves based particularly on more moderate fluctuations in currency. And then your same question related to Tennessee Fire pricing philosophy.\n\n---\n\nYes, like relative to Fireball. I probably should know this, but I don't think Fireball advertises at all. So I mean, when you guys go out, you have roughly 100% share of voice when you launch this thing and kind of what kind of advertising you're going to do and how are you going to build trial.\n\n---\n\nWell, it depends on how you define advertising. Yes I would say that they have an enormous presence in social media, and I today consider that very much advertising. So I mean if you're talking about television advertising on cable networks or whatever, I haven't observed any. But to the gist of your question, I think, first and foremost, we price Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire off of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. I mean that is the foremost consideration in our price positioning for that for a variety of what I consider to be very good reasons. No we're not ignorant of where the marketplace falls out in terms of pricing and volume metrics and all that. We really wanted to enter this category as the premium, in this case, super-premium entrant in the cinnamon flavor segment. And I consider that to be a pretty important part of our marketing program and something that I know our people consider very important that they'll stick to. And so far what we've seen and our experience on Tennessee Honey with this, where they are today lower-priced competitors and have been, is that those prices have held up very well. And just to let you know, we have no internal designs or ambitions to do anything volume metrically that would compromise that price. I mean, we're not setting some internal ambition to be the #1 brand by volume or anything else. It's really to build a responsible business that super-premium and of this particular opportunity and to, along the way, be really responsible in the way we manage the Jack Daniel's trademark. So -- and actually I just think our people have demonstrated the capacity to do that so well that we really don't worry about it that much. The better thing for us to focus on is these early stages of distribution in creating the awareness. And I would tell you that I don't know we were still sort of refining how we'll communicate on behalf of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire over this first year of its national launch. But I would expect social media, just because of the importance of it to the brand's target audience but also just Jack Daniel's prominence as a trademark in social media to be very important to Tennessee Fire as well.\n\n---\n\nQuick technical one on the quarter and I see one on the revenue outlook. On the quarter, did I hear you, Jane, say -- I don't think I heard you right, you're saying FX you think that means EPS will actually be down in the fourth quarter? And then like I said that I have actually revenue questions.\n\n---\n\nYes. Just to clarify, the FX will hurt us in the fourth quarter so it will result in our reported numbers from underlying because we -- I said we would be up on an underlying basis in the teens and I'm saying I don't know if it -- we won't be up as strongly on a reported basis is what I was implying because of FX.\n\n---\n\nRight. Okay. You didn't say reported down. Okay. Great. Just needed to clarify that. And then on the revenue outlook, I guess a few things. Just firstly, Paul, with ad spend and its lagging sales year-to-date. Can you just update us on how that relationship you think works for the full year and from a longer-term perspective? And then with the quarter itself, you're looking for pretty healthy acceleration size going to contribute to that, I think 9 as the minimum number that it was for your rate of growth. Can you just talk about how you think about trade inventory in the U.S. specifically, what your attitude towards them potentially increasing it, putting aside the effect of Fire. I guess those are my 2 revenue-related questions.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I mean, it's just -- I guess, I answer the second question first. As we said earlier in the call, we expect our inventory, particularly if you include Fire at retail to be very much in line with our historical basis inventory around the globe. So no excessive building or diminishment either way. So I think it's a sort of normal course there. I would say on that point, I mean, it's always a swing factor as to how well received in the first sort of 60 days here so of Tennessee Fire's national launch. How much -- just the amount of distribution we expect that to be pretty rapid because the trade enthusiasm is so high, but also then it always comes down to how much display activity and promotional activity you'd get around that. So that's -- you hope for a nice piece of that and you would expect that the enthusiasm to convert to that. But that's a harder one for us to predict as it relates to what the April 30 retail inventories will be on a really new brand. So I hope that helps you understand how we're approaching it, otherwise, beyond the Tennessee Fire, we expect to be pretty normal course as it relates to days of inventory at retail in there. And your first question related to -- I'm just going to repeat it, make sure I got it right because we had a little bit of a broken communication here. I just wanted to see if there's a relationship between the way we think either historically or philosophically on A&P investment as a percentage of sale, is that -- I'm reading that right?\n\n---\n\nYes, basically. Like last fiscal year, you grew faster in sales. This fiscal year, it's not sales, slightly, which is how you're thinking about it going forward.\n\n---\n\nGoing forward, I mean, look, I think -- here's the way we've been and we've talked about this over the last couple of years, I mean, I really feel like we've spent a significant level of reinvestment in the business over the last 36 months and it's come in 3 forms really. It's been A&P, what I would consider to be -- because our results have warranted it and the A&P in fact had supported it, has been ahead of our competition. And in some instances, you always have pockets where you have an opportunity to invest more, one example being behind Jack Daniel's Black Label this past year in the United States. We helped our investment there. So there's always pockets but -- and we were -- also at the same time and I would highlight this last 18 months or so, as it relates to France and the investment in route-to-market and before that, we were investing in Germany and Turkey and all kinds of places we were adding at the SG&A line. And the third area, which didn't show up in the P&L as much right now, is the capital investments we've been making to get the company ready for the growth we foresee out many, many years into the future. So -- and those have been investments Woodford, Jack Daniel's, Fire, even the Sonoma-Cutrer. I mean, so we've had a string of capital investments that's been continuing most significantly. Cooperage as well as we are one only billed operator of manufacturers and operators. So there's not a wave here of investment. And still with that, we've been able to get nice leverage across the many years. And so I continue to expect -- I really do feel like we're at a point where -- particularly some of the SG&A that we can start to leverage some of the investments we've made in particularly the route-to-market around the world, I mean, I, over long periods of time, like to see generally A&P -- it doesn't -- I don't -- I'm not worried about it in 1 particular quarter or year per se to track along with sales. I mean, I just think it's a nice thing. It all depends on the brand-building model. And I do think social media will make it more efficient, not less efficient, to actually invest over time. But I would expect after many, many years of very systematic and continuous investment that the company should still be able, from sales to operating income, to be able to get a little leverage. I mean there were times in our history -- I mean, I know way back where there was very little leverage. It was up and down the P&L the same number, and in terms of growth rate. But I really do feel like, this will vary by what time you're operating in, too, and how the economies are and everything else. But as we stand right now, I mean, I think we cited was we're 5% growth right now converted to 7% and investing nicely behind the business. And we see that elevating by year-end because of the soft comps and the things that we cited. But as you go out, I mean, I feel like we would be gaining share of voice with mid-single digit even, a growth rate in A&P compared to our competition right now. I mean, that's my take.\n\n---\n\nThat's a great comparison to. If I could just one last -- on your comments on U.S. pricing I find very interesting because you enjoy premium positioning in your various points versus the nearest competition. And you also enjoy volume momentum. So that seems to favor being more -- seeking more rates of price growth not only to strengthen your position of your brands, but to kind of be a -- it's a time to do it if your volumes are doing well, yet you're saying you want to have, like, comparatively the higher focus on maintaining volume on that. So could you just talk a little bit about why -- does it have to do with the inventory you've already got to sort of ready to come on stream. Can you just talk a little bit about why you have that attitude because it seems you can make the opposite argument for -- to be more disciplined on price.\n\n---\n\nYou absolutely can make the opposite argument, depending upon how you approach it. But I'll give you the example here. And we do know -- look, with aged products, a dollar a pricing is more valuable mathematically if you look at it than perhaps a dollar or volume. But in an expanding category where people are fighting for consumption occasions and consumers, you don't want to lose some of these consumers because we have found people who adopt and fall in love with the brand will actually continue some of that consumption. And so it can be a more costly later to try to get it. And -- but I give you the example of here we've got a Woodford Reserve, just take that as an example. And let's say you -- I mean, the brand's gone 25% or 30%, I guess, we could consider that -- just taking your example to a specific thing to consider here is I guess we could take our prices up on Woodford Reserve 10% or 12%. And so over the same dollars through a lower growth rate, I mean, you could do the math on that. But I feel like for brands at an early stage of development, introducing the brand, you're still at relatively low levels of awareness and adoption to introduce the brand to consumers and at lower prices, not that we're lowering price, I mean even at 25% or 30% growth rate, we might be taking 2% or 3% price increase. So it's not like we're not taking pricing. It's just that you're delivering -- the volume metrics are a reflection of the adoption of consumerism around the brand. And if you've already started, in this case with Woodford and ultra-premium price position, I mean, if you had a significant shortage in your stocks or something, sure, you could do a supply-demand trade-off there and you might find yourself in those circumstances if your forecasts weren't particularly accurate. But that's not the case with us. And so I mean, I think introducing 30% more occasions or consumers to the base of Woodford Reserve is today on balance better than asking the current base to pay 15% higher prices and only attracting 10% or 15% people. I mean, that's just a trade-off. You can definitely make the other argument. But at this stage of development with this base of awareness and distribution on a brand like that, I would favor the way we're doing it.\n\n---\n\nThanks for that question, Mark, and thanks, Paul and Jane. Thanks to all of you for joining us today for Brown-Forman's third quarter earnings call, and we hope you all have a great week.\n\n---\n\nThanks, everyone.\n\n---\n\nThanks.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Vivien Azer (Analysts)】\nSo my first question has to do with the depletion trends in the quarter. It looks like they slowed a little bit, but I see that that's on a tough comp. So could you dive in a little bit more in terms of the depletion trends specifically for 3Q, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes, Vivien. I think the way I would look at that, if you looked at our first quarter trends, I think they're a little bit soft, though, you're right. Q2 was a little bit stronger, and Q3 is a little bit down versus Q2. But I think it's all relative to last year. So really, if you look at where we were through the first half, we're at 2%. We're still at 2%. So I don't really see a slowdown. I think it's really -- can't really look at 1 quarter in isolation, if you will. In fact, I see improving trends, particularly in the U.S. we experience some nice acceleration there. So I think a lot of what you're seeing is simply a difficult comp that I was referring to in my script and we also alluded to in our earnings release as it related to some buy-ins last year in Poland. But we don't -- we are not seeing it -- I don't view it as a slowdown. You're going to see these one-off things happening when you look at quarter-to-quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vivien Azer (Analysts)】\nThat's very helpful. Jane, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that Fire continues to track well relative to Tennessee Honey. At your Investor Day, you indicated it was about 1.35x. Can you give us a little bit more detail on how the trajectory has evolved as you've kind of included 5 more states in this comparison?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes, so just to reiterate how encouraged we are about what we are seeing and how excited our people are, the trade is and the consumer are wanting and excited about seeing a super-premium cinnamon brand expression from Jack Daniel's. So you're right, we did talk about the early test market back in -- at our investor conference. We are not seeing a slowing. We continue to see somewhere in the 130% to 140% indexing. So we've not seen it slow down, if you will. It's maintained and we're very encouraged by that. With that being said, these are unchartered waters for us a bit, given it is a higher price offering versus what the category price point -- that already exists. But nonetheless, we're very excited. We just started shipping our first cases out a couple of weeks ago to the remaining 42 states, as I said earlier. So time will tell, but we're very -- I think we're very positioned well for that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, the trade reaction so far is -- I mean if anything, because there was some pent-up demand. I'd say the national rollout has been received with as much or even more enthusiasm as the original sort of test markets were. And the thing that's so interesting when you go national is you have the ability to use things like media, the ability for social media to help you -- I mean this brand -- I would give you one sort of I thought -- that I thought was an interesting thing I heard in the last month on this that the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire Twitter followers have already eclipsed the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey followers. And so while it's too early to know how the actual consumer acceptance in terms of real purchases in the marketplace will unfold, what we've seen so far, both at trade and consumer, on this is really encouraging.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vivien Azer (Analysts)】\nThat's very good news. My last question just in terms of the acceleration that you're seeing in the United States, can you talk about the balance between on- and off-premise? I think you guys pointed to some improving trends on-premise last quarter, so I'm curious if that's continued.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes, I can talk a little bit and Paul can chime in. I think the latest NABCA information through January indicated that the on-premise trends are continuing to accelerate, both overall spirits is up and Brown-Forman were beating the overall spirits. So Jack Daniel's itself continues to improve as well. I think we're up about 2% in the on-premise. It's up 1 point -- about 0.5 point over the prior month. So we continuously, since about last March or April, have seen a continued improvement in overall trends in the on-premise and this has impacted favorably our brands. I will say when I look at our brands, Old Forester is our fastest-growing on-premise brand by a long shot. But we've got a lot of other brands that are growing quite nicely in the on-premise, too, Woodford Reserve, el Jimador. They're growing very, very strongly. Gentleman Jack is doing well. So the trends are improving. We'll see what kind of weather you guys are predicting there today, but we're predicting more snow here today. So remember last year, the winter was quite bad and I know the month of February has been dicey around the states -- United States. So -- but we think we got a couple more months of soft comps, depending again how the weather goes over the next couple of months.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nAnd of course U.S. comment -- I mean, we don't have as great a visibility and timeliness on international on-premise. But it's been our experience here, as with the places where these economies have been difficult to be on-premise along with some of the off-premise has continued to show some weakness. But I would say that even though the on-premise -- I mean, the strength particularly of this U.S. off-premise environment as spirit brands, and I'll say premium spirit brands, are very much affordable luxuries still. And so if you just compare per drink outlaid by the consumer for either a bottle of Jack Daniel's or Woodford Reserve compared too many other entertainment alternatives stacks up quite nice. I think the off-premise continues to really drive in the U.S. market. And not to diminish the impact of recovering on-premise, but I mean, at least our read of the last 12 months of U.S. distilled spirit sales, driven in great in part by our core category, bourbon and American whiskey, has upticked a little bit.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Faucher (Analysts)】\nI apologize, I got a little confused in terms of the impact in France vis-à-vis the impact in Poland. Were they similar impacts with all of that in the most recent quarter? Is that the way we should look at that? And so that's more of a housekeeping question. And then sort of a longer-term question, Paul, you talked about sort of being single sourced and that's been a huge advantage for you, allows you guys to build scale, what have you. But U.S.-based manufacturing costs could provide a little bit of pressure over the next several years if we continue to see strength in the dollar. So can you talk a little bit about how you guys are looking at that? If we do have a stronger dollar longer-term, what you can do in place to offset some of the transactional FX impacts that you guys are expecting.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nSure, I'll tackle that, while Jane considers your first question here. Yes, I mean, these are always trade-offs to be a single point producer in the United States at the time of the strengthening dollar. Yes, I mean, there's all these trends. I would tell you, it's better to be positioned at the very high end of a market versus the low end when that's happening because proportionately, the FX impact is less so -- on your profits. And so I feel like net-net, when you balance it all out, the efficiencies -- and we've been well served over these years by the single point production and efficiency. And frankly, also that just the importance of that home place and the imported status that's conferred to Jack Daniel's as an imported American whiskey when it leaves the shores of the United States have all been very important to the brand's development over the years. So I think there's both efficiency reasons that you asked questions, also some marketing ones. I do think there are things that are implied, in some ways even more indirectly than directly, as the dollar strengthens. I mean, I think the most significant is that, at least the way I think about it, there might be a big rationalization here. But if you think about why the U.S. dollar has been strengthening, one of the contributing factors is the strength of the U.S. economy and -- relative to other countries. And the way I look at it, we happen to have the good fortune of having -- as a largest country. It's the most valuable distilled spirits market in the world. It's our home country, which we know very well. And it also happens within our industry to be one of the most exciting times for our core categories. So I know this might be a very simplistic way of thinking, but the way I think about it is, as it relates to things, everything from resource allocation or innovation or the way that we think about developing our business at the time when the U.S. dollar is strong is make sure you're maximizing the opportunities available to you in the United States market is one thing. And so that's one of the ways in this past year we certainly have upped our investment behind Jack Daniel's. You heard us talk about the introduction here of Tennessee Fire, which is an innovative effort. You've -- I mean, empathize very strongly here the ultra-premium whiskeys, which have the predominant presence for them. The largest markets in each one of those cases is the United States. So I think it's a reminder to all of us as Brown-Forman's managers to really make sure you're doing the best possible job you can in the markets to be attractive, it is in some ways causing the dollar to strengthen. So -- and that's different than -- I mean, it's certainly, sure, a U.S.-based company is a wonderful time to either be making acquisitions in Europe or to be borrowing in European denominations, those kinds of things. But those alone aren't reasons to go do it. They're just -- they increased, I think, the benefits of time and as you think about it. But I think the biggest takeaway is for us to make sure we're doing the best possible job in the United States.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nOkay. I'll follow-up on your housekeeping question. Let's see, I see France and Poland as 2 different things. The reason why we illustrated France for you was because it impacted our third quarter only reported results, so when we're providing a reconciliation, understanding between reported and underlying. So it's the reported aspect. Poland, on the other hand, has been something that has hurt us all 2014, following the excessive or huge significant tax increase taken last Jan 1. And as a result of that, it's been a market that has impacted our comparisons all year long. And we do expect easier comps as we go into the fourth quarter. That has impact on our underlying results, and that's why I isolated Poland as it related to our discussion. I hope that helps.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Faucher (Analysts)】\nThat does. But does that mean that the impact -- would the impact in Q3 the same -- do they offset each other generally? In understanding the differences between the situations, was there a rough offset between the 2 countries in the third quarter specifically?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nNo.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nNo.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nAnd again, one was on a reported basis and one is underlying. France did not impact the underlying results. It's not reported. Poland...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes. And the impact in France that we've highlighted, I think, if I got it right, would be larger than the direct impact that you were citing for the underlying in Poland, don't you think? I think as it relates to -- even though one is an underlying, one is in the reported, but there was a significant -- it was, what, in terms of estimated net change in distributor inventories is a 6-point quarterly impact on France. And I don't know, did Poland impact 6 points at the underlying?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nWell, it impacted my emerging markets.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nEmerging markets, yes, but not the corporation. Yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judy Hong (Analysts)】\nJust following up on Poland. I guess I'm curious to hear more about the underlying trends. I think, Jane, you had talked about last quarter where obviously the shipment numbers that you've been reporting has been impacted by the inventory movement, but the underlying trends were starting to improve. So I just wanted to understand if that's continuing in the back half of the year. And then as it relates to the fourth quarter sales guidance, obviously, you're expecting pretty sizable acceleration. The comps are easier. But just in terms of thinking about some of the underlying trends, are you expecting any sizable improvement in some of the markets? It sounds like maybe Tennessee Fire is adding about a couple of points to sales in terms of pipe sales. So can you just verify that number? And is there any inventory movement that we should be thinking about as it relates to the fourth quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nA lot there, Judy.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nI mean, I'll talk about...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nLet me to talk about Poland.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes, are you ready on Poland? Because I could answer the last one if you want me to.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes, I can start on Poland. And what we are seeing there and continue to see, as it relates to the premium whiskey in the Polish market as well as Jack Daniel's from an underlying takeaway trend perspective, we see accelerating results, so another -- I'll just give you one example. The premium whiskey is growing 33% in Poland market on a 3-month basis, up from 25% on a 12-month. So similarly, Black Label is growing 13% on a 3-month, up 9% on a 12-month, so you can see the acceleration there. And again, the excise tax or the comparisons impacted the difficult comps that we've been talking about all along impacted both Jack Daniel's Black Label and Finlandia. So neither brand has been growing at the takeaway trend rates that I'm showing here. The takeaway trends for Finlandia are much better than what we're seeing in our current results as well. So 12-month trends are running 3%, and we're down right now year-over-year again. So that gives you a little bit of flavor that the takeaway trends the consumer has taken is working its way through all the inventory and the adjustments from the excise tax a year ago. So did that help on Poland?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judy Hong (Analysts)】\nYes. And are we done with all the inventory destocking that needed to get cleaned out?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nOn Poland? Yes, it will be. Yes, that's behind us.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nFor the purposes of comparison, we hope there's no more excise tax increase. But now, yes, you'll always have the trading pace. But as it relates to what we're guiding today, yes. And Judy, I think the other question you have there was what are the components that give us the confidence, and you cited that all of them -- I'll just comment in a general way. The biggest thing are the soft comps that relate to, for example, Poland and in Europe that we feel that are -- were in Q4 last year that we do expect and would, as part of our guidance, the United States to continue to accelerate along the lines of what we've been seeing, so the industry and the category but also our business has been accelerating. So it's with that expectation that, that will continue through the fourth quarter. And we think we got the right sort of, I think, investments and programming and system effort around that to accomplish what we want. And then you mentioned the other one, which is Tennessee Fire. And then Tennessee Fire, in addition, which is this a U.S. comment, its introduction to the United States on a national level is the other contributing factor that we would be incorporating into that acceleration. So those are the main 3 components that the soft comp U.S. acceleration with some Tennessee Fire on top of it. Now you also asked would that create any inventory things, and the only inventory things, that I think Jane might have highlighted a little bit, would be on Tennessee Fire pipeline because you will ship some in a course -- at a national launch in advance of the depletions, and so there might be a little there. But otherwise, we're expecting inventories to largely be in balance at the end of the year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nNo different really from where we are.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judy Hong (Analysts)】\nOkay. So just to clarify on Fire, because you had called out few cents of EPS spend as it related to pipe sale in the fourth quarter, so I guess that implies roughly 1.5 to 2 points of sales impact that potentially would come...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nOn a reported basis.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judy Hong (Analysts)】\nOn a reported basis. Okay. But that's not included in your underlying sales growth guidance?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nThe impact on our underlying full year impact is less than 1 point -- less than 0.5 point as I recall.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nWe're investing back behind the Fire launch.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Judy Hong (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then, Jane, just lastly on FX. I know we'll get obviously full year guidance for next year when you report next quarter, and FX continues to be a moving target. But if I just sort of take where the spot prices are today, I get to another $0.15 or so of negative FX. I just wanted to understand if there's anything missing in terms of hedging exposure or transaction that I'm missing as I calculate the impact as of today.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nThe only thing that I would say is, as I've been trying to explain as we talk the last 2 quarters about transactional and translational FX, so the transactional being attributable to our translating our foreign-denominated net current assets back to the U.S. dollars. Assuming the spot rates stay where they are today, we had a pretty significant impact. I talked about, I think its $22 million, $23 million that's showing up in our other income and expense line item, I would consider that onetime in nature, if you will, if the spot rates stay where they are. So that would not repeat itself next year, if you're thinking about hits of FX from this year. So that would come -- be a favorable comparison, if you will, next year. That's the only thing right now I would say. It's just in terms of how we hedge, and I think we've discussed that before in our hedging philosophy and how we roll in our hedges actually over time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Spillane (Analysts)】\nJust, Jane, just 2 quick questions relative to the quarter. One, I think you said that underlying SG&A was up 6% in the quarter. Did you give us what underlying advertising was up or down in the quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\n4% in this quarter, I believe. Hold on, let me double check that. I'm sorry. It was up 4% in the quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Spillane (Analysts)】\nUp 4%.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\n3%.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\n3%, I'm sorry.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nWas up 3% for year-to-date.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\n3% for year-to-date, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bryan Spillane (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then second question, just -- I seemed to recall from the last -- from the Q2 earnings call that underlying sales growth was 7% and the expectation was that -- it had accelerated to 7% and it wouldn't move from that. So I'm just trying to understand was the third quarter a little bit light relative to what you're expecting? Or was that comment about you don't expect to get -- you'd expect to hold or get better or more of a comment of what you were thinking over the second half instead of specifically the third quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes, actually, Bryan, that's a great question. And what we were referring -- what we said was the back half not -- we weren't giving quarterly guidance, so we were saying we were expecting the back half to not -- to go down, if you will, or to change. So well, I think the third quarter was largely in line with what we expected. We knew we were going to have difficult top line comparisons the last year where we had a really strong third quarter growing top line 8%. So our comment was more as it related to the back half.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes. Overall, I think it sort of met our expectations. I mean, you can always expect a few of the places around the world would have -- we would have hoped for more, but actually I think the U.S. actually surprised us on the upside a little bit from my point of view. So -- but I think we're sticking to what we basically said back in the Q2 call as it relates to the back half.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy Ramey (Analysts)】\nJust skipping from kind of the macro negative of FX to what seemed to me to be a couple of meaningful macro positive, gas prices in Travel Retail. Can you talk about -- I mean, I do recall hearing those as negatives on the way up. Are you starting to see benefits in perhaps on-premise or Travel Retail segment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes. So we have discussed a little bit earlier mainly it was all around the U.S., but we do continue to see on-premise trends for our brands continuing, growing in the low single digits so -- overall. We do think there has been, if you look back and when the acceleration began, there seems to be a correlation between when gas prices started going down. So perhaps having a few extra pennies in their pockets to buy this affordable luxury, if you will. As it relates to Travel Retail business, we've actually had mixed results there. I think we're seeing parts of the world doing very well, but places over in Europe, largely around Russia, our European operations because of the disruption going on in that part of the world and the number of consumers from Russia, actually, is a large percentage that actually purchased in the European market has been a little bit lighter than we would have hoped for. And so -- but we have seen some good -- in certain parts -- certain travel retail markets around the world. And I hope that's due to gas prices and more affordable. But it's hard to say, tell you, with FX and who -- where people are coming from and how that may be way more than offsetting gas prices other than the consumers in the U.S., I think is probably a larger trend to pay attention to.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes, as it relates to the U.S. market, I don't -- I mean I don't have any specific data on this, but I do know anecdotally that we might even have stronger on-premise U.S. numbers if -- particularly European tourism wasn't being hit by the strong dollar. I mean, I feel -- we've heard restaurants and we know from hotels and places like that, that they're not as buoyant as they were 6 or 8 months ago. So I mean, those are -- all these things have offsets to each other as you go around the world for Brown-Forman. It's one of the benefits that we accrue for having such nice geographic diversity. But I think net-net for our business around the world, the low gas prices are help net-net, and of course they should be help -- particularly if they stay down for quite some time, they would be a help to you, you'd expect, like fuel cost and energy and things like that. They will make their way in. And -- but on the flip side, what ends up happening is for a company like us, you end up having negative foreign exchange impact with. So -- and these things offset each other in some ways partially or not. But I will say this, we do spend some time looking at what foreign exchange rate indices look like. And I mean, I would note that I think that the last time we looked at it, the current index is the dollar is stronger than its sort of 20-year average, and it always fluctuates above and below that average, of course. But this would be a particular time of strength. So for those who are thinking about how much more will this run or how long, if you believe history at all, the U.S. dollar is at a stronger point than its historical index would indicate.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ian Shackleton (Analysts)】\nTwo questions. Firstly, within the emerging markets, the commentary on Russia actually, it is more positive. Now I remember you had some specific issues in Russia. Are they all now resolved now? And the second question was around the Investor Day in December, you did talk quite a bit about scotch and Irish whiskey being attractive categories to go into. Is there any update you can provide us on that at this stage?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nI can talk about Russia real quick. We are pleased with Russia in terms of the tone, and doing pretty well there. We had a net sales growth of around 6%, I think, year-to-date through 9 months. Of course it's being hurt by the devaluation of the ruble. But specifically, as it relates to our ability to sell our products and reach the consumers and have things been up there, if you will, we're very encouraged by what we've seen. And so like, we're able to sell our product in the marketplace at this point in time.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes, Ian. And I think you are correct in your recall of our interest, particularly I'd say in the -- at the ultra-premium, the super-premium-plus segments of those particular categories. I mean, no real news to update you on other to say that we remain as excited about that as we study those marketplaces and the continuing development of them. I mean, it's only been a couple of months since we you saw in December so -- I would say this, the only thing that might change is for a U.S.-based company if you can find attractive properties, and either one of those, it's even more attractive because of the currency as I mentioned. And you could tell probably from my initial comments that we really think -- I highlighted American whiskey, but we really think the premium end of whiskey is a very attractive place to play. I mean amongst the most that you can really kind of -- to be quite honest with you, not only within our industry, I just think it's enormously attractive and valuable business when you contrast it to many other industry. So you want to find the most attractive and advisable investments you can make there. So we are scanning that as we -- as you would expect us to.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ian Shackleton (Analysts)】\nSo just going back in Russia because there was some sort of a boycott there by -- has it all gone away, if I recall it correctly?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nA boycott on our products? Is that what you're saying?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ian Shackleton (Analysts)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nWe had some administrative labeling things in a particular region of Russia that temporarily disrupted our sales into accounts there on Tennessee Honey. And it was just -- so it was a very small part of Brown-Forman's total Russia business. And there's been some, I think, generally positive administrative development on that front. So I would say things as it relates to probably the larger question on Russia for us is just the impact of all of this on their economy more so than what we would declare as any kind of administrative problems or trade restrictions, those kinds of things. Truly right now more the impact on the economy.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephanie Benjamin (Analysts)】\nThis is actually Stephanie, in for Bill. My question has to do with advertising and if you could provide either on a reported or underlying perspective more details on what you expect next quarter, particularly with the launch of Tennessee Fire. And then just kind of going off of that, what do you expect in terms of kind of -- or what you're seeing with your competitive -- your competitors in terms of what they're doing for advertising?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nOkay. So we are spending -- we're, as you know, we're at 4% year-to-date underlying increase in net sales. We are going to expand to launch the brand quite nicely in the fourth quarter. So I would expect that number to tick up a little bit, up from where we are on a year-to-date basis. So by the end of the year, the number will be more than 4%. I hope that answers that question. And then your other question around competitors and I -- we're not -- I can't really answer all the questions there in terms of what they're doing. They definitely vary by market, varies by brand.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nI looked at a weighted average of our competition. We sometimes do try to study the difference between maybe their sales growth rate and their operating income growth rate as a guide. It looks to me like they -- because they're -- most of the industry when you look at it is growing a very low organic growth rate. And then when you translate, at least the way they're guiding as an operating income or EBITDA growth rate, it might just be a little bit higher. So that it would appear to me that somewhere, I can't be specific to advertising, but somewhere between advertising and SG&A investment, they might be getting 1 point or maybe 0.2 of leverage from whatever they have reported or whatever they're guiding on sales. So a little bit of leverage, but I can't imagine that people are in very strong investment mode or else it will be showing up with a diminishment to operating income versus an increase. And so if you think about us, I mean, our fiscal year-to-date results, we've got a 5% underlying growth rate and to date, a 7% operating income growth rate, so about 2 points of leverage between sales and operating income, which is a little less than in some years in the past because we've been investing particularly in this brand's rollout of the company over the last year. But I mean that -- in the way we're sort of guiding for the end of the fiscal year, that relationship sort of stays the same as you -- even though we got the soft comps and we expect a strong Q4, the relationships stays the same. So we're -- it would be my guess that we're investing today at the operating investment line ahead of most of the competition based on what I see from their numbers versus ours.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Serotta (Analysts)】\nTwo questions. First, last quarter, you highlighted some distributor inventory overhang that was still left from, I guess, going back in the first quarter in the U.S. and Germany. What was the impact of that reduction in the third quarter? And is that all behind us? And then the second question is in terms of how we should think about U.S. pricing going forward. Clearly this year was one of much more constrained pricing in the U.S. following several years of robust pricing. I know you're not a giving fiscal '16 guidance yet, but conceptually, should we think about next year looking more like this year? Or more like previous years? Somewhere in between? Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nOkay. I'll talk to the distributor inventory for Germany as well as the U.S. It is behind us, largely came through in the third quarter. I think we had isolated about a point of impact when we talked about it in the second quarter in terms of what it was impacting our overall results. Tell me how you get to the third quarter because you've got another quarter end, like, it was less than that on the quarter in terms of the overall impact of our growth, okay?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes. And I mean, just on pricing, I mean, we'll guide more specifically what our expectations are by the time we get out to our Q4 release and setting expectations for F '16. But I mean, I think one thing that would certainly be running through all of our minds is in where our core concentration is, which is more of the premium end of a category that has outstanding volume metric momentum right now. And I just really believe that you can be less aggressive with pricing when you're getting the sort of consumer interest and acceptance in bourbon and American whiskey like we're seeing. The high end of this category is growing, I mean, strong double-digit. I mean the overall category is growing in the high single digits in the United States. And so I mean, I think -- of course all these will vary by region and country around the world as we go along. But I think it was the right move for the company with the momentum and sort of enthusiasm we were seeing around the category volumetrically to sort of have, as you say, constrained the pricing progress in the way that we did in the last year and they think we're benefiting from it. So we'll be looking at that here over the next 8 weeks or so as we set our plan and give you more information on it specifically when we get into F '16 guidance.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Schmitz (Analysts)】\nI'll also try to be quick here. Can we just talk about pricing on 2 fronts? The first is emerging markets. When we have to take pricing in places like Russia and some of the other markets there where currencies has been such a big impact and -- do you expect any big pre-buying ahead of those price increases and maybe directionally how high they are? And then I just have a follow-up on how you price Tennessee Fire relative to Fireball.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nSo talk about emerging markets. First off, I want to step back for a moment. Because FX is hurting us, it doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to take the price up to the consumer and the market. So it's something that we look at on a market-by-market basis. So I wanted to make sure that that was clear. We aren't going to jerk our prices up and down as FX goes up and down.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Schmitz (Analysts)】\nSo you're not going to offset, even in Russia where you have like a 50% devaluation?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nNow Russia is an unusual one because it has been so significant for sure. Again, we look at these on a case-by-case basis. And we have already been through a price increase there. And talk about buying some stuff to move our needle, there wasn't. There hasn't been anything to move the needle that would warrant you to put something in your model as to replace the [indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYes, and remember look not only at the -- at what the currency is doing in those instances, but you're really are also looking at what your competition is in the marketplace is doing. So as you can imagine, that's a pretty dynamic consideration. But it's rare for us. I mean it's sort of rare for the currency to move like this as rapidly as it has in Russia. But it's unusual for us, as Jane was citing, for us to start to make pricing moves based particularly on more moderate fluctuations in currency. And then your same question related to Tennessee Fire pricing philosophy.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Schmitz (Analysts)】\nYes, like relative to Fireball. I probably should know this, but I don't think Fireball advertises at all. So I mean, when you guys go out, you have roughly 100% share of voice when you launch this thing and kind of what kind of advertising you're going to do and how are you going to build trial.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nWell, it depends on how you define advertising. Yes I would say that they have an enormous presence in social media, and I today consider that very much advertising. So I mean if you're talking about television advertising on cable networks or whatever, I haven't observed any. But to the gist of your question, I think, first and foremost, we price Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire off of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. I mean that is the foremost consideration in our price positioning for that for a variety of what I consider to be very good reasons. No we're not ignorant of where the marketplace falls out in terms of pricing and volume metrics and all that. We really wanted to enter this category as the premium, in this case, super-premium entrant in the cinnamon flavor segment. And I consider that to be a pretty important part of our marketing program and something that I know our people consider very important that they'll stick to. And so far what we've seen and our experience on Tennessee Honey with this, where they are today lower-priced competitors and have been, is that those prices have held up very well. And just to let you know, we have no internal designs or ambitions to do anything volume metrically that would compromise that price. I mean, we're not setting some internal ambition to be the #1 brand by volume or anything else. It's really to build a responsible business that super-premium and of this particular opportunity and to, along the way, be really responsible in the way we manage the Jack Daniel's trademark. So -- and actually I just think our people have demonstrated the capacity to do that so well that we really don't worry about it that much. The better thing for us to focus on is these early stages of distribution in creating the awareness. And I would tell you that I don't know we were still sort of refining how we'll communicate on behalf of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire over this first year of its national launch. But I would expect social media, just because of the importance of it to the brand's target audience but also just Jack Daniel's prominence as a trademark in social media to be very important to Tennessee Fire as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Swartzberg (Analysts)】\nQuick technical one on the quarter and I see one on the revenue outlook. On the quarter, did I hear you, Jane, say -- I don't think I heard you right, you're saying FX you think that means EPS will actually be down in the fourth quarter? And then like I said that I have actually revenue questions.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jane Morreau (Executives)】\nYes. Just to clarify, the FX will hurt us in the fourth quarter so it will result in our reported numbers from underlying because we -- I said we would be up on an underlying basis in the teens and I'm saying I don't know if it -- we won't be up as strongly on a reported basis is what I was implying because of FX.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Swartzberg (Analysts)】\nRight. Okay. You didn't say reported down. Okay. Great. Just needed to clarify that. And then on the revenue outlook, I guess a few things. Just firstly, Paul, with ad spend and its lagging sales year-to-date. Can you just update us on how that relationship you think works for the full year and from a longer-term perspective? And then with the quarter itself, you're looking for pretty healthy acceleration size going to contribute to that, I think 9 as the minimum number that it was for your rate of growth. Can you just talk about how you think about trade inventory in the U.S. specifically, what your attitude towards them potentially increasing it, putting aside the effect of Fire. I guess those are my 2 revenue-related questions.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nOkay. I mean, it's just -- I guess, I answer the second question first. As we said earlier in the call, we expect our inventory, particularly if you include Fire at retail to be very much in line with our historical basis inventory around the globe. So no excessive building or diminishment either way. So I think it's a sort of normal course there. I would say on that point, I mean, it's always a swing factor as to how well received in the first sort of 60 days here so of Tennessee Fire's national launch. How much -- just the amount of distribution we expect that to be pretty rapid because the trade enthusiasm is so high, but also then it always comes down to how much display activity and promotional activity you'd get around that. So that's -- you hope for a nice piece of that and you would expect that the enthusiasm to convert to that. But that's a harder one for us to predict as it relates to what the April 30 retail inventories will be on a really new brand. So I hope that helps you understand how we're approaching it, otherwise, beyond the Tennessee Fire, we expect to be pretty normal course as it relates to days of inventory at retail in there. And your first question related to -- I'm just going to repeat it, make sure I got it right because we had a little bit of a broken communication here. I just wanted to see if there's a relationship between the way we think either historically or philosophically on A&P investment as a percentage of sale, is that -- I'm reading that right?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Swartzberg (Analysts)】\nYes, basically. Like last fiscal year, you grew faster in sales. This fiscal year, it's not sales, slightly, which is how you're thinking about it going forward.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nGoing forward, I mean, look, I think -- here's the way we've been and we've talked about this over the last couple of years, I mean, I really feel like we've spent a significant level of reinvestment in the business over the last 36 months and it's come in 3 forms really. It's been A&P, what I would consider to be -- because our results have warranted it and the A&P in fact had supported it, has been ahead of our competition. And in some instances, you always have pockets where you have an opportunity to invest more, one example being behind Jack Daniel's Black Label this past year in the United States. We helped our investment there. So there's always pockets but -- and we were -- also at the same time and I would highlight this last 18 months or so, as it relates to France and the investment in route-to-market and before that, we were investing in Germany and Turkey and all kinds of places we were adding at the SG&A line. And the third area, which didn't show up in the P&L as much right now, is the capital investments we've been making to get the company ready for the growth we foresee out many, many years into the future. So -- and those have been investments Woodford, Jack Daniel's, Fire, even the Sonoma-Cutrer. I mean, so we've had a string of capital investments that's been continuing most significantly. Cooperage as well as we are one only billed operator of manufacturers and operators. So there's not a wave here of investment. And still with that, we've been able to get nice leverage across the many years. And so I continue to expect -- I really do feel like we're at a point where -- particularly some of the SG&A that we can start to leverage some of the investments we've made in particularly the route-to-market around the world, I mean, I, over long periods of time, like to see generally A&P -- it doesn't -- I don't -- I'm not worried about it in 1 particular quarter or year per se to track along with sales. I mean, I just think it's a nice thing. It all depends on the brand-building model. And I do think social media will make it more efficient, not less efficient, to actually invest over time. But I would expect after many, many years of very systematic and continuous investment that the company should still be able, from sales to operating income, to be able to get a little leverage. I mean there were times in our history -- I mean, I know way back where there was very little leverage. It was up and down the P&L the same number, and in terms of growth rate. But I really do feel like, this will vary by what time you're operating in, too, and how the economies are and everything else. But as we stand right now, I mean, I think we cited was we're 5% growth right now converted to 7% and investing nicely behind the business. And we see that elevating by year-end because of the soft comps and the things that we cited. But as you go out, I mean, I feel like we would be gaining share of voice with mid-single digit even, a growth rate in A&P compared to our competition right now. I mean, that's my take.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Swartzberg (Analysts)】\nThat's a great comparison to. If I could just one last -- on your comments on U.S. pricing I find very interesting because you enjoy premium positioning in your various points versus the nearest competition. And you also enjoy volume momentum. So that seems to favor being more -- seeking more rates of price growth not only to strengthen your position of your brands, but to kind of be a -- it's a time to do it if your volumes are doing well, yet you're saying you want to have, like, comparatively the higher focus on maintaining volume on that. So could you just talk a little bit about why -- does it have to do with the inventory you've already got to sort of ready to come on stream. Can you just talk a little bit about why you have that attitude because it seems you can make the opposite argument for -- to be more disciplined on price.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Varga (Executives)】\nYou absolutely can make the opposite argument, depending upon how you approach it. But I'll give you the example here. And we do know -- look, with aged products, a dollar a pricing is more valuable mathematically if you look at it than perhaps a dollar or volume. But in an expanding category where people are fighting for consumption occasions and consumers, you don't want to lose some of these consumers because we have found people who adopt and fall in love with the brand will actually continue some of that consumption. And so it can be a more costly later to try to get it. And -- but I give you the example of here we've got a Woodford Reserve, just take that as an example. And let's say you -- I mean, the brand's gone 25% or 30%, I guess, we could consider that -- just taking your example to a specific thing to consider here is I guess we could take our prices up on Woodford Reserve 10% or 12%. And so over the same dollars through a lower growth rate, I mean, you could do the math on that. But I feel like for brands at an early stage of development, introducing the brand, you're still at relatively low levels of awareness and adoption to introduce the brand to consumers and at lower prices, not that we're lowering price, I mean even at 25% or 30% growth rate, we might be taking 2% or 3% price increase. So it's not like we're not taking pricing. It's just that you're delivering -- the volume metrics are a reflection of the adoption of consumerism around the brand. And if you've already started, in this case with Woodford and ultra-premium price position, I mean, if you had a significant shortage in your stocks or something, sure, you could do a supply-demand trade-off there and you might find yourself in those circumstances if your forecasts weren't particularly accurate. But that's not the case with us. And so I mean, I think introducing 30% more occasions or consumers to the base of Woodford Reserve is today on balance better than asking the current base to pay 15% higher prices and only attracting 10% or 15% people. I mean, that's just a trade-off. You can definitely make the other argument. But at this stage of development with this base of awareness and distribution on a brand like that, I would favor the way we're doing it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jason Koval (Executives)】\nThanks for that question, Mark, and thanks, Paul and Jane.

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Rich. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Red Hat's earnings call for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Speakers for today's call will be Jim Whitehurst, President and CEO; Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Paul Cormier, Executive Vice President of Products and Technology.\r\nOur press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from redhat.com on the Investor Relations page. Also on this page, you'll be able to find a historic reconciliation schedule of GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics as well as a schedule on currency rates.\r\nVarious remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans, prospects, including statements containing the words believe, anticipate, plan, project, estimate, expect, intend or will, constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC, as well as the Safe Harbor statement in today's press release.\r\nIn addition, any forward-looking statement represent our estimates or views only as of today, March 25, 2015, and these views or estimates may change. While the company may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates or views do change. And therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our estimates or views as any date subsequent to today.\r\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Tom, and let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call. And I apologize for my voice. I have a bit of a cold, so hopefully, you can hear me all right.\r\nThe fourth quarter was a very strong finish for Red Hat, and our momentum is strong as we begin our new fiscal year. We exceeded guidance in virtually all of our financial metrics for the fourth quarter and drove a record total backlog for future revenue for FY '16 and beyond.\r\nThe fourth quarter was highlighted by subscription and total revenue that both grew more than 20% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Q4 was our highest quarterly growth rate in 3 years, cresting over the consistent mid- to high-teens growth level that we've delivered over that period. Demand for our open hybrid cloud technologies remained strong in the quarter, as evidenced by a record cross-selling in our top 30 deals, all of which were over $2 million, a first for us.\r\nOne of the primary drivers of our growth has been IT demand for technologies that bring consistency and flexibility to create applications across various deployment models, from bare metal to virtualization, to private and public clouds. We're able to help modernize our customers' existing applications while bringing transformative technologies like OpenShift and OpenStack to build stateless, highly scalable, native cloud applications. We bring consistency across these deployment models with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and our certified ecosystem.\r\nOur strategic position with customers, combined with our focus on continuous innovation and world-class customer support, allows us to increase our market share and wallet share. We see this in our renewals of our top 25 deals once again. Our customers not only renewed but increased their use of Red Hat technologies in their data centers. We renewed all 25 of those top 25 deals for the quarter and 100 out of the top 100 renewals reported for the fiscal year. In addition, the fourth quarter deals renewed at approximately 115% of their previous annualized value as customers continue to expand their relationship with us.\r\nLooking at the top 30 largest deals for the quarter. We saw continued strength in the size and breadth of technology, as we have seen for the past several quarters. Here are just a few of the highlights. First, as I mentioned, all of the top 30 deals not only were greater than $1 million, they all exceeded $2 million for the first time. One deal was over $10 million and 12 were over $5 million. Without getting the full fiscal year deals, we doubled the numbers of deals in both the $10 million and $5 million categories year-over-year.\r\nLooking at the industry breakout for the quarter by dollar representation. Financial services and tech and media had the largest representation in the top 30. Cross-selling was strong with a record 80% of the deals including one or more components from our application development and emerging technologies offerings, which include Middleware, OpenStack, OpenShift, CloudForms and Storage. In fact, the number of times the top 30 deals included OpenStack or OpenShift this quarter tripled from Q4 a year ago. Interestingly, one technology customer expanded their existing OpenShift deal this quarter, and we now have our first $10 million plus OpenShift customer.\r\nOpenShift has been performing well with customers and momentum is growing. This early traction with customers and the recent recognition of OpenShift as the InfoWorld 2015 Technology of the Year further validates the technology.\r\nNow let me hand the call over to Paul Cormier to update you on some of the progress we've made on our growth initiatives to offer a cohesive hybrid cloud solution for our customers in new markets.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Jim. And here are just a few highlights from the quarter. \r\nFirst, we launched RHEL Atomic Host, which provides a streamlined host platform that is optimized to run application containers. The software components included in RHEL Atomic have been designed to enhance the performance, scalability and security of containers while keeping the consistency of RHEL, creating a superior platform on which to deploy and run application containers. RHEL Atomic enables applications to be comprised of microservices in a container-based architecture to more fully realize the benefits of this more nimble, composable approach. Atomic provides numerous benefits to the container-based architecture, including container images in Docker format, Kubernetes orchestration and default security through SE Linux. Based on RHEL, the Atomic Host enables enterprises to embrace containers while reaping the benefits of deployment flexibility without sacrificing their performance, stability and security or the value of Red Hat's vast certified RHEL ecosystem.\r\nSecond, and in conjunction with the launch of RHEL Atomic, we announced the industry's first certified container ecosystem program to drive adoption of more secure, reliable, containerized applications based on RHEL and the Docker format. This partner program will offer Red Hat Container Certification to certify that a container's content is from a trusted source and that both the application and the container itself are free of identified vulnerabilities and will perform on Red Hat infrastructure, enabling a robust end-to-end solution that is supported by Red Hat and its partners. As customers consume Linux containers, we are leading the way in enabling them to enjoy the benefits of this key innovation without sacrificing the basic enterprise needs of application security and provenance, as we did in bringing RHEL Linux to the commercial world.\r\nThird, we continue to enhance our RHEL OpenStack platform technology with the launch of version 6, our second major commercial release in FY '15. RHEL OpenStack 6 platform adds over 700 enhancements and updates, all focused on improving the production-ready cloud platform for enterprise businesses, telecommunication companies and public cloud hosting providers. Building a co-engineered design with RHEL 7, RHEL OpenStack 6 platforms delivers new features aimed at easing enterprise deployments and administration within existing data centers, as well as capabilities specific to telecommunication providers to enable network functions virtualization or, as it's called, NFV.\r\nFourth, in February, we also deepened our strategic relationship with network and communications solution vendors to bring carrier-grade OpenStack solutions for NFV. Specifically, we expanded our partnership with NEC, a leading provider of communications solutions and a top 10 OpenStack contributor. We will be jointly developing NFV features in the integration of the RHEL OpenStack platform. This partnership expands our portfolio of top global NFV vendors looking to achieve carrier-grade OpenStack solutions for NFV as this technology moves from proof of concepts to pilots to production.\r\nIn summary, our focused engineering and support efforts in FY '15 have broadened our portfolio of commercial technologies. When combined with strong sales execution, Red Hat delivered high revenue growth and record total backlog. This company-wide execution has increased our strategic position with customers as we look to further expand our market share.\r\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Charlie.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Paul. I'm also pleased to report a great fourth quarter. It seems an appropriate finish to a very strong fiscal year. Demand for our growing portfolio of open hybrid cloud offerings was very good. But as Paul said, it was the excellent execution on the part of our Red Hat associates and partners which resulted in a compelling combination of revenue growth, profitability and cash flow for the quarter and the fiscal year. We exceeded guidance and outperformed on virtually all financial metrics in U.S. dollars despite very significant foreign exchange headwinds during the quarter.\r\nHowever, foreign exchange rates are important, and I want to update you on the foreign exchange impact to our business before I jump into the quarterly details. Virtually every company that has reported since December has commented on the impact of foreign currencies, including Oracle just last week. The rapid devaluation of nearly every foreign currency versus the U.S. dollar is not news. Yet surprisingly, only about 30% of the sell-side analysts who follow Red Hat have updated their models at current rates. Nearly every currency in which we do business weakened against the U.S. dollar when compared to Q4 last year, last quarter, against guidance or versus the full year fiscal '14. So if you want additional currency rate detail, please see the rates which are posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. These rate changes negatively impacted both the results for the quarter and for the full year across the income statement, the balance sheet and the off-balance sheet backlog.\r\nSo for instance, total revenue for the fourth quarter, which was very good, would have been $24 million higher using Q4 rates from last year, $13 million higher using rates from last quarter and $7 million higher using rates that I used in December for guidance. For the full fiscal year 2015, total revenue would have been $36 million higher using rates from last year and $20 million higher using the rates given in March of 2014, when we first set fiscal year 2015 guidance.\r\nAs a result of this foreign exchange volatility, I will provide both U.S. dollar and constant currency results using the rates from Q4 last year and from the fiscal year '14. Here are just a few of the financial highlights on a year-over-year basis. Full year revenue was up 19% in constant currency and 17% in U.S. dollars. Full year non-GAAP operating income grew 11%, reflecting our continued investment in emerging technologies, including investments made in 3 acquired companies. We hit new record highs for both quarterly and annual operating cash flow. For the quarter, we exceeded the $200 million mark, coming in at $217 million, up 18%. For the full year, we exceeded the $600 million mark with full year operating cash flow of $623 million, up 15%, while at the same time, our total backlog grew by more than 19% year-over-year in U.S. dollars.\r\nAs I have done on other year-end calls, I will add a few additional statistics about bookings. But also consistent with prior years, we will not be updating these booking statistics on a quarterly basis. First, as I indicated, total backlog was up over 19% year-over-year at February 28 to over $1.86 billion. We define total backlog as total deferred revenue which is billed, plus the value of customer contracts to be billed in the future not reflected in our financial statements. Total deferred revenue was $1.5 billion at the end of fiscal 2015. It's up 15% year-over-year. A portion of total backlog to be billed in the future, or sometimes it's referred to as off-balance sheet backlog, was in excess of $380 million compared to in excess of $270 million last fiscal year, up over 40% year-over-year. It is worth noting that the portion of the off-balance sheet backlog to be billed the next 12 months was in excess of $230 million, up approximately $40 million or 21% from fiscal 2014.\r\nThese results reflect a strong mix of business across technologies and geographies. The combination of deferred revenue and off-balance sheet backlog to be billed in the next 12 months gives us good forward visibility into a significant portion of fiscal '16 revenue and some for the following years. The increase in longer-term visibility was driven by strong sales execution and a number of large renewals that extended their size and terms. This led to bookings duration of 22 months for fiscal '15, slightly above our normal 21-month average.\r\nMoving on to bookings by channel and geography. Our Q4 bookings mix was 68% from the channel and 32% from direct sales. This is similar to our annual mix of channel versus direct sales, and this mix split for the channel is up 500 basis points from last fiscal year and moving closer to our multi-year goal of 70%, 30% split of channel and direct sales.\r\nOur quarterly geographic split of bookings was 63% from the Americas, 25% from EMEA and 12% from APAC compared to a split in Q4 last year of 61%, 26% and 13%, respectively. All regions performed well and delivered double-digit growth year-over-year despite the foreign exchange headwinds.\r\nNow let's talk about our financial performance for the quarter, starting with the revenue. Fourth quarter revenue was $464 million. It's up 22% in constant currency from the prior year and 16% in U.S. dollars. This result was above the top end of our U.S. dollar guidance despite a $7 million foreign exchange headwind from guidance rates.\r\nSubscription revenue, which is a renewable revenue stream, constituted approximately 87% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $405 million. It's up 21% in constant currency from the prior year and 15% in U.S. dollars.\r\nHere's a breakdown of revenue by technology in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $341 million, accelerating the 17% growth in constant currency and 12% in U.S. dollars year-over-year. Subscription revenue for application development and emerging technologies offerings was $64 million, up year-over-year 45% in constant currency and 38% in U.S. dollars. As a reminder, our infrastructure-related offerings include mainly Red Hat Enterprise Linux, RHEL and RHEL-related offerings and RHEV, while our application development and emerging technology offerings include Middleware, OpenStack, OpenShift, CloudForms and Storage.\r\nThe fourth quarter represented the first time that our application development and emerging technologies offerings surpassed the annualized subscription revenue level of $0.25 billion, that's billion with a B, another validation of the success of our product strategy.\r\nTraining and services revenue was $59 million. It's up 28% in constant currency and 20% in U.S. dollars from the year-ago period, turning in a very strong performance.\r\nNow I'll discuss the rest of our results on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation, amortization expense, business acquisition-related costs and noncash interest expense related to the convertible debt. Overall gross margin was 86% for Q4, up 30 basis points sequentially and in line with the prior year. Subscription gross margin was consistent with last quarter and last year at 94%. Training and services gross margin was 33%. That's 130 basis points better than Q4 last year as a result of better-than-expected utilization in the fourth quarter holiday period this year.\r\nFor Q4, non-GAAP operating expense was $289 million. It's up 2% sequentially and up 17% in U.S. dollars from the prior year. We added over 150 new employees in the quarter, mainly investing in sales, support and engineering skills needed to drive our emerging technologies. For the fiscal year, we increased our headcount by about 950 people with approximately 1/4 of the new associates coming from our 3 acquisitions, that is Inktank, eNovance and FeedHenry, which brought additional capabilities and skills in software-defined storage, OpenStack and mobility.\r\nQ4 non-GAAP operating income of $111 million increased 14% from last year, resulting in a Q4 non-GAAP operating margin of 23.8%, 80 basis points better than guidance. Net interest income and other income was $5.8 million. This result included a onetime investment gain of nearly $5 million or $0.02 per share.\r\nThe annual effective tax rate was approximately 29.5% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results, which was slightly higher than the 29% which we estimated in December. As a result, the Q4 tax rate was 30.7% in order to adjust this to the annual rate, which had a negative impact of $0.01 per share on the Q4 earnings per share.\r\nOur non-GAAP diluted quarterly earnings per share is $0.43 compared to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.39 in Q4 of last year. The Q4 result is $0.02 per share better than the top of our guidance. The $0.01 per share is primarily due to the revenue beat, and $0.01 per share is better below the line, as I just mentioned.\r\nNow let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the year with just over $1.8 billion in cash and investments. As part of our capital allocation plans, we completed the $375 million accelerated stock repurchase program in Q4. Combining this ASR with the $160 million we repurchased earlier in the year, we have repurchased a total of $535 million or 9.1 million shares of Red Hat stock this year. Over the last 4 years, we have repurchased over $1 billion in Red Hat shares.\r\nAlong with today's Q4 announcement, I'm pleased to announce that Red Hat's Board of Directors has authorized a new $500 million repurchase program to replace the remainder of the previous $300 million authorization that expires later this month. Given our long-term growth prospects, our management team and the board believe that returning capital to investors through stock repurchases will create additional value for our shareholders.\r\nOur days sales outstanding was 63 days at year-end compared to 58 days last year. Very strong Q4 volume drove the DSO change, which we would expect to move back to its 60 days next quarter. And as a reminder, since day sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables versus billings, our DSO calculation is based on our billings proxy, which includes revenue plus the change in deferred revenue from the cash flow statement.\r\nTotal deferred revenue at quarter-end was $1.48 billion, in -- that's U.S. dollars, an increase of $193 million or 15% over the prior year-end. Sequentially, deferred revenue increased approximately $182 million or 14% from last quarter. \r\nAs one would expect, foreign exchange had a large impact. So I'm going to break down the components of deferred revenue to highlight the impact of the currency changes. Short-term deferred revenue, which ended Q3 at $941 million, had real growth in Q4 of $181 million but decreased $27 million as a result of changes in the FX spot rates, ending Q4 over $1.09 billion. Long-term deferred revenue, which ended Q3 at $359 million, had a real increase in Q4 of approximately $44 million but decreased $16 million due to changes in FX spot rates, ending Q4 at $387 million. The total increase in deferred revenue without the impact of currency changes was $225 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows.\r\nMoving to the statement of cash flows. We produced record quarterly operating cash flow of $217 million, up 18% year-over-year. Full year operating cash flow was $623 million. That's up 15% and it's well above the top of our guidance. This overachievement was driven by strong billings and strong collections.\r\nNow to briefly recap and summarize just a few highlights for the full fiscal year. Revenue grew to $1.79 billion, up 19% year-over-year in constant currency or up 17% in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue grew to $1.56 billion, an increase of 19% in constant currency or 17% in U.S. dollars. And subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $1.32 billion. It's up 15% in constant currency and 13% in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for application development and emerging technologies was $237 million, up 45% in constant currency and 43% in U.S. dollars. For fiscal '15, application development and emerging technology subscriptions now constitutes 13% of total revenue, up from 11% last fiscal year. \r\nNon-GAAP operating income grew by 11%, which includes the dilutive impact from the 3 strategic acquisitions which we closed during the year. Non-GAAP EPS for the full year was $1.60, up 7% over the prior year. And the differences in the tax rate played a part in that.\r\nOverall, it was another great year with strong execution across all areas of the business. Now I want to shift to fiscal year 2016 guidance.\r\nFor this guidance, I have assumed average foreign exchange rates of $1.08 for the euro and $1 -- excuse me, and JPY 121 to the dollar. Compared to the year just finished, this represents a 20% weakening of the euro and an 11% weakening of the yen, with the largest impact coming in the first 3 quarters. Most other global currencies have also devalued in this range, some even greater. As in the past, I'm not attempting to forecast exchange rates. I'm simply pegging guidance at recent rates for a point of reference. The coming year is one in which virtually everyone with foreign operations will be measuring performance in constant currency terms until rates stabilize and cycle through a full year.\r\nWe are forecasting annual revenue growth in constant currency terms up to 19%. The FX rates which I am using create a headwind to revenue in U.S. dollars of approximately $110 million or 600 basis points. The headwind is $110 million or 600 hundred basis points. Therefore, we are forecasting total revenue in the range of $1.99 billion to $2.02 billion -- so maybe 1990 to 2020, easy way to remember it -- for fiscal 2016, representing approximately 13% growth in U.S. dollars at the top of the range.\r\nFor modeling purposes, our growth rate assumes that subscription revenues grow 20% in constant currency and services revenue will flow to 13% in constant currency as the initial training surge associated with the release of RHEL 7 hits the 1-year anniversary. We're also assuming that OpenStack services will continue to expand in fiscal '16 due to high interest in our offering.\r\nOur operating margin forecast reflects our plan to continue investing in emerging technologies as well as the full year impact of the 3 acquisitions we completed this last fiscal year. We are planning to keep operating margins consistent with last year, or around 23.3%, and continue to invest for growth, particularly around OpenStack, OpenShift, cloud management and software-defined storage. I'm estimating full year other income, principally net interest income, of approximately $8 million or $2 million per quarter, which includes the cash interest expense from the convertible debt.\r\nThe estimated annual effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2016 remains at 29% for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. Assuming a 29% tax rate and approximately 186 million diluted shares, one would estimate diluted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.79 to $1.82 per share. \r\nOn a GAAP basis, we estimate annual stock compensation expense of approximately $160 million and annual amortization expense of approximately $26 million. From a cash flow perspective, we anticipate operating cash flow for the full year between $670 million to $690 million. Further, we are forecasting CapEx of approximately $50 million, in line with fiscal '15.\r\nFinally, as we have seen over the last several years with the recurring revenue model, there's a natural ebb and flow to the business from quarter-to-quarter. Bookings and billings historically are lowest in the first quarter and have grown each quarter to the fourth quarter, and to then repeat the pattern again the following year. We would expect the same this year.\r\nFor those of you who look to model deferred revenue, we would suggest you focus on the larger short-term deferred revenue portion, as we would expect bookings duration to return to something closer to 21 months and bring the long-term deferred revenue more in line with revenue than short-term deferred growth.\r\nFor Q1, keep in mind that the average euro rate a year ago, that's Q1 a year ago, was $1.38, and there were JPY 102 to the dollar, both weakening considerably. With that reminder, we offer the following guidance. Revenue is estimated to grow approximately 20% in constant currencies to a range of $469 million to $474 million or 12% in U.S. dollars at the top of the range. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 22% as a result of the timing this year of major sales and marketing events globally. With other income of $2 million and a 29% tax rate, our non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be around $0.41 a share, assuming approximately 186 million diluted shares. Consistent with my past practice, I do not guide quarterly cash flow because it can be quite variable depending upon individual large payments or receipts. However, I'd say it seems likely that the multi-year pattern of higher cash flow in Q1 than Q2 will repeat given our strong year-end balance sheet.\r\nIn summary, we had a great fiscal year. We believe that we're well positioned for further growth and profitability in 2016 and beyond by leveraging the emerging technologies that continue to gain traction with customers and are growing rapidly. The larger deals driven by strong renewals and upsell have strengthened our strategic position with customers and a record total backlog that provides even better forward visibility and one of the fast-growing set of core platform and middleware technologies in the industry. Our growth drivers look good.\r\nI also want to reaffirm what I said on the third quarter call for those who missed it. It was this, and it applies today, the company has never been better positioned for the future than it is right now. Our portfolio of open source infrastructure software and services has never been broader or more current. All major product lines have been refreshed this year, meaning in the last 12 months. The company is well staffed and well managed, and the world is embracing open source software like never before. With Red Hat as the undisputed leader of open source, the future has never been brighter.\r\nSo on a final note, I hope that many of you will be able to join us on June 24 at Analyst Day at the Red Hat Summit in Boston. It's going to be a great opportunity to learn more about our strategy, innovation and customer focus. And if you're not able to attend in person, we hope you'll be able to join our live webcast, where you can access all the information that we present.\r\nAnd operator, I'd like to turn it back to you now for the first question.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nThank you, Rich. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Red Hat's earnings call for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Speakers for today's call will be Jim Whitehurst, President and CEO; Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Paul Cormier, Executive Vice President of Products and Technology.\r\nOur press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from redhat.com on the Investor Relations page. Also on this page, you'll be able to find a historic reconciliation schedule of GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics as well as a schedule on currency rates.\r\nVarious remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans, prospects, including statements containing the words believe, anticipate, plan, project, estimate, expect, intend or will, constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

And I apologize for my voice. I have a bit of a cold, so hopefully, you can hear me all right.\r\nThe fourth quarter was a very strong finish for Red Hat, and our momentum is strong as we begin our new fiscal year. We exceeded guidance in virtually all of our financial metrics for the fourth quarter and drove a record total backlog for future revenue for FY '16 and beyond.\r\nThe fourth quarter was highlighted by subscription and total revenue that both grew more than 20% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Q4 was our highest quarterly growth rate in 3 years, cresting over the consistent mid- to high-teens growth level that we've delivered over that period. Demand for our open hybrid cloud technologies remained strong in the quarter, as evidenced by a record cross-selling in our top 30 deals, all of which were over $2 million, a first for us.\r\nOne of the primary drivers of our growth has been IT demand for technologies that bring consistency and flexibility to create applications across various deployment models, from bare metal to virtualization, to private and public clouds. We're able to help modernize our customers' existing applications while bringing transformative technologies like OpenShift and OpenStack to build stateless, highly scalable, native cloud applications. We bring consistency across these deployment models with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and our certified ecosystem.\r\nOur strategic position with customers, combined with our focus on continuous innovation and world-class customer support, allows us to increase our market share and wallet share. We see this in our renewals of our top 25 deals once again. Our customers not only renewed but increased their use of Red Hat technologies in their data centers. We renewed all 25 of those top 25 deals for the quarter and 100 out of the top 100 renewals reported for the fiscal year. In addition, the fourth quarter deals renewed at approximately 115% of their previous annualized value as customers continue to expand their relationship with us.\r\nLooking at the top 30 largest deals for the quarter. We saw continued strength in the size and breadth of technology, as we have seen for the past several quarters. Here are just a few of the highlights. First, as I mentioned, all of the top 30 deals not only were greater than $1 million, they all exceeded $2 million for the first time. One deal was over $10 million and 12 were over $5 million. Without getting the full fiscal year deals, we doubled the numbers of deals in both the $10 million and $5 million categories year-over-year.\r\nLooking at the industry breakout for the quarter by dollar representation. Financial services and tech and media had the largest representation in the top 30. Cross-selling was strong with a record 80% of the deals including one or more components from our application development and emerging technologies offerings, which include Middleware, OpenStack, OpenShift, CloudForms and Storage. In fact, the number of times the top 30 deals included OpenStack or OpenShift this quarter tripled from Q4 a year ago. Interestingly, one technology customer expanded their existing OpenShift deal this quarter, and we now have our first $10 million plus OpenShift customer.\r\nOpenShift has been performing well with customers and momentum is growing. This early traction with customers and the recent recognition of OpenShift as the InfoWorld 2015 Technology of the Year further validates the technology.\r\nNow let me hand the call over to Paul Cormier to update you on some of the progress we've made on our growth initiatives to offer a cohesive hybrid cloud solution for our customers in new markets.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Paul Cormier (Executives)】\nThank you, Jim. And here are just a few highlights from the quarter. \r\nFirst, we launched RHEL Atomic Host, which provides a streamlined host platform that is optimized to run application containers. The software components included in RHEL Atomic have been designed to enhance the performance, scalability and security of containers while keeping the consistency of RHEL, creating a superior platform on which to deploy and run application containers. RHEL Atomic enables applications to be comprised of microservices in a container-based architecture to more fully realize the benefits of this more nimble, composable approach. Atomic provides numerous benefits to the container-based architecture, including container images in Docker format, Kubernetes orchestration and default security through SE Linux. Based on RHEL, the Atomic Host enables enterprises to embrace containers while reaping the benefits of deployment flexibility without sacrificing their performance, stability and security or the value of Red Hat's vast certified RHEL ecosystem.\r\nSecond, and in conjunction with the launch of RHEL Atomic, we announced the industry's first certified container ecosystem program to drive adoption of more secure, reliable, containerized applications based on RHEL and the Docker format. This partner program will offer Red Hat Container Certification to certify that a container's content is from a trusted source and that both the application and the container itself are free of identified vulnerabilities and will perform on Red Hat infrastructure, enabling a robust end-to-end solution that is supported by Red Hat and its partners. As customers consume Linux containers, we are leading the way in enabling them to enjoy the benefits of this key innovation without sacrificing the basic enterprise needs of application security and provenance, as we did in bringing RHEL Linux to the commercial world.\r\nThird, we continue to enhance our RHEL OpenStack platform technology with the launch of version 6, our second major commercial release in FY '15. RHEL OpenStack 6 platform adds over 700 enhancements and updates, all focused on improving the production-ready cloud platform for enterprise businesses, telecommunication companies and public cloud hosting providers. Building a co-engineered design with RHEL 7, RHEL OpenStack 6 platforms delivers new features aimed at easing enterprise deployments and administration within existing data centers, as well as capabilities specific to telecommunication providers to enable network functions virtualization or, as it's called, NFV.\r\nFourth, in February, we also deepened our strategic relationship with network and communications solution vendors to bring carrier-grade OpenStack solutions for NFV. Specifically, we expanded our partnership with NEC, a leading provider of communications solutions and a top 10 OpenStack contributor. We will be jointly developing NFV features in the integration of the RHEL OpenStack platform. This partnership expands our portfolio of top global NFV vendors looking to achieve carrier-grade OpenStack solutions for NFV as this technology moves from proof of concepts to pilots to production.\r\nIn summary, our focused engineering and support efforts in FY '15 have broadened our portfolio of commercial technologies. When combined with strong sales execution, Red Hat delivered high revenue growth and record total backlog. This company-wide execution has increased our strategic position with customers as we look to further expand our market share.\r\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Charlie.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nThanks, Paul. I'm also pleased to report a great fourth quarter. It seems an appropriate finish to a very strong fiscal year. Demand for our growing portfolio of open hybrid cloud offerings was very good. But as Paul said, it was the excellent execution on the part of our Red Hat associates and partners which resulted in a compelling combination of revenue growth, profitability and cash flow for the quarter and the fiscal year. We exceeded guidance and outperformed on virtually all financial metrics in U.S. dollars despite very significant foreign exchange headwinds during the quarter.\r\nHowever, foreign exchange rates are important, and I want to update you on the foreign exchange impact to our business before I jump into the quarterly details. Virtually every company that has reported since December has commented on the impact of foreign currencies, including Oracle just last week. The rapid devaluation of nearly every foreign currency versus the U.S. dollar is not news. Yet surprisingly, only about 30% of the sell-side analysts who follow Red Hat have updated their models at current rates. Nearly every currency in which we do business weakened against the U.S. dollar when compared to Q4 last year, last quarter, against guidance or versus the full year fiscal '14. So if you want additional currency rate detail, please see the rates which are posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. These rate changes negatively impacted both the results for the quarter and for the full year across the income statement, the balance sheet and the off-balance sheet backlog.\r\nSo for instance, total revenue for the fourth quarter, which was very good, would have been $24 million higher using Q4 rates from last year, $13 million higher using rates from last quarter and $7 million higher using rates that I used in December for guidance. For the full fiscal year 2015, total revenue would have been $36 million higher using rates from last year and $20 million higher using the rates given in March of 2014, when we first set fiscal year 2015 guidance.\r\nAs a result of this foreign exchange volatility, I will provide both U.S. dollar and constant currency results using the rates from Q4 last year and from the fiscal year '14. Here are just a few of the financial highlights on a year-over-year basis. Full year revenue was up 19% in constant currency and 17% in U.S. dollars. Full year non-GAAP operating income grew 11%, reflecting our continued investment in emerging technologies, including investments made in 3 acquired companies. We hit new record highs for both quarterly and annual operating cash flow. For the quarter, we exceeded the $200 million mark, coming in at $217 million, up 18%. For the full year, we exceeded the $600 million mark with full year operating cash flow of $623 million, up 15%, while at the same time, our total backlog grew by more than 19% year-over-year in U.S. dollars.\r\nAs I have done on other year-end calls, I will add a few additional statistics about bookings. But also consistent with prior years, we will not be updating these booking statistics on a quarterly basis. First, as I indicated, total backlog was up over 19% year-over-year at February 28 to over $1.86 billion. We define total backlog as total deferred revenue which is billed, plus the value of customer contracts to be billed in the future not reflected in our financial statements. Total deferred revenue was $1.5 billion at the end of fiscal 2015. It's up 15% year-over-year. A portion of total backlog to be billed in the future, or sometimes it's referred to as off-balance sheet backlog, was in excess of $380 million compared to in excess of $270 million last fiscal year, up over 40% year-over-year. It is worth noting that the portion of the off-balance sheet backlog to be billed the next 12 months was in excess of $230 million, up approximately $40 million or 21% from fiscal 2014.\r\nThese results reflect a strong mix of business across technologies and geographies. The combination of deferred revenue and off-balance sheet backlog to be billed in the next 12 months gives us good forward visibility into a significant portion of fiscal '16 revenue and some for the following years. The increase in longer-term visibility was driven by strong sales execution and a number of large renewals that extended their size and terms. This led to bookings duration of 22 months for fiscal '15, slightly above our normal 21-month average.\r\nMoving on to bookings by channel and geography. Our Q4 bookings mix was 68% from the channel and 32% from direct sales. This is similar to our annual mix of channel versus direct sales, and this mix split for the channel is up 500 basis points from last fiscal year and moving closer to our multi-year goal of 70%, 30% split of channel and direct sales.\r\nOur quarterly geographic split of bookings was 63% from the Americas, 25% from EMEA and 12% from APAC compared to a split in Q4 last year of 61%, 26% and 13%, respectively. All regions performed well and delivered double-digit growth year-over-year despite the foreign exchange headwinds.\r\nNow let's talk about our financial performance for the quarter, starting with the revenue. Fourth quarter revenue was $464 million. It's up 22% in constant currency from the prior year and 16% in U.S. dollars. This result was above the top end of our U.S. dollar guidance despite a $7 million foreign exchange headwind from guidance rates.\r\nSubscription revenue, which is a renewable revenue stream, constituted approximately 87% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $405 million. It's up 21% in constant currency from the prior year and 15% in U.S. dollars.\r\nHere's a breakdown of revenue by technology in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $341 million, accelerating the 17% growth in constant currency and 12% in U.S. dollars year-over-year. Subscription revenue for application development and emerging technologies offerings was $64 million, up year-over-year 45% in constant currency and 38% in U.S. dollars. As a reminder, our infrastructure-related offerings include mainly Red Hat Enterprise Linux, RHEL and RHEL-related offerings and RHEV, while our application development and emerging technology offerings include Middleware, OpenStack, OpenShift, CloudForms and Storage.\r\nThe fourth quarter represented the first time that our application development and emerging technologies offerings surpassed the annualized subscription revenue level of $0.25 billion, that's billion with a B, another validation of the success of our product strategy.\r\nTraining and services revenue was $59 million. It's up 28% in constant currency and 20% in U.S. dollars from the year-ago period, turning in a very strong performance.\r\nNow I'll discuss the rest of our results on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation, amortization expense, business acquisition-related costs and noncash interest expense related to the convertible debt. Overall gross margin was 86% for Q4, up 30 basis points sequentially and in line with the prior year. Subscription gross margin was consistent with last quarter and last year at 94%. Training and services gross margin was 33%. That's 130 basis points better than Q4 last year as a result of better-than-expected utilization in the fourth quarter holiday period this year.\r\nFor Q4, non-GAAP operating expense was $289 million. It's up 2% sequentially and up 17% in U.S. dollars from the prior year. We added over 150 new employees in the quarter, mainly investing in sales, support and engineering skills needed to drive our emerging technologies. For the fiscal year, we increased our headcount by about 950 people with approximately 1/4 of the new associates coming from our 3 acquisitions, that is Inktank, eNovance and FeedHenry, which brought additional capabilities and skills in software-defined storage, OpenStack and mobility.\r\nQ4 non-GAAP operating income of $111 million increased 14% from last year, resulting in a Q4 non-GAAP operating margin of 23.8%, 80 basis points better than guidance. Net interest income and other income was $5.8 million. This result included a onetime investment gain of nearly $5 million or $0.02 per share.\r\nThe annual effective tax rate was approximately 29.5% for both GAAP and non-GAAP results, which was slightly higher than the 29% which we estimated in December. As a result, the Q4 tax rate was 30.7% in order to adjust this to the annual rate, which had a negative impact of $0.01 per share on the Q4 earnings per share.\r\nOur non-GAAP diluted quarterly earnings per share is $0.43 compared to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.39 in Q4 of last year. The Q4 result is $0.02 per share better than the top of our guidance. The $0.01 per share is primarily due to the revenue beat, and $0.01 per share is better below the line, as I just mentioned.\r\nNow let's turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We ended the year with just over $1.8 billion in cash and investments. As part of our capital allocation plans, we completed the $375 million accelerated stock repurchase program in Q4. Combining this ASR with the $160 million we repurchased earlier in the year, we have repurchased a total of $535 million or 9.1 million shares of Red Hat stock this year. Over the last 4 years, we have repurchased over $1 billion in Red Hat shares.\r\nAlong with today's Q4 announcement, I'm pleased to announce that Red Hat's Board of Directors has authorized a new $500 million repurchase program to replace the remainder of the previous $300 million authorization that expires later this month. Given our long-term growth prospects, our management team and the board believe that returning capital to investors through stock repurchases will create additional value for our shareholders.\r\nOur days sales outstanding was 63 days at year-end compared to 58 days last year. Very strong Q4 volume drove the DSO change, which we would expect to move back to its 60 days next quarter. And as a reminder, since day sales outstanding is traditionally a measure of receivables versus billings, our DSO calculation is based on our billings proxy, which includes revenue plus the change in deferred revenue from the cash flow statement.\r\nTotal deferred revenue at quarter-end was $1.48 billion, in -- that's U.S. dollars, an increase of $193 million or 15% over the prior year-end. Sequentially, deferred revenue increased approximately $182 million or 14% from last quarter. \r\nAs one would expect, foreign exchange had a large impact. So I'm going to break down the components of deferred revenue to highlight the impact of the currency changes. Short-term deferred revenue, which ended Q3 at $941 million, had real growth in Q4 of $181 million but decreased $27 million as a result of changes in the FX spot rates, ending Q4 over $1.09 billion. Long-term deferred revenue, which ended Q3 at $359 million, had a real increase in Q4 of approximately $44 million but decreased $16 million due to changes in FX spot rates, ending Q4 at $387 million. The total increase in deferred revenue without the impact of currency changes was $225 million and can be found on our statement of cash flows.\r\nMoving to the statement of cash flows. We produced record quarterly operating cash flow of $217 million, up 18% year-over-year. Full year operating cash flow was $623 million. That's up 15% and it's well above the top of our guidance. This overachievement was driven by strong billings and strong collections.\r\nNow to briefly recap and summarize just a few highlights for the full fiscal year. Revenue grew to $1.79 billion, up 19% year-over-year in constant currency or up 17% in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue grew to $1.56 billion, an increase of 19% in constant currency or 17% in U.S. dollars. And subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $1.32 billion. It's up 15% in constant currency and 13% in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for application development and emerging technologies was $237 million, up 45% in constant currency and 43% in U.S. dollars. For fiscal '15, application development and emerging technology subscriptions now constitutes 13% of total revenue, up from 11% last fiscal year. \r\nNon-GAAP operating income grew by 11%, which includes the dilutive impact from the 3 strategic acquisitions which we closed during the year. Non-GAAP EPS for the full year was $1.60, up 7% over the prior year. And the differences in the tax rate played a part in that.\r\nOverall, it was another great year with strong execution across all areas of the business. Now I want to shift to fiscal year 2016 guidance.\r\nFor this guidance, I have assumed average foreign exchange rates of $1.08 for the euro and $1 -- excuse me, and JPY 121 to the dollar. Compared to the year just finished, this represents a 20% weakening of the euro and an 11% weakening of the yen, with the largest impact coming in the first 3 quarters. Most other global currencies have also devalued in this range, some even greater. As in the past, I'm not attempting to forecast exchange rates. I'm simply pegging guidance at recent rates for a point of reference. The coming year is one in which virtually everyone with foreign operations will be measuring performance in constant currency terms until rates stabilize and cycle through a full year.\r\nWe are forecasting annual revenue growth in constant currency terms up to 19%. The FX rates which I am using create a headwind to revenue in U.S. dollars of approximately $110 million or 600 basis points. The headwind is $110 million or 600 hundred basis points. Therefore, we are forecasting total revenue in the range of $1.99 billion to $2.02 billion -- so maybe 1990 to 2020, easy way to remember it -- for fiscal 2016, representing approximately 13% growth in U.S. dollars at the top of the range.\r\nFor modeling purposes, our growth rate assumes that subscription revenues grow 20% in constant currency and services revenue will flow to 13% in constant currency as the initial training surge associated with the release of RHEL 7 hits the 1-year anniversary. We're also assuming that OpenStack services will continue to expand in fiscal '16 due to high interest in our offering.\r\nOur operating margin forecast reflects our plan to continue investing in emerging technologies as well as the full year impact of the 3 acquisitions we completed this last fiscal year. We are planning to keep operating margins consistent with last year, or around 23.3%, and continue to invest for growth, particularly around OpenStack, OpenShift, cloud management and software-defined storage. I'm estimating full year other income, principally net interest income, of approximately $8 million or $2 million per quarter, which includes the cash interest expense from the convertible debt.\r\nThe estimated annual effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2016 remains at 29% for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. Assuming a 29% tax rate and approximately 186 million diluted shares, one would estimate diluted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.79 to $1.82 per share. \r\nOn a GAAP basis, we estimate annual stock compensation expense of approximately $160 million and annual amortization expense of approximately $26 million. From a cash flow perspective, we anticipate operating cash flow for the full year between $670 million to $690 million. Further, we are forecasting CapEx of approximately $50 million, in line with fiscal '15.\r\nFinally, as we have seen over the last several years with the recurring revenue model, there's a natural ebb and flow to the business from quarter-to-quarter. Bookings and billings historically are lowest in the first quarter and have grown each quarter to the fourth quarter, and to then repeat the pattern again the following year. We would expect the same this year.\r\nFor those of you who look to model deferred revenue, we would suggest you focus on the larger short-term deferred revenue portion, as we would expect bookings duration to return to something closer to 21 months and bring the long-term deferred revenue more in line with revenue than short-term deferred growth.\r\nFor Q1, keep in mind that the average euro rate a year ago, that's Q1 a year ago, was $1.38, and there were JPY 102 to the dollar, both weakening considerably. With that reminder, we offer the following guidance. Revenue is estimated to grow approximately 20% in constant currencies to a range of $469 million to $474 million or 12% in U.S. dollars at the top of the range. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 22% as a result of the timing this year of major sales and marketing events globally. With other income of $2 million and a 29% tax rate, our non-GAAP EPS is estimated to be around $0.41 a share, assuming approximately 186 million diluted shares. Consistent with my past practice, I do not guide quarterly cash flow because it can be quite variable depending upon individual large payments or receipts. However, I'd say it seems likely that the multi-year pattern of higher cash flow in Q1 than Q2 will repeat given our strong year-end balance sheet.\r\nIn summary, we had a great fiscal year. We believe that we're well positioned for further growth and profitability in 2016 and beyond by leveraging the emerging technologies that continue to gain traction with customers and are growing rapidly. The larger deals driven by strong renewals and upsell have strengthened our strategic position with customers and a record total backlog that provides even better forward visibility and one of the fast-growing set of core platform and middleware technologies in the industry. Our growth drivers look good.\r\nI also want to reaffirm what I said on the third quarter call for those who missed it. It was this, and it applies today, the company has never been better positioned for the future than it is right now. Our portfolio of open source infrastructure software and services has never been broader or more current. All major product lines have been refreshed this year, meaning in the last 12 months. The company is well staffed and well managed, and the world is embracing open source software like never before. With Red Hat as the undisputed leader of open source, the future has never been brighter.\r\nSo on a final note, I hope that many of you will be able to join us on June 24 at Analyst Day at the Red Hat Summit in Boston. It's going to be a great opportunity to learn more about our strategy, innovation and customer focus. And if you're not able to attend in person, we hope you'll be able to join our live webcast, where you can access all the information that we present.\r\nAnd operator, I'd like to turn it back to you now for the first question.",
      "transcript_text3": "I just wanted to follow up -- and nice quarter, guys -- with some comments that Paul made talking about Atomic and talking about OpenStack. I was just wondering if you could share with us kind of how you characterize kind of the biggest pain points that customers are facing right now as they look at these technologies to help them. And kind of what are the things that are left that you'd like -- the heavy lifting that needs to get done for adoption to really even take off further than where you're seeing it today, for people go from pilots into more hard-core production?\n\n---\n\nHeather, this is Paul. We're seeing that adoption today, I mean, as Charlie indicated in the numbers. But I think the thing we're concentrating on is, just as we did with Linux moving to RHEL, is installation, configuration and management around the code itself. So making it more consumable to the masses. That's frankly what we do with open source.\n\n---\n\nIt seems remarkable. This was the toughest billings comparison in 2 years, and it was combined with the worst FX impact you've had in probably 5 or 10 years. But you still reported an acceleration in billings growth to 22%. And so in terms of what is driving that, I was wondering if you could comment on one of the potential new tailwinds in particular, which is security and the view that Linux is more secure than Windows. I was wondering if perhaps you could touch on the demand environment for your SE Linux product, maybe why open source is the more secure development model and perhaps how the Heartbleed and Shellshock viruses might be driving strength or demand in your core business.\n\n---\n\nMark, it's Paul. I mean, in general, the development model of open source is, we feel, a very secure way to develop software because you get a lot of eyes on it. But having said that, once it's out into products, the community doesn't take it from there, and that's where we come in. The life cycle that we give with all our products, starting with RHEL, is what customers depend on and how to get those security updates in a timely fashion. I mean, it's exactly what we're doing with containers as well because it's the same scenario as we've had with all our products. That life cycle, the update, the security updates, that's a crucial part of the subscription that customers get on all our products, and that's what's a big critical need for them.\n\n---\n\nOne of the things that's driving Free to Pay fairly significantly is -- again, people start with free, but when you start thinking about security, needing updates, the major -- Shellshock, Heartbleed, our customers were covered within hours with patches we distribute. That was not true for people on free.\n\n---\n\nThere are 3 different metrics. You've got revenue and you've got the change in deferred revenue and you've got the change in backlog. The change in backlog obviously seems to be the widest, especially when I look at the emerging technologies, non-infrastructure piece. Could you maybe give us some rank ordering of where you're seeing the biggest growth in your off-balance sheet backlog? It's going from $270 million to $380 million. Looking at the income statement, it looks like anything non-infrastructure related was up roughly $60 million, $70 million or so, but the backlog itself grew a lot more than that. So my question is the delta changed. Where is the growth in the off-balance sheet backlog disproportionately coming relative to the growth you're seeing in the income statement and even in the reported deferred revenue? And if you can, finally, touch upon the Windows 2003 Server refresh and any opportunities for Red Hat, that will be great. And I apologize for the length of the question.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thanks, Kash. I would be disappointed if it wasn't a multipart question. Backlog, this comment on backlog was very strong selling activity and expansion with existing customers and the many new customers and big deals. And a number of the big deals are multi-year deals that add to that backlog. Whether it's billed going into deferred revenue or not yet billed and off-balance sheet, these large deals have absolutely expanded the backlog. The only way to break it down by product, I would say, in the opening remarks, 80% of the largest deals had emerging technology as part of those deals. So it's hard to say whether it's just emerging technologies driving it, but I can tell you it's a whole portfolio. We have a much broader portfolio and customers are coming to us, expanding the size of the deals and the duration. That's what's adding to the backlog. The second part of your question about the change, what's going on with the new version of Windows, and our philosophy, I guess, is anytime there's change, it creates opportunity. And the biggest potential market for us to go after now is Linux replacing Windows or maybe new greenfield set up alongside Windows. So we see this as an opportunity for us.\n\n---\n\nI really had 2 questions. One, I wanted to get maybe a little commentary on the go-to-market in distribution side as you start to sell some of the more, I'll say, non-core operating system products and just what, if any, changes do you think you need to augment next fiscal year. And then, Charlie, I know you gave the operating margin guidance for the quarter, but I'm sorry if I missed the full year. But just maybe talk a little bit about how you're thinking about your investment levels and spending around expanding sales and marketing into other geos or even going deeper into coverage models within the existing sales organization.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Jason. I got it. So on the go-to-market, what we have found with the application development and emerging technologies -- and with each new technology, it's been starting out mostly direct, making sure our direct guys have a good understanding of the technology and know-how to sell it, and then from that point, beginning to add channel partners in the various technologies. In some cases, it may be larger SIs. In some cases, it may be existing OEMs who we're helping with another technology. For example, I mean, Dell might be a good example, where they have partnered with us on OpenStack, for example, and they're also a large OEM on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. But I would say that as products mature, then we're more likely to go to a channel model, and that's exactly the way we're pursuing it. In terms of the question on your operating margin, what I said is for the full year, we're targeting operating margin to be about the same as this year, so I think I said around 23.3%. Basically, our view is there's no lack of demand. We need to continue to invest, and so it's a reach question. And yes, we are investing heavily in engineering, support and sales to go after not only the emerging technologies but even Linux. I mean, you saw the expansion -- the acceleration of the infrastructure side of our business this quarter. And so we -- this is not a time to be timid. We believe that a flat operating margin, somewhere in that neighborhood, is the appropriate approach for this year, and we will reinvest the rest of the money back into the business.\n\n---\n\nI was wondering -- I'm going to try to sneak in a 2-part question, too. You mentioned a couple of quarters back about impacts to sort of billings versus revenues from an increasing part of your business coming from public cloud environments like AWS. We haven't heard about that impact, I think, in the last 2 conference calls. Could you give us an update on where we are in that cycle and -- or in this sort of -- whether that continues to ramp up? And then -- and relatedly, when I look at the cash flow guidance, it looks like cash flow is undergrowing operating income a little bit in your guidance range. Typically, those go together. And so what would cause that differentiation in terms of cash flow guidance being less than where your operating income is growing?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Keith. Okay. Let me see if I can handle this. On public cloud, what we -- I'll just go back to review the bidding. It was the fourth quarter of last year in which we did about $9 million in revenue. And at that point in time, the annualized revenue was $36 million. I said I would call out again we -- when we hit a $100 million annualized run rate. I feel reasonably confident that that's going to happen in the next -- within the next 4 quarters. It's been growing very rapidly. It still is the fastest-growing part of the business. We believe we are winning share in the public market as more production workloads go to the public cloud. And so that business is looking good. From a cash flow guidance perspective, what I would say is, one thing to keep in mind. Foreign currencies actually have an impact on the operating cash flow as well. You think about -- we're gaining market share and wallet share in euros and in yen and in all the other currencies in which we do business. When you translate even the cash flow back on a dollar-denominated statement, it has some change in the amount of -- on the dollar side of it. And we're also anticipating that the cash taxes will continue to go up. I think in the model, if you're -- all of you guys were modeling, probably if you anticipate an additional $20 million or so of cash taxes in this model, that would be part of that cash flow guidance I've provided.\n\n---\n\nJust fundamental questions on the business. On -- you mentioned doing cloud, and I think most of it is probably over AWS. As far as I know, you're not on Azure at this point. Are there plans to be, since that's obviously an important platform?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Mike. So first of all, your assumption, the majority of our cloud revenue is, in fact, not from AWS any longer. It was initially, but when they were the only guy, that we have now more than 80 certified cloud providers and less than the majority comes from AWS. And then relative to your question about Azure, we always try to follow our customers' requirements. And if our customers -- if it's in their interest to be on Azure, hopefully we'll find a way to do that. So that's all I have to say about that at this point in time.\n\n---\n\nI just want to begin with your acquisition that you did, mainly eNovance and Inktank, last fiscal year. How much of this -- now eNovance being part of your consulting services. How much is that helping getting some of these large deals in this open hybrid cloud market? And then -- and also, you haven't talked about the Storage. So now it's being part of both Ceph and Gluster integrated. How -- what sort of use cases you're seeing? How is the Storage business doing at this point?\n\n---\n\nYes, this is a Jim. Well, first off, we're seeing a lot of cross benefit with Storage and OpenStack. In fact, half of our OpenStack wins are -- of size, say, 6-figure OpenStack wins in the quarter had Ceph as a component. So really strong affinity between OpenStack and Ceph and our ability to be a credible provider of both, I think, helps us do well in both. So we're seeing a lot of benefit there. Certainly, eNovance and the capabilities we brought has helped us significantly with some of those OpenStack wins, both where we've actually used resources around deployment but also credibility in just being able to build and run those clouds. So just kind of pure sales effort as well as professional services has been very helpful.\n\n---\n\nCharlie, you called out the reacceleration in the infrastructure business. And I'm just curious if you have a sense of kind of the buildup of where that overage is coming back that you didn't see earlier in the year.\n\n---\n\nI think there's a number of things in play here. The public cloud business that we're doing thus far is largely RHEL related, and the reports we're getting out of several of the cloud providers is the majority of that business is actually new business. They're not customers not having done business with us before. So that's certainly a piece of it. I think that the Products and Technology group has done a great job building our emerging technologies on top of RHEL. And so there's a pull sort of back and forth between both -- I think the strong position with our RHEL businesses is helping us build the emerging technology business, and the fact that there's a lot of very attractive emerging technologies is pulling more people to RHEL. So it's kind of working both ways. And that, plus someone earlier had asked about the security question, RHEL is just a more secure system. I think there's a whole lot of reasons why RHEL continues to do well. What we said all along, and if you go back over the 2 or 3 years' data we provided on the 2 different product groupings, that RHEL business is kind of growing in the midteens and this was a 17% quarter. We're very happy about that.\n\n---\n\nThis is actually Matt Swanson on for Matt. It's really nice to see the growth continue in emerging products, 38% in the quarter and 43% in the year. I would assume JBoss is the biggest component in the group. But can you help us think beyond JBoss, how some of the other products rank in terms of contribution to that category?\n\n---\n\nSo first of all, I think your assumption that Middleware -- and I wouldn't say JBoss, I would say Middleware is the largest component of that is probably an appropriate assumption because we've had it the longest. But in terms of any further breakdown, that's not something that we plan to do. We did offer some color, and I'll offer a few other tidbits of color which maybe helped. Clearly, these emerging technologies are gaining traction. I think Jim said -- or perhaps it was Paul, this was the quarter in which we've seen the first time we have a 10 -- a customer on OpenShift over $10 million. That's an important landmark. That's one customer. I would give you a little bit of further clarity on the top 30 deals. 10 of the top 30 deals had OpenStack. 7 of the top 30 deals had OpenShift. 5 of the top 30 deals had Storage. This kind of traction is really important, and it's really beginning to show some leverage. But any further breakdown of the numbers, I don't think -- it's not appropriate to do that.\n\n---\n\nI'd like to ask a question to Paul Cormier. And I really just want to drill down in OpenShift. If we look at kind of the competitive environment, kind of the leading on-premise kind of competitors emerging, yourselves, OpenShift and Cloud Foundry, what do you think are some of the maybe 2, 3, 4 key differences between OpenShift and Cloud Foundry?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think one of the biggest differences is that Cloud Foundry from the various vendors are very different implementations. So getting applications that are compatible across those different vendors in Cloud Foundry will be challenging for one thing. Second thing is that with OpenShift, we use the power of RHEL in SE Linux to really power that. That's something that's got a huge installed base out there with our customers. But also, just as important to that, the services that we have built on JBoss are now very much in demand on the PaaS platform of OpenShift. So things like messaging, for example, that's just -- that's a key component of building applications. And as a platform to build applications, we'll now move all those services which we call xPaaS over to the PaaS -- over to the OpenShift PaaS platform. So I think that's one of the big set of differences is the platform built on standards, leveraging the open source technologies of RHEL and JBoss, and the years of development that's gone into that on our PaaS platform is a key differentiator in my mind.\n\n---\n\nOne other [ph] just quick, but some of the other big deals we did, JEE, it is important that we have full JEE support for a lot of larger customers. For at least a portion of their application portfolio, that matters a lot. The other is OpenShift and OpenStack, the relative affinity there, buying from a leading provider of both is important in a number of the larger wins we've had.\n\n---\n\nOperator, we unfortunately have time for one more question, please.\n\n---\n\nCharlie, back to the emerging technology bucket, you mentioned that it's now at a run rate of $0.25 billion. I know you probably won't want to be too specific, but where is the segment today on its profitability path? Is it becoming less of a margin drag as it scales? Or will that not happen for a little while longer?\n\n---\n\nGood question, but let me clarify. It's not a segment. It's a product grouping, and we don't do full P&Ls. We basically have one sales force that sells everything. Paul runs an engineering for us that is fairly integrated. And so it's not a segment. I would say this, that -- it should be obvious. We've been in the Linux business for a long time, a very established position. It's now a very large part of our business, and we sell it very efficiently. I think we do a great job in support. And with the newer products, they're much younger. With a hypergrowth type of activity, 45% growth, you could expect the P&L to look more like something with a hypergrowth company, and therefore, the profitability is clearly lower. And over time, we would expect that profitability to continue to improve. So I think it's a legitimate question, but we don't have that sort of breakdown.\n\n---\n\nGreat. This concludes our fourth quarter call. We look forward to seeing many of you over the course of the next quarter. Thank you very much.",

The life cycle that we give with all our products, starting with RHEL, is what customers depend on and how to get those security updates in a timely fashion. I mean, it's exactly what we're doing with containers as well because it's the same scenario as we've had with all our products. That life cycle, the update, the security updates, that's a crucial part of the subscription that customers get on all our products, and that's what's a big critical need for them.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nOne of the things that's driving Free to Pay fairly significantly is -- again, people start with free, but when you start thinking about security, needing updates, the major -- Shellshock, Heartbleed, our customers were covered within hours with patches we distribute. That was not true for people on free.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kash Rangan (Analysts)】\nThere are 3 different metrics. You've got revenue and you've got the change in deferred revenue and you've got the change in backlog. The change in backlog obviously seems to be the widest, especially when I look at the emerging technologies, non-infrastructure piece. Could you maybe give us some rank ordering of where you're seeing the biggest growth in your off-balance sheet backlog? It's going from $270 million to $380 million. Looking at the income statement, it looks like anything non-infrastructure related was up roughly $60 million, $70 million or so, but the backlog itself grew a lot more than that. So my question is the delta changed. Where is the growth in the off-balance sheet backlog disproportionately coming relative to the growth you're seeing in the income statement and even in the reported deferred revenue? And if you can, finally, touch upon the Windows 2003 Server refresh and any opportunities for Red Hat, that will be great. And I apologize for the length of the question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nOkay. Thanks, Kash. I would be disappointed if it wasn't a multipart question. Backlog, this comment on backlog was very strong selling activity and expansion with existing customers and the many new customers and big deals. And a number of the big deals are multi-year deals that add to that backlog. Whether it's billed going into deferred revenue or not yet billed and off-balance sheet, these large deals have absolutely expanded the backlog. The only way to break it down by product, I would say, in the opening remarks, 80% of the largest deals had emerging technology as part of those deals. So it's hard to say whether it's just emerging technologies driving it, but I can tell you it's a whole portfolio. We have a much broader portfolio and customers are coming to us, expanding the size of the deals and the duration. That's what's adding to the backlog. The second part of your question about the change, what's going on with the new version of Windows, and our philosophy, I guess, is anytime there's change, it creates opportunity. And the biggest potential market for us to go after now is Linux replacing Windows or maybe new greenfield set up alongside Windows. So we see this as an opportunity for us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jason Maynard (Analysts)】\nI really had 2 questions. One, I wanted to get maybe a little commentary on the go-to-market in distribution side as you start to sell some of the more, I'll say, non-core operating system products and just what, if any, changes do you think you need to augment next fiscal year. And then, Charlie, I know you gave the operating margin guidance for the quarter, but I'm sorry if I missed the full year. But just maybe talk a little bit about how you're thinking about your investment levels and spending around expanding sales and marketing into other geos or even going deeper into coverage models within the existing sales organization.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nThanks, Jason. I got it. So on the go-to-market, what we have found with the application development and emerging technologies -- and with each new technology, it's been starting out mostly direct, making sure our direct guys have a good understanding of the technology and know-how to sell it, and then from that point, beginning to add channel partners in the various technologies. In some cases, it may be larger SIs. In some cases, it may be existing OEMs who we're helping with another technology. For example, I mean, Dell might be a good example, where they have partnered with us on OpenStack, for example, and they're also a large OEM on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. But I would say that as products mature, then we're more likely to go to a channel model, and that's exactly the way we're pursuing it. In terms of the question on your operating margin, what I said is for the full year, we're targeting operating margin to be about the same as this year, so I think I said around 23.3%. Basically, our view is there's no lack of demand. We need to continue to invest, and so it's a reach question. And yes, we are investing heavily in engineering, support and sales to go after not only the emerging technologies but even Linux. I mean, you saw the expansion -- the acceleration of the infrastructure side of our business this quarter. And so we -- this is not a time to be timid. We believe that a flat operating margin, somewhere in that neighborhood, is the appropriate approach for this year, and we will reinvest the rest of the money back into the business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Weiss (Analysts)】\nI was wondering -- I'm going to try to sneak in a 2-part question, too. You mentioned a couple of quarters back about impacts to sort of billings versus revenues from an increasing part of your business coming from public cloud environments like AWS. We haven't heard about that impact, I think, in the last 2 conference calls. Could you give us an update on where we are in that cycle and -- or in this sort of -- whether that continues to ramp up? And then -- and relatedly, when I look at the cash flow guidance, it looks like cash flow is undergrowing operating income a little bit in your guidance range. Typically, those go together. And so what would cause that differentiation in terms of cash flow guidance being less than where your operating income is growing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nThanks, Keith. Okay. Let me see if I can handle this. On public cloud, what we -- I'll just go back to review the bidding. It was the fourth quarter of last year in which we did about $9 million in revenue. And at that point in time, the annualized revenue was $36 million. I said I would call out again we -- when we hit a $100 million annualized run rate. I feel reasonably confident that that's going to happen in the next -- within the next 4 quarters. It's been growing very rapidly. It still is the fastest-growing part of the business. We believe we are winning share in the public market as more production workloads go to the public cloud. And so that business is looking good. From a cash flow guidance perspective, what I would say is, one thing to keep in mind. Foreign currencies actually have an impact on the operating cash flow as well. You think about -- we're gaining market share and wallet share in euros and in yen and in all the other currencies in which we do business. When you translate even the cash flow back on a dollar-denominated statement, it has some change in the amount of -- on the dollar side of it. And we're also anticipating that the cash taxes will continue to go up. I think in the model, if you're -- all of you guys were modeling, probably if you anticipate an additional $20 million or so of cash taxes in this model, that would be part of that cash flow guidance I've provided.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Turits (Analysts)】\nJust fundamental questions on the business. On -- you mentioned doing cloud, and I think most of it is probably over AWS. As far as I know, you're not on Azure at this point. Are there plans to be, since that's obviously an important platform?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Cormier (Executives)】\nThanks, Mike. So first of all, your assumption, the majority of our cloud revenue is, in fact, not from AWS any longer. It was initially, but when they were the only guy, that we have now more than 80 certified cloud providers and less than the majority comes from AWS. And then relative to your question about Azure, we always try to follow our customers' requirements. And if our customers -- if it's in their interest to be on Azure, hopefully we'll find a way to do that. So that's all I have to say about that at this point in time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sitikantha Panigrahi (Analysts)】\nI just want to begin with your acquisition that you did, mainly eNovance and Inktank, last fiscal year. How much of this -- now eNovance being part of your consulting services. How much is that helping getting some of these large deals in this open hybrid cloud market? And then -- and also, you haven't talked about the Storage. So now it's being part of both Ceph and Gluster integrated. How -- what sort of use cases you're seeing? How is the Storage business doing at this point?\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nYes, this is a Jim. Well, first off, we're seeing a lot of cross benefit with Storage and OpenStack. In fact, half of our OpenStack wins are -- of size, say, 6-figure OpenStack wins in the quarter had Ceph as a component. So really strong affinity between OpenStack and Ceph and our ability to be a credible provider of both, I think, helps us do well in both. So we're seeing a lot of benefit there. Certainly, eNovance and the capabilities we brought has helped us significantly with some of those OpenStack wins, both where we've actually used resources around deployment but also credibility in just being able to build and run those clouds. So just kind of pure sales effort as well as professional services has been very helpful.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brent Thill (Analysts)】\nCharlie, you called out the reacceleration in the infrastructure business. And I'm just curious if you have a sense of kind of the buildup of where that overage is coming back that you didn't see earlier in the year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nI think there's a number of things in play here. The public cloud business that we're doing thus far is largely RHEL related, and the reports we're getting out of several of the cloud providers is the majority of that business is actually new business. They're not customers not having done business with us before. So that's certainly a piece of it. I think that the Products and Technology group has done a great job building our emerging technologies on top of RHEL. And so there's a pull sort of back and forth between both -- I think the strong position with our RHEL businesses is helping us build the emerging technology business, and the fact that there's a lot of very attractive emerging technologies is pulling more people to RHEL. So it's kind of working both ways. And that, plus someone earlier had asked about the security question, RHEL is just a more secure system. I think there's a whole lot of reasons why RHEL continues to do well. What we said all along, and if you go back over the 2 or 3 years' data we provided on the 2 different product groupings, that RHEL business is kind of growing in the midteens and this was a 17% quarter. We're very happy about that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Swanson (Analysts)】\nThis is actually Matt Swanson on for Matt. It's really nice to see the growth continue in emerging products, 38% in the quarter and 43% in the year. I would assume JBoss is the biggest component in the group. But can you help us think beyond JBoss, how some of the other products rank in terms of contribution to that category?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nSo first of all, I think your assumption that Middleware -- and I wouldn't say JBoss, I would say Middleware is the largest component of that is probably an appropriate assumption because we've had it the longest. But in terms of any further breakdown, that's not something that we plan to do. We did offer some color, and I'll offer a few other tidbits of color which maybe helped. Clearly, these emerging technologies are gaining traction. I think Jim said -- or perhaps it was Paul, this was the quarter in which we've seen the first time we have a 10 -- a customer on OpenShift over $10 million. That's an important landmark. That's one customer. I would give you a little bit of further clarity on the top 30 deals. 10 of the top 30 deals had OpenStack. 7 of the top 30 deals had OpenShift. 5 of the top 30 deals had Storage. This kind of traction is really important, and it's really beginning to show some leverage. But any further breakdown of the numbers, I don't think -- it's not appropriate to do that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Steven Ashley (Analysts)】\nI'd like to ask a question to Paul Cormier. And I really just want to drill down in OpenShift. If we look at kind of the competitive environment, kind of the leading on-premise kind of competitors emerging, yourselves, OpenShift and Cloud Foundry, what do you think are some of the maybe 2, 3, 4 key differences between OpenShift and Cloud Foundry?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Cormier (Executives)】\nWell, I think one of the biggest differences is that Cloud Foundry from the various vendors are very different implementations. So getting applications that are compatible across those different vendors in Cloud Foundry will be challenging for one thing. Second thing is that with OpenShift, we use the power of RHEL in SE Linux to really power that. That's something that's got a huge installed base out there with our customers. But also, just as important to that, the services that we have built on JBoss are now very much in demand on the PaaS platform of OpenShift. So things like messaging, for example, that's just -- that's a key component of building applications. And as a platform to build applications, we'll now move all those services which we call xPaaS over to the PaaS -- over to the OpenShift PaaS platform. So I think that's one of the big set of differences is the platform built on standards, leveraging the open source technologies of RHEL and JBoss, and the years of development that's gone into that on our PaaS platform is a key differentiator in my mind.\n\n---\n\n【回答: James Whitehurst (Executives)】\nOne other [ph] just quick, but some of the other big deals we did, JEE, it is important that we have full JEE support for a lot of larger customers. For at least a portion of their application portfolio, that matters a lot. The other is OpenShift and OpenStack, the relative affinity there, buying from a leading provider of both is important in a number of the larger wins we've had.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nOperator, we unfortunately have time for one more question, please.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karl Keirstead (Analysts)】\nCharlie, back to the emerging technology bucket, you mentioned that it's now at a run rate of $0.25 billion. I know you probably won't want to be too specific, but where is the segment today on its profitability path? Is it becoming less of a margin drag as it scales? Or will that not happen for a little while longer?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Charles Peters (Executives)】\nGood question, but let me clarify. It's not a segment. It's a product grouping, and we don't do full P&Ls. We basically have one sales force that sells everything. Paul runs an engineering for us that is fairly integrated. And so it's not a segment. I would say this, that -- it should be obvious. We've been in the Linux business for a long time, a very established position. It's now a very large part of our business, and we sell it very efficiently. I think we do a great job in support. And with the newer products, they're much younger. With a hypergrowth type of activity, 45% growth, you could expect the P&L to look more like something with a hypergrowth company, and therefore, the profitability is clearly lower. And over time, we would expect that profitability to continue to improve. So I think it's a legitimate question, but we don't have that sort of breakdown.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Tom McCallum (Executives)】\nGreat. This concludes our fourth quarter call. We look forward to seeing many of you over the course of the next quarter. Thank you very much.",

We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.\r\nBoth our fourth quarter press release, which includes a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures discussed today, and our prepared remarks on this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com.\r\nAfter our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions]\r\nI will now turn the call over to Rodney McMullen, Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Rodney?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Cindy. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.\r\nWith me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and full year 2014 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\r\n2014 was an outstanding year for Kroger. First, let me say how proud I am to work with such a great and outstanding team of associates. Each of them deserve a round of applause for improving our connection with all customers and growing our core business right in line with our growth strategy.\r\nSecond, I am pleased to report that we kept our commitments to you, our shareholders. As you know, the growth plan we first outlined in October of 2012 includes 4 key performance indicators: positive identical supermarket sales growth, slightly expanding nonfuel FIFO operating margin, growing return on invested capital and annual market share growth. In 2014, we met or exceeded each of these metrics. At the end of the year, we achieved an industry-leading 45th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth without fuel. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin, without fuel, on a rolling 4-quarter basis. We improved return on invested capital even as we increased capital investment. And we captured incremental market share for the 10th consecutive year.\r\nStrong performance means strong shareholder returns. We exceeded our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11% in fiscal 2014, and we increased our dividend for the eighth consecutive year since we reinstated our dividend. Because we've been delivering at this level -- higher level of performance consistently and for so long, it can start to look easy or be taken for granted. It is important to know that our associates are committed to our continued success today and for the future.\r\nWe made progress on the other key elements of our growth strategy as well. We're innovating to grow. We expanded our digital capabilities to deepen our relationship with customers in new and exciting ways. More customers than ever before are engaging on our digital properties. The learnings from both our Vitacost and Harris Teeter mergers are allowing us to build an experience that gives the customer, our customers, the ability to interact with us when, where and how they want. Our corporate brand team keeps pushing the boundaries on what customers can expect from store brands. Our leading natural and organic brand, Simple Truth, hit $1 billion in annual sales for the first time and in less than 2 years after the introduction. We are investing to grow in both new and existing markets. We continue to pursue our fill-in strategy and are making great progress. Our mergers with Harris Teeter and Vitacost.com have opened new markets that present meaningful growth opportunities for Kroger.\r\nWe continue to create jobs. Today, we proudly employ nearly 25,000 more associates than we did last year at this time. Every day, we are creating opportunities for both new and current associates.\r\nOur strong across-the-board results during fiscal 2014 allowed us to make a strategic and significant contribution to The Kroger Co. Foundation this year. We use our foundation dollars to support causes that our customers consistently tell us they care about, that enhances our reputation as a locally connected retailer. We are very proud that Forbes magazine previously recognized our work by naming us the most generous company in America. This contribution will allow Kroger to continue to support our key priorities, including hunger relief, breast cancer awareness, the military and their families and local community organizations. We are proud to make this investment to continue our efforts to support our customers and the communities that support our growth.\r\nKroger customers are increasingly positive about the economy since late last year through the new year. They are feeling more comfortable with their discretionary spending, in part due to the low retail price of fuel. Even so, how our customers are doing today depends on the stability of their families' finances. Customers' perception of the economic recovery are still very much divided, and yet we continue to deepen loyalty with all of our customers. That is because whatever the external factors are at play at a given time, be it inflation in certain commodities, fluctuating fuel prices or unemployment, we adjust to win with the customer. So while inflation affected fuel costs through 2014, our personalized offers, weekly promotions and price investments helped customers stretch their dollars. We are currently investing $3.5 billion annually in lower prices. Even though natural and organic foods have been notoriously out of reach for many customers, we used our merchandising expertise, manufacturing base and buying power to make them affordable and accessible to all customers through Simple Truth, which continues to see double-digit sales growth. And while customers will always have evolving expectations for convenience, we have improved our prepared food offering to meet their changing needs as well.\r\nLike a great meal, there is no single characteristic that makes Kroger great. Rather, it is the sum of its parts. It is the combination of food and drink, people and atmosphere, surprise and delight that makes a great meal great. And it is that combination of factors that our associates bring together, the sum of our parts, that explains why Kroger is so successful.\r\nBefore I turn it over to Mike Ellis, I wanted to let you know that both the Harris Teeter and Vitacost mergers are going very well, thanks to the incredible people at both companies. Mike will have more to say about these and our operational performance. Mike?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Rodney. Good morning, everyone.\r\nThis was a great quarter capping off a really great year. Our associates make everything happen, and they knocked it out of the park this year on several fronts. We achieved an outstanding fourth quarter ID sales growth, without fuel, of 6%. As Rodney pointed out in our press release this morning, while improved fuel margins contributed significantly to our reported results in the second half of the year, our operating performance without fuel shows that our associates are continuing to deepen our relationship with customers in very meaningful ways. The better our connection with customers, the better our shareholder returns.\r\nOur identical sales performance was supported by robust performance in every department in every supermarket division. Natural foods, meat, deli and pharmacy departments all posted double-digit identical sales growth. For the 10th year in a row, we lowered costs and reinvested those savings to improve our store experience. It's no surprise that Kroger captured more share of the massive food market also for the 10th year in a row. Our consistent market share gains drive top and bottom line growth and generate lasting shareholder value. We report on market share annually and look at it as the customers would look at it, where they spend their money. Last year, we began using Nielsen point-of-sale plus, a Kroger term for Nielsen data that includes all point-of-sale data from several competitors and includes all departments inside our stores, except for pharmacy.\r\nThe data is generated by retailers who report their sales to Nielsen. This includes all major food, drug, mass and dollar competitors, as well as most club competitors. It does not include C-stores. Nielsen POS plus captures roughly 85% of the items we sell, including EPC-coded items, PLU and random-weight items, making it a really good and consistent source.\r\nAccording to Nielsen POS plus data, Kroger's overall market share of the products we sell in the markets where we operate grew approximately 60 basis points during fiscal 2014. This data also indicates that our share increased in 18 of the 20 markets outlined by the Nielsen report and was down slightly in just 2 markets. Walmart is one of our top competitors in 15 of the 20 markets outlined in the Nielsen report. Kroger's share increased in all of those markets.\r\nIn addition to market share growth, we regularly measure our loyal household growth because it lets us know how well we are connecting with our best customers. During the fourth quarter, we continued to grow the number of loyal households and at a much faster rate than total household growth, which was also up for the quarter. Customers are buying fewer units per basket but visiting our stores more frequently. This is consistent with the trend for the past several quarters.\r\nInflation continued in pharmacy and among commodities such as meat during the fourth quarter. We estimate product inflation was 3.5%, excluding fuel, for the fourth quarter. In 2015, we expect the strong tonnage growth that we saw in the fourth quarter to continue.\r\nWe've talked a lot this year about our Corporate Brands growth and success. That trend continued in the fourth quarter, with Corporate Brands representing 28.2% of total units sold, the highest level in at least 7 years; and 25.8% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. The star, of course, has been Simple Truth, and in 2014, Simple Truth reached an amazing milestone by hitting a $1.2 billion annual sales mark. Simple Truth has been our most successful brand launch ever, reaching billion-dollar-brand status in less than 2 short years. During the year, more than 20 million households bought 1 or more of our 2,688 Simple Truth or Simple Truth Organic items. The brand continues to earn double-digit unit and sales growth, which we don't see ending anytime soon.\r\nShifting gears. We just completed our first year since merging with Harris Teeter, and our integration efforts have been fantastic. We are creating synergies both ways and we are learning new ways to connect with our customers. The Harris Teeter team is great, and both they and our general office teams have done an outstanding job in working together. Also, we are 6 months into the Vitacost merger, and our integration is going well. We continue to discover new ways to use Vitacost as a strategic advantage. We already have a strong national foods business, and Vitacost is helping us get better in that category. A cornerstone of our ability to deliver successful mergers is partnering with businesses that share our cultures and values. This makes it easy to share ideas between each other. Harris Teeter and Vitacost both illustrate that point.\r\nFinally, I'll provide a brief update on labor relations. We are currently negotiating in Louisville and with the Teamsters, covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. During 2015, we will also negotiate agreements with the UFCW for store associates in Columbus; Denver; Las Vegas; Memphis; and Portland, Oregon. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good-quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continued to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective: growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and more career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. We have very positive momentum with our customers, associates and communities as we move into 2015.\r\nNow Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's growth metrics and financial results as well as our guidance for 2015. Mike?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Mike. And good morning, everyone.\r\nBefore I share our fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 results, there are a few things to keep in mind about fiscal 2014. There are 2 items that we are adjusting our full year results for: charges incurred in the first quarter related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits and certain tax benefits that we enjoyed in the third quarter. A lot of other things happened throughout the year as well, including low retail fuel prices and unusually high fuel margins, a LIFO charge that was significantly higher in 2014 than 2013, a $55 million contribution to our UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan in the fourth quarter. And as Rodney mentioned, we contributed $85 million to the company's charitable foundation throughout the year, $60 million of which was in the fourth quarter.\r\nNow I'll share our fourth quarter results. Please note that Kroger's operating results include Harris Teeter in the fourth quarter in fiscal 2014 but not the fourth quarter in fiscal 2013, which affects many year-over-year comparisons.\r\nTotal sales in the fourth quarter were $25.2 billion, an increase of 8.5%. Excluding fuel, total sales increased 14.2%. Net earnings for the fourth quarter totaled $518 million or $1.04 per diluted share. We recorded a $9 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $10 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. FIFO gross margin was comparable to the same period last year, excluding retail fuel operations.\r\nTotal operating expenses, excluding retail fuel operations, the contributions to the pension and foundation and the adjustment items, decreased 15 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the same period last year.\r\nBefore I move on to discuss Kroger's full year 2014 results, I'll share some data on our fuel operations, which includes our supermarket fuel and C-store business. In the fourth quarter, our cents-per-gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.234 compared to $0.113 in the same quarter last year. For the full year, the cents-per-gallon fuel margin was roughly $0.19 compared to $0.141 last year. Going forward, we expect fuel margins to return to historical averages.\r\nTurning now to Kroger's full year results for 2014.\r\nKroger reported total sales of $108.5 billion in 2014, an increase of 10.3%. Excluding fuel, total sales increased 12.9% over the prior year. Identical supermarket sales without fuel increased 5.2% in 2014 compared with the prior fiscal year. Net earnings for 2014 totaled $1.73 billion or $3.44 per diluted share. Excluding the 2014 adjustment items, net earnings for 2014 totaled $1.77 billion or $3.52 per diluted share.\r\nIt is important to note that if you look at adjusted EPS excluding fuel, it was at the high end of our long-term growth rate, even with the contributions to the pension and foundation included. So while fuel margins get a lot of attention, our nonfuel business had a spectacular year.\r\nKroger's LIFO charge for 2014 was $147 million, significantly higher than 2013 due to higher product costs. FIFO gross margin for 2014, excluding retail fuel operations, declined 3 basis points. As Mike said, strong identical supermarket sales and cost controls allowed Kroger to reduce operating expenses as a rate of sales for our 10th consecutive year. Total operating expenses for 2014, excluding retail fuel operations, the contributions to the pension and foundation and the adjustment items, decreased 13 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the prior year. FIFO operating margin for 2014, excluding those same items, increased 10 basis points compared with the prior fiscal year.\r\nKroger's strong EBITDA performance resulted in a return on invested capital for fiscal 2014 of 13.74% compared with 13.3 -- compared with 13.43% for fiscal 2013.\r\nFor 2015, our planned uses of cash remain unchanged: maintain our current investment grade debt rating, repurchase shares, fund the dividend and increase capital investments. In connection with our merger with Harris Teeter, we committed to getting back to a 2x to 2.2x net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio by mid- to late fiscal 2015. I'm pleased to report that we achieved our objective earlier than anticipated due to strong fiscal 2014 operating results. As of the close of the fourth quarter, net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 2.15x compared to 2.43x during the same period last year, as described in Table 5 of the press release. Based on our current 2015 expectations, we should maintain a ratio below the 2.2x target throughout the year.\r\nCapital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $2.8 billion for the year compared to $2.3 billion in 2013. For 2015, we expect capital investments to be in the $3 billion to $3.3 billion range.\r\nAs you know, part of our long-term growth strategy is to increase capital investments over time. New store openings are meeting our expectations. We have a great pipeline of high-quality projects that we expect to allow this result to continue. We will allocate more of the spend to increase square footage in our fill-in markets. We have now identified 8 markets for fill-in opportunities. This is up from 6. Our excitement for this activity continues to grow.\r\nKroger's strong financial position allowed the company to return more than $1.6 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. During the year, Kroger repurchased 28.4 million common shares for a total investment of $1.3 billion. As of February 27, 2015, Kroger has approximately $432 million remaining under the $500 million share repurchase authority granted in June of 2014.\r\nNow I would like to outline our specific growth objectives for 2015.\r\nWe anticipate identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 3% to 4% for fiscal 2015. This range takes into account several factors: it's early in the year, our outlook for inflation is lower than actual inflation last year, and we expect our strong trend in unit growth to continue in 2015.\r\nFull year net earnings for fiscal 2015 are expected to range from $3.80 to $3.90 per diluted share. This equates to Kroger's long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 11 -- of 8% to 11%, growing off of 2014 adjusted earnings of $3.52 per diluted share. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that is expected to increase over time.\r\nAs we think about the growth in 2015, we expect fuel margins to return to historical averages. We are not planning for similar contributions to the pension or foundation, and we expect LIFO to be lower than it was in 2014. We are anticipating inflation, without fuel, of 1% to 2%, and the actual amount will be driven primarily by inflation in meat and pharmacy. So while fuel margins will be a headwind in 2015, we expect they will be offset by a lower LIFO charge, no planned contributions to the pension plan and our foundation and the continued strength in our core business.\r\nFor the full year, our expectation is that we will be in the middle portion of the range. As we look at quarter comparisons in relation to our 8% to 11% annual growth rate, we believe quarter 1 will be in the range, quarters 2 and 3 will be slightly above the range and quarter 4 will be below the range as we -- and as we expect Kroger's full year operating profit margin in 2015, excluding fuel, to expand slightly compared to 2014 results.\r\nNow I'll turn it back to Rodney.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Mike.\r\nI am so proud of our team. We fulfilled our commitments to our customers, associates, shareholders and bondholders in 2014.\r\nKroger captured more share of the massive food market and continued to invest in growing our business. We created thousands of new jobs and hired more than 6,000 veterans last year. While we are very proud of this outstanding year, we are committed to even more. As I mentioned at our Investor Day, our to-do list remains longer than our done list.\r\nNow we look forward to your questions.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Cindy Holmes (Executives)】\nThank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us.\r\nBefore we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.\r\nBoth our fourth quarter press release, which includes a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures discussed today, and our prepared remarks on this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com.\r\nAfter our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions]\r\nI will now turn the call over to Rodney McMullen, Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Rodney?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThank you, Cindy. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.\r\nWith me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and full year 2014 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\r\n2014 was an outstanding year for Kroger. First, let me say how proud I am to work with such a great and outstanding team of associates. Each of them deserve a round of applause for improving our connection with all customers and growing our core business right in line with our growth strategy.\r\nSecond, I am pleased to report that we kept our commitments to you, our shareholders. As you know, the growth plan we first outlined in October of 2012 includes 4 key performance indicators: positive identical supermarket sales growth, slightly expanding nonfuel FIFO operating margin, growing return on invested capital and annual market share growth. In 2014, we met or exceeded each of these metrics. At the end of the year, we achieved an industry-leading 45th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth without fuel. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin, without fuel, on a rolling 4-quarter basis. We improved return on invested capital even as we increased capital investment. And we captured incremental market share for the 10th consecutive year.\r\nStrong performance means strong shareholder returns. We exceeded our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11% in fiscal 2014, and we increased our dividend for the eighth consecutive year since we reinstated our dividend. Because we've been delivering at this level -- higher level of performance consistently and for so long, it can start to look easy or be taken for granted. It is important to know that our associates are committed to our continued success today and for the future.\r\nWe made progress on the other key elements of our growth strategy as well. We're innovating to grow. We expanded our digital capabilities to deepen our relationship with customers in new and exciting ways. More customers than ever before are engaging on our digital properties. The learnings from both our Vitacost and Harris Teeter mergers are allowing us to build an experience that gives the customer, our customers, the ability to interact with us when, where and how they want. Our corporate brand team keeps pushing the boundaries on what customers can expect from store brands. Our leading natural and organic brand, Simple Truth, hit $1 billion in annual sales for the first time and in less than 2 years after the introduction. We are investing to grow in both new and existing markets. We continue to pursue our fill-in strategy and are making great progress. Our mergers with Harris Teeter and Vitacost.com have opened new markets that present meaningful growth opportunities for Kroger.\r\nWe continue to create jobs. Today, we proudly employ nearly 25,000 more associates than we did last year at this time. Every day, we are creating opportunities for both new and current associates.\r\nOur strong across-the-board results during fiscal 2014 allowed us to make a strategic and significant contribution to The Kroger Co. Foundation this year. We use our foundation dollars to support causes that our customers consistently tell us they care about, that enhances our reputation as a locally connected retailer. We are very proud that Forbes magazine previously recognized our work by naming us the most generous company in America. This contribution will allow Kroger to continue to support our key priorities, including hunger relief, breast cancer awareness, the military and their families and local community organizations. We are proud to make this investment to continue our efforts to support our customers and the communities that support our growth.\r\nKroger customers are increasingly positive about the economy since late last year through the new year. They are feeling more comfortable with their discretionary spending, in part due to the low retail price of fuel. Even so, how our customers are doing today depends on the stability of their families' finances. Customers' perception of the economic recovery are still very much divided, and yet we continue to deepen loyalty with all of our customers. That is because whatever the external factors are at play at a given time, be it inflation in certain commodities, fluctuating fuel prices or unemployment, we adjust to win with the customer. So while inflation affected fuel costs through 2014, our personalized offers, weekly promotions and price investments helped customers stretch their dollars. We are currently investing $3.5 billion annually in lower prices. Even though natural and organic foods have been notoriously out of reach for many customers, we used our merchandising expertise, manufacturing base and buying power to make them affordable and accessible to all customers through Simple Truth, which continues to see double-digit sales growth. And while customers will always have evolving expectations for convenience, we have improved our prepared food offering to meet their changing needs as well.\r\nLike a great meal, there is no single characteristic that makes Kroger great. Rather, it is the sum of its parts. It is the combination of food and drink, people and atmosphere, surprise and delight that makes a great meal great. And it is that combination of factors that our associates bring together, the sum of our parts, that explains why Kroger is so successful.\r\nBefore I turn it over to Mike Ellis, I wanted to let you know that both the Harris Teeter and Vitacost mergers are going very well, thanks to the incredible people at both companies. Mike will have more to say about these and our operational performance. Mike?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nThanks, Rodney. Good morning, everyone.\r\nThis was a great quarter capping off a really great year. Our associates make everything happen, and they knocked it out of the park this year on several fronts. We achieved an outstanding fourth quarter ID sales growth, without fuel, of 6%. As Rodney pointed out in our press release this morning, while improved fuel margins contributed significantly to our reported results in the second half of the year, our operating performance without fuel shows that our associates are continuing to deepen our relationship with customers in very meaningful ways. The better our connection with customers, the better our shareholder returns.\r\nOur identical sales performance was supported by robust performance in every department in every supermarket division. Natural foods, meat, deli and pharmacy departments all posted double-digit identical sales growth. For the 10th year in a row, we lowered costs and reinvested those savings to improve our store experience. It's no surprise that Kroger captured more share of the massive food market also for the 10th year in a row. Our consistent market share gains drive top and bottom line growth and generate lasting shareholder value. We report on market share annually and look at it as the customers would look at it, where they spend their money. Last year, we began using Nielsen point-of-sale plus, a Kroger term for Nielsen data that includes all point-of-sale data from several competitors and includes all departments inside our stores, except for pharmacy.\r\nThe data is generated by retailers who report their sales to Nielsen. This includes all major food, drug, mass and dollar competitors, as well as most club competitors. It does not include C-stores. Nielsen POS plus captures roughly 85% of the items we sell, including EPC-coded items, PLU and random-weight items, making it a really good and consistent source.\r\nAccording to Nielsen POS plus data, Kroger's overall market share of the products we sell in the markets where we operate grew approximately 60 basis points during fiscal 2014. This data also indicates that our share increased in 18 of the 20 markets outlined by the Nielsen report and was down slightly in just 2 markets. Walmart is one of our top competitors in 15 of the 20 markets outlined in the Nielsen report. Kroger's share increased in all of those markets.\r\nIn addition to market share growth, we regularly measure our loyal household growth because it lets us know how well we are connecting with our best customers. During the fourth quarter, we continued to grow the number of loyal households and at a much faster rate than total household growth, which was also up for the quarter. Customers are buying fewer units per basket but visiting our stores more frequently. This is consistent with the trend for the past several quarters.\r\nInflation continued in pharmacy and among commodities such as meat during the fourth quarter. We estimate product inflation was 3.5%, excluding fuel, for the fourth quarter. In 2015, we expect the strong tonnage growth that we saw in the fourth quarter to continue.\r\nWe've talked a lot this year about our Corporate Brands growth and success. That trend continued in the fourth quarter, with Corporate Brands representing 28.2% of total units sold, the highest level in at least 7 years; and 25.8% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. The star, of course, has been Simple Truth, and in 2014, Simple Truth reached an amazing milestone by hitting a $1.2 billion annual sales mark. Simple Truth has been our most successful brand launch ever, reaching billion-dollar-brand status in less than 2 short years. During the year, more than 20 million households bought 1 or more of our 2,688 Simple Truth or Simple Truth Organic items. The brand continues to earn double-digit unit and sales growth, which we don't see ending anytime soon.\r\nShifting gears. We just completed our first year since merging with Harris Teeter, and our integration efforts have been fantastic. We are creating synergies both ways and we are learning new ways to connect with our customers. The Harris Teeter team is great, and both they and our general office teams have done an outstanding job in working together. Also, we are 6 months into the Vitacost merger, and our integration is going well. We continue to discover new ways to use Vitacost as a strategic advantage. We already have a strong national foods business, and Vitacost is helping us get better in that category. A cornerstone of our ability to deliver successful mergers is partnering with businesses that share our cultures and values. This makes it easy to share ideas between each other. Harris Teeter and Vitacost both illustrate that point.\r\nFinally, I'll provide a brief update on labor relations. We are currently negotiating in Louisville and with the Teamsters, covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. During 2015, we will also negotiate agreements with the UFCW for store associates in Columbus; Denver; Las Vegas; Memphis; and Portland, Oregon. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good-quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continued to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective: growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and more career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. We have very positive momentum with our customers, associates and communities as we move into 2015.\r\nNow Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's growth metrics and financial results as well as our guidance for 2015. Mike?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nThanks, Mike. And good morning, everyone.\r\nBefore I share our fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 results, there are a few things to keep in mind about fiscal 2014. There are 2 items that we are adjusting our full year results for: charges incurred in the first quarter related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits and certain tax benefits that we enjoyed in the third quarter. A lot of other things happened throughout the year as well, including low retail fuel prices and unusually high fuel margins, a LIFO charge that was significantly higher in 2014 than 2013, a $55 million contribution to our UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan in the fourth quarter. And as Rodney mentioned, we contributed $85 million to the company's charitable foundation throughout the year, $60 million of which was in the fourth quarter.\r\nNow I'll share our fourth quarter results. Please note that Kroger's operating results include Harris Teeter in the fourth quarter in fiscal 2014 but not the fourth quarter in fiscal 2013, which affects many year-over-year comparisons.\r\nTotal sales in the fourth quarter were $25.2 billion, an increase of 8.5%. Excluding fuel, total sales increased 14.2%. Net earnings for the fourth quarter totaled $518 million or $1.04 per diluted share. We recorded a $9 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $10 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. FIFO gross margin was comparable to the same period last year, excluding retail fuel operations.\r\nTotal operating expenses, excluding retail fuel operations, the contributions to the pension and foundation and the adjustment items, decreased 15 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the same period last year.\r\nBefore I move on to discuss Kroger's full year 2014 results, I'll share some data on our fuel operations, which includes our supermarket fuel and C-store business. In the fourth quarter, our cents-per-gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.234 compared to $0.113 in the same quarter last year. For the full year, the cents-per-gallon fuel margin was roughly $0.19 compared to $0.141 last year. Going forward, we expect fuel margins to return to historical averages.\r\nTurning now to Kroger's full year results for 2014.\r\nKroger reported total sales of $108.5 billion in 2014, an increase of 10.3%. Excluding fuel, total sales increased 12.9% over the prior year. Identical supermarket sales without fuel increased 5.2% in 2014 compared with the prior fiscal year. Net earnings for 2014 totaled $1.73 billion or $3.44 per diluted share. Excluding the 2014 adjustment items, net earnings for 2014 totaled $1.77 billion or $3.52 per diluted share.\r\nIt is important to note that if you look at adjusted EPS excluding fuel, it was at the high end of our long-term growth rate, even with the contributions to the pension and foundation included. So while fuel margins get a lot of attention, our nonfuel business had a spectacular year.\r\nKroger's LIFO charge for 2014 was $147 million, significantly higher than 2013 due to higher product costs. FIFO gross margin for 2014, excluding retail fuel operations, declined 3 basis points. As Mike said, strong identical supermarket sales and cost controls allowed Kroger to reduce operating expenses as a rate of sales for our 10th consecutive year. Total operating expenses for 2014, excluding retail fuel operations, the contributions to the pension and foundation and the adjustment items, decreased 13 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the prior year. FIFO operating margin for 2014, excluding those same items, increased 10 basis points compared with the prior fiscal year.\r\nKroger's strong EBITDA performance resulted in a return on invested capital for fiscal 2014 of 13.74% compared with 13.3 -- compared with 13.43% for fiscal 2013.\r\nFor 2015, our planned uses of cash remain unchanged: maintain our current investment grade debt rating, repurchase shares, fund the dividend and increase capital investments. In connection with our merger with Harris Teeter, we committed to getting back to a 2x to 2.2x net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio by mid- to late fiscal 2015. I'm pleased to report that we achieved our objective earlier than anticipated due to strong fiscal 2014 operating results. As of the close of the fourth quarter, net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 2.15x compared to 2.43x during the same period last year, as described in Table 5 of the press release. Based on our current 2015 expectations, we should maintain a ratio below the 2.2x target throughout the year.\r\nCapital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $2.8 billion for the year compared to $2.3 billion in 2013. For 2015, we expect capital investments to be in the $3 billion to $3.3 billion range.\r\nAs you know, part of our long-term growth strategy is to increase capital investments over time. New store openings are meeting our expectations. We have a great pipeline of high-quality projects that we expect to allow this result to continue. We will allocate more of the spend to increase square footage in our fill-in markets. We have now identified 8 markets for fill-in opportunities. This is up from 6. Our excitement for this activity continues to grow.\r\nKroger's strong financial position allowed the company to return more than $1.6 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. During the year, Kroger repurchased 28.4 million common shares for a total investment of $1.3 billion. As of February 27, 2015, Kroger has approximately $432 million remaining under the $500 million share repurchase authority granted in June of 2014.\r\nNow I would like to outline our specific growth objectives for 2015.\r\nWe anticipate identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 3% to 4% for fiscal 2015. This range takes into account several factors: it's early in the year, our outlook for inflation is lower than actual inflation last year, and we expect our strong trend in unit growth to continue in 2015.\r\nFull year net earnings for fiscal 2015 are expected to range from $3.80 to $3.90 per diluted share. This equates to Kroger's long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 11 -- of 8% to 11%, growing off of 2014 adjusted earnings of $3.52 per diluted share. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that is expected to increase over time.\r\nAs we think about the growth in 2015, we expect fuel margins to return to historical averages. We are not planning for similar contributions to the pension or foundation, and we expect LIFO to be lower than it was in 2014. We are anticipating inflation, without fuel, of 1% to 2%, and the actual amount will be driven primarily by inflation in meat and pharmacy. So while fuel margins will be a headwind in 2015, we expect they will be offset by a lower LIFO charge, no planned contributions to the pension plan and our foundation and the continued strength in our core business.\r\nFor the full year, our expectation is that we will be in the middle portion of the range. As we look at quarter comparisons in relation to our 8% to 11% annual growth rate, we believe quarter 1 will be in the range, quarters 2 and 3 will be slightly above the range and quarter 4 will be below the range as we -- and as we expect Kroger's full year operating profit margin in 2015, excluding fuel, to expand slightly compared to 2014 results.\r\nNow I'll turn it back to Rodney.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThanks, Mike.\r\nI am so proud of our team. We fulfilled our commitments to our customers, associates, shareholders and bondholders in 2014.\r\nKroger captured more share of the massive food market and continued to invest in growing our business. We created thousands of new jobs and hired more than 6,000 veterans last year. While we are very proud of this outstanding year, we are committed to even more. As I mentioned at our Investor Day, our to-do list remains longer than our done list.\r\nNow we look forward to your questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "So guys, a few things. I think you said $3.5 billion of annual investment in price. Was that right? And what do you include in there? Is that merely price reductions, promotions or something else? Is that sustainable? Do you think you can do $3.5 billion a year? And then what happens to the elasticity of the return over time if the returns remain high on that investment?\n\n---\n\nYes, that's $3.5 billion, John, that you heard us talk about. Yes, that's an annual number. And that's the annual number in 2014. Now if you look at -- obviously, we started the journey about 10 years ago of taking cost out of the business and taking that -- as we take cost out of the business, giving the customer better value both in everyday price and promotional. We would -- we see it as our strategy to continue that as we take costs out of the business. We'll continue to give that to the customer in a combination of service and price based on what we see the opportunities to be. We are very satisfied with the elasticity of the demand side as we invest in price. Obviously, we have a tremendous amount of data that we have developed internally to make sure that we're investing that in the right place where we get the best return. So we would see it sustainable, and it is part of our continued strategy. I don't know, Mike. Anything you want to add?\n\n---\n\nNo, I think that's it, Rodney.\n\n---\n\nOkay, so as far as you can tell, there's enough things to invest in that the return will remain -- you think it will remain what it's been, as far as the eye can see, it sounds like.\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely. And every category would have different results, and that's one of the values of our insight is understanding that.\n\n---\n\nAll right. And then just one for Mike Schlotman. I know you guys have liked a front-end-loaded buyback program, right, for the productivity that gives you throughout the year. Is that the idea this year? Is that sort of embedded in the guidance, that a lot of it will be done in the first half?\n\n---\n\nYes, I would say the day-to-day market conditions will wind up dictating when we make those investments, but I would point out the fact that, at the end of -- when we had our conference call in December, we had not used any of the $500 million buyback authorization. And from my comments today, we have used some now.\n\n---\n\nSo I just want to start maybe with the center store trends. We've heard from a number of large CPG players just about challenges in the -- some of the center store categories. So I wanted to get a sense whether you guys are seeing the same thing. Or any more color what's happening there?\n\n---\n\nWell, actually, our center store has performed better in the fourth quarter than it had in other quarters in 2014. And we've done a lot of work in relaying our center store, getting things refreshed, new products in. And it's been a big focus of us to using customer insights and really going through our stores and doing the work that's around assortment that's really effective.\n\n---\n\nThe other thing that's -- a lot of the CPGs would have something different than what we would have is, a lot of the natural food items, do you include that in center store or a separate department? And it's getting increasingly complicated because there are certain categories where natural foods is almost as big as the historical business. So it's a short question but hard to answer. And for us, we're all -- we're completely focused on what it is the customer wants.\n\n---\n\nAnd then switching gears maybe to the Simple Truth brand. You achieved your targets this year for sales of more than $1 billion. Do you have any new targets out there? And is it getting more difficult to get the supply for that business?\n\n---\n\nSupply has been an issue in certain areas, but when you have over 2,600 items, we have a great base of product today, and we're going to continue to expand that. But for the most part, in some of the perishable areas, there's been a supply issue or 2, but we've been able to really take care of the customer. And I don't foresee anything this year in the near future.\n\n---\n\nYes, but certain categories will always have some tightness on supply, especially at the front end, as farmers transition over to growing more of the organic or natural product.\n\n---\n\nOkay, I have made -- and this is a question for Mike. Do you...\n\n---\n\nWhich one?\n\n---\n\nRight, that's right. Mike Schlotman. Question about labor negotiations. The very strong performance of the company, do you think that makes it harder for you to get the unions to go along with what you want? Or are they -- maybe a better -- bigger question is, are they pushing for wage increases?\n\n---\n\nOur -- if you look at our average wage of our hourly associates in the store, it's nearly $14 an hour. And if you look at the total benefit package our associates enjoy, it's even stronger than that. It varies, obviously, by geography and particular contracts, but we've been on the forefront not only with a good solid wage. We've had -- we've been very upfront with the unions and have done a lot of things to protect the future pension benefits of our associates, what -- which others aren't doing out there. It's not just the big one we did 2 or 3 years ago. We did some more smaller ones in the first quarter this year, and it wouldn't surprise me if there'll be others that we wind up doing in the future. If you look overall, we are adding jobs. And we added 25,000 jobs last year. We're up to 400,000 jobs. One of the things that we like to say around Kroger is, a lot of people, particularly part-time workers that are under 18, they come to Kroger looking for a job, and they stay for a career. If you look around the ranks of our store managers, 2/3 of them started out as hourly, part-time hourly associates in our store. And that really just talks to the fabric of Kroger and how well we treat our associates overall. So it's more than just about the wages. There's a lot more behind the scenes of what those associates look for when they come to Kroger.\n\n---\n\nPlus what you make today is something different than you'll make in a -- as you get promoted throughout your career and take on more responsibility.\n\n---\n\nRight.\n\n---\n\nAnd then changing gears, maybe just talk a little bit about the test you have of click and collect in Cincinnati. Maybe it's too early to say anything, but are you feeling good about how that's going?\n\n---\n\nWell, it is too early to really to say anything, Meredith, but the learnings that we have from Harris Teeter is really helping us develop our plans on how we're going to go forward. And Harris Teeter has had a very successful business for -- well, they started over 10 years ago in the click-and-collect world. And we've learned a lot, and it's really helping us accelerate our learning and growth.\n\n---\n\nJust a little color, I guess, following on John Heinbockel's question. In terms of share buybacks, obviously, your guidance for fiscal '15 is very strong given the tailwind that you're going to have in gas margins. So, I mean, maybe a little color on how much of this is buyback related versus core EBIT growth. I don't know if you can just elaborate a little bit on that.\n\n---\n\nYes, I won't get that granular on the model. From an expectation standpoint, you should have the expectation we'll probably spend a little bit less on share buyback during -- in terms of dollars in 2015 versus 2014. We are increasing our expectations for capital spend by a few hundred million dollars more just because of the great pipeline of projects I spoke of in the prepared comments. And that's what we think, we would believe, is the driver for growth in the future. Keep in mind, back in October of '12, we said, for the first couple of years of this new growth model, we would have 25 -- 1/4 to 1/3 of our EPS growth may come from share buybacks, but that would decline over time as we continue to open successful stores in our fill-in markets.\n\n---\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And then just looking at the year in general. So when I look at obviously how strong this year was, can you maybe try to frame how much of that was Harris Teeter related in terms of Harris Teeter outperforming what your original guidance was on accretion? I mean, obviously, let's exclude fuel from the conversation. And then just following on that is, when we start to model comps throughout the year, any color on how we should think of how Harris Teeter, now that it's in the comp base, how that'll impact the comps throughout the year?\n\n---\n\nWell, I won't give specifics on Harris Teeter. I would say that they added a little bit more to earnings per share than our original expectations for the year. They had a phenomenal year. They also helped the core Kroger with some ideas that they have done historically and helped the core Kroger have a very strong year as well. Relative to the comp cadence throughout the year, even though we only had Harris Teeter as a business for this year, we included them in our comp base all year using their 2013 sales. So the sales numbers we reported during 2014 actually included Harris Teeter as though we had owned them in 2013. So there won't be a big inflection point in ID sales from including Harris Teeter going forward.\n\n---\n\nEven though the comps might have been pressured from investing in price?\n\n---\n\nThey -- again, their ID sales were included in our 2014 results, so going forward, they'll continue to be in there.\n\n---\n\nKaren, what I would -- I'm just going to add to Mike's thing. If you look at -- Harris Teeter delivered more than we were expecting, and that was driven because of their strong operations and synergies, but -- fuel obviously drove it, but if you look at core Kroger even without those 2 items, we still exceeded as well. So it's really all 3 pieces that drove the strong results.\n\n---\n\nThe first question, just for Mike Schlotman. On the cadence of the EPS growth next year, Mike, you mentioned Q1 being in line with the range for the year. I guess I would have thought that maybe it would have been better because the fuel comparison's obviously easier there. You still get the benefit from the repo in the first quarter and the share count. And then I would imagine that your comps are probably stronger earlier in the year than later. Could you just maybe help us understand why Q1 would be -- would just be in line?\n\n---\n\nAt this point, that's -- we had a very, very strong first quarter last year, so we are comping off of that. I agree that there will still be some residual benefit in the first quarter from the share buyback, but that was very front-end loaded last year. And we'll -- and as I said earlier, we'll buy less shares back this year than last year. So the combination of those, the way we bought it back last year did hit -- help the first quarter a bit. It's -- a lot of it winds up depending on a huge number of factors. And we just recently finalized our business plan by quarter based off of how the year wound up and what our expectations are for the various quarters. And the best answer I can give you is we're trying to be transparent about how our operators and so forth feel about the cadence throughout the year, and that's what our expectations are. There's a lot of factors that go into it. LIFO certainly will play a factor of how and when we get expense charges in the quarter. As you know, we increased our LIFO charge throughout the year and then it came down in the fourth quarter. So if our estimate for LIFO is accurate this year, second and third quarter will be helped a little bit by a lower LIFO charge as compared to the prior year. So there's lots of things that wind up going into building that model.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just a follow-up, and this is just on your IDs generally. Your IDs typically have outpaced the industry for a very long time, but it does seem like, more recently, that this gap has widened. And I guess what I'm trying to ask you is, is there anything that you can identify, do you think, that's driven that acceleration? For instance, you saw a -- the windfall in fuel in the back half. Have you been able to use some of those proceeds to help you around the pricing front, as -- and other things that have maybe helped this acceleration in the outperformance to the industry?\n\n---\n\nEd, it's a question that actually we have spent a little bit of time trying to think through internally. And probably the biggest thing is our associates, our store teams and their -- and all the people that's work our stores. They continue to do a better job of serving -- helping serve our customers on a daily basis, everything from making sure products are fresher to making sure that we treat our customers right. And we really do believe we had a great foundation in place, and our associates really are taking it up to the next level in terms of how they're taking care of our customers. And we think that that's what's -- the thing that's really been successful, and we really appreciate what our associates are doing.\n\n---\n\nWanted to ask about natural organic, which as you mentioned, of course, continues to see some nice growth, Simple Truth being the main contributor to that. But outside of Simple Truth, can you give any other color in terms of maybe some other category or brand growth within it? And in particular, maybe any early just color around Vitacost, any cross-selling or expansion there?\n\n---\n\nGreat question. Within natural foods, there are so many categories that customers are connecting with today that get stronger and stronger, from dairy products, gluten-free. We can go on and on. And our ability to cross-merchandise some of those products throughout the store, I think, has made some of those products more available in a broader way to a larger customer base. We keep talking about the blurring of departments, and natural foods is becoming more and more mainstream for many people. So it's really broad based when you look at where the growth is. And we're trying all kinds of new things to make these types of products more available to our customers every day. On Vitacost, we love what we have. And it's a solid platform, and we plan to do other things with that over time. And I think you'll be seeing some things in the near future.\n\n---\n\nOkay, all right, fair enough. And then just as a follow-up maybe switching over quickly to Harris Teeter. Are all Harris Teeter stores now having the click-and-collect capability? And also, I know that you started in your Harris Teeter banner in one region. Any further plans for rollout that you could talk to for this year, this coming year?\n\n---\n\nWell, we are doing a -- we're still at beta test in 1 store here in Cincinnati, but at Harris Teeter, we're at about 160-some stores that are currently offering that to the customer. And I'll tell you what, the growth is exciting. Customers love the service, and the numbers continue to grow. We're setting new records at Harris Teeter all the time on more customers shopping this -- in this way. And it's a big part of our strategy going forward.\n\n---\n\nSo my question is actually more strategic. As we kind of take a step back, you said a couple things, $3.5 billion of investment in price kind of ongoing. I think, Mike Schlotman, you said you pushed up that CapEx growth rate a little bit again, so my question really goes to the top line growth of this organization. I mean, is it time we accelerated it further? It seems like it's gone on a little bit, but I mean, is it time we continue to push? I was talking to one investor, who said, \"Kroger is kind of the Costco of the grocery industry at this stage, where they continuously reinvest.\" So what's your thought? I mean, is the growth rate -- what should we think of as an ongoing top line growth rate? Can it go higher? How do we get it higher? Is this something the company is thinking about?\n\n---\n\nWell, Scott, it's a great question. And it's certainly something we think about. And the investor you were talking to, please pass along our appreciation for the compliment because we have a great deal of respect for Costco. We think about it a lot. In terms of -- I guess, I would really say, use your model to figure out how to accelerate the growth. As you know, we continue to accelerate the number of new stores, and we continue to try to make sure that our identical store sales stay strong. So I think that would automatically cause a continuation of an increasing growth rate, but we've spent a tremendous amount of energy and efforts on trying to accelerate our growth at a pace that makes sense for our organization. And one of the keys is we have to make sure we develop associates to be able to handle the accelerated growth as well.\n\n---\n\nAnd since there -- and we've talked about this before, Rodney, and I appreciate that answer. There's kind of become a Kroger way, a Kroger model driven by, I think, your just advantage in big data. How do you get that model into more consumers' hands in markets maybe that you're not in? I mean it -- you really haven't expanded. I guess Harris Teeter did it for you, but I mean, do you agree that there's a superior model now and it would be advantageous for the company to bring it to more markets?\n\n---\n\nI was going to answer the question until you said the last part. The...\n\n---\n\nWe'll still let him answer, though.\n\n---\n\nThe -- I -- we wouldn't ever think that we have a superior way. And all we're really focused on is how to get a little bit better tomorrow than we were yesterday. And for us, that would probably be the biggest part of the Kroger way is really trying to understand what the customers' wants and needs are and trying to get a little bit better at delivering against those. The -- and over time, and numerous times, we've said, anything that's available out there, you should assume that we've looked at it. And it's really making sure that we find something that adds value for our shareholders and something that we think the teams fit in well with Kroger and we can do something for the customer that they don't already have. And when you look at Harris Teeter, it checked all those boxes. And the Harris Teeter team was just amazing, but on smaller scale, Vitacost has been the same way. And a real small scale, YOU Tech has been the same thing. So it's really we're constantly trying to look at things that add new growth for us.\n\n---\n\nI was hoping you -- sort of a broad follow-up question from what everybody else has been asking. 2014, you guys have characterized as a somewhat unusually good year. Can you sort of walk us through some of the things that could continue, sort of puts and takes on 2015, and why or why not it could or could not be another unusually kind of good year? And sort of the areas I was hoping you would cover is things like the comp contribution from natural foods. Is that slowing in 2015 versus 2014? The competitive environment seemed to maybe be a little less competitive in 2014 for a lot of food retailers. What does that feel like right now as you look out? And then maybe a little more color on the puts and takes on inflation. Is there anything that could keep inflation from decelerating sequentially as you move through the year? And then the fourth part would be customer trade-up. Was that a significant support to your accelerating comps in 2014? And could that continue in 2015 as a driver?\n\n---\n\nOkay, one very long question. If I ask you to repeat parts of those -- I was trying to scribble them down. And as everybody here at Kroger knows, when I write slowly, it's hard to read my penmanship. Rodney took them -- took better notes, apparently. The first point on what -- the broad question. We obviously get very thoughtful and step back pretty far when we think about where we should set our expectations for a particular year. We become very careful and protective of the overall business model that we've developed, and that's focused on the customer as front and center. And as we decide what EBITDA growth rate and earnings per share growth rate is appropriate to ask our divisions and our different operating units to generate during a particular fiscal year, that's first and foremost. We really don't start necessarily with, \"Here is what the answer has to be.\" It's, \"What can the answer be? And how do we actually build a model that winds up generating that?\" From a comp standpoint, there's numbers of factors that can go into where the IDs can wind up being. One of those that you mentioned was inflation. We are expecting a little bit less inflation. That said, as you know, we have a very large and robust pharmacy business. That was a huge driver of the LIFO charge this year. Where that winds up in 2015 is purely a guess at this point. As I've said oftentimes, if we've done nothing else, the ability to predict the LIFO charge is something that is difficult, at best. You mentioned competition. I don't think competition is benign by any stretch of the imagination, but I'd say it's relatively consistent. It's always highly competitive. You never know what a competitor is going to do. We certainly assume that the current competitive condition is not going to get better than it is today. And it's always been a highly competitive industry. There's always new people trying to take part of your business that have different operating models, whether it's a Sprouts or those kinds of operators; or Publix coming into Charlotte like they have, trying to take part of Harris Teeter's business. And we build a model to defend our turf no matter where those folks try to come. When you look at customer trade-up, I would say it's somewhat -- there's a lot of things out there that are affecting broad customer base. Certainly, I think we probably would have seen some trade-up from the customer who has been less affected by the downturn in the economy over the last several years, probably spending a little bit more money in a variety of outlets, certainly some of ours. I would say, that customer who's been on a budget for the last several years, they probably aren't spending a whole lot more money on being big contributors to a consumer-driven economy. They're probably able to take care of some of the bills that they manage on a monthly basis, trying to remember which one they're going to push off for a little while. And they probably have been able to be a little bit more current on their bills but not a whole lot more disposable income. So it's a pretty big mixed bag out there. The -- certainly, the -- where fuel costs are going to wind up and a whole lot of other factors enter into it, but it's -- I know I've been going on for a bit here, but it's a long and difficult -- one, the question was long, but it's -- there's not a precise answer to say, \"It's A and B, and that's what drives the final answer.\" We've taken lot of factors as we plan the year and think about how it's going to wind up being.\n\n---\n\nThat's very helpful, Mike. Just the one area, just the one last area that I want to ask about. So on natural foods, you guys had big increases in square footage allocation to that space, very noticeable the last couple of years. I think that's slowed a lot. Should we expect less tailwind from natural foods to your comps in 2015 versus what you'd seen in the last couple of years?\n\n---\n\nI think you're going to continue to see great growth in natural foods. It's more a way of life for our customer today.\n\n---\n\nYes. The other thing is that, in certain categories, we're starting to integrate it rather than putting it in a separate space as well.\n\n---\n\nA couple. Can you help us a bit with how QTD comp trends are proceeding either quantitatively or qualitatively? And I guess, similarly, on 1Q fuel margins to date, any sort of flow-through margin help? Or have retail prices come down enough to maybe offset wholesale ones by this point?\n\n---\n\nIf you look at our identical sales so far this quarter, and obviously it's very early in the year because we're just a few weeks into the year, it would be slightly ahead of where we -- the guidance we gave. But it's very early in the year. On fuel margins, I'll -- Mike, we'll have to let you answer that one because I don't know the answer to that one.\n\n---\n\nYes, I don't think we need to talk about weekly fuel margins. It's difficult enough to predict what the year is going to be, let alone 4 or 5 weeks, because it's such a volatile area and just won't go down that path this morning.\n\n---\n\nThat's fair. And my follow-up is you're guiding to inflation being about 1.5% lower than it was in '14. You're talking about maybe a roughly 1.5% deceleration in total ID sales x fuel. So always risky embarrassing myself asking a simple math question, but is it fair to assume your guidance is thus implying that everything outside passing along inflation, like sort of traffic and basket size, you're expecting that to grow at a similar rate in '15 as '14, roughly?\n\n---\n\nYes, as Mike Ellis said in his remarks, we had great tonnage growth throughout the year, and it accelerated a little bit in the fourth quarter. And we don't see any reason why that would slow down during the year. And it's it winds up being in our hands to continue that underlying unit growth.\n\n---\n\nJust first, wanted to double check on guidance. So I think the message for next year is you had the very strong benefit from the fuel margins in the back half, but you have lower LIFO, no -- none of the pension. You don't cycle that pension expense again next year and the foundation expense. And so net-net, you still can kind of maintain that 8% to 11% earnings growth, but it sounds like fuel still may be somewhat of a headwind. So I don't know if you can maybe parse out the net impact of those factors that were kind of swing factors this year just to help us kind of think about how -- the guidance for 2015.\n\n---\n\nYes, you -- if you look at where fuel margins benefited us, and we talked about what the fuel margins were for the year, you know roughly what our gallons are over time, so you can probably figure out the incremental benefit from a margin standpoint on fuel. So if you think about that normalizing and then LIFO being -- expectation being lower, not having the pension contribution or the contribution to the charitable foundation, they don't perfectly offset one another but they come close to being -- negating one another, and that's why we're growing off of the $3.52 at the 8% to 11%. Keep in mind, all of that information aside, our core operations without those would have been at the high end of our 8% to 11% range all by themselves last year. And it's really that underlying strength in the core business that gives us the comfort to be able to have another great year in the 8% to 11% range.\n\n---\n\nPerfect, that's very helpful. And then just on the comps for the quarter. I think, when you were planning the comps for the quarter in Q3, you talked about cycling the benefit from the weather. Just curious what really came in better than expected for the fourth quarter in terms of those core ID comps. Was there a weather benefit? Or did you just kind of hang onto some of those customers that maybe were pushed into your stores last year with the weather? Or just curious, thoughts there.\n\n---\n\nYes, we -- the weather would not have been as helpful this year as it was prior year. So it was really hanging onto some of those customers and really the operating and merchandising teams doing a great job of making sure that we had strong programs to cycle that weather. So it was really the team executing and doing a great job.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And we'll take one more question.\n\n---\n\nWanted to get some thoughts on, now that you're contemplating more of these fill-in markets, what should we be thinking about for a longer-term square footage growth rate for you? Because you have been fading off of your store closures, so I'm curious what the flow-through is going to be on actual net square footage growth.\n\n---\n\nYes, it's really difficult to predict exactly how many operational closings you're going to have in a particular year. And there's a wide variety of reasons those happen, but if you look at our gross, we expect it to be 2% to 2.5% next year. Our net was a little bit under 1% last year. Our store count has been down. Keep in mind, sometimes when we close an underperforming store, we may be closing an underperforming store, it's underperforming because its sales per square foot are at the way low end of a range of what would make that store profitable. And as we replace that store or open a new store that's larger than that, the net square footage may not go up dramatically, but the sales per square foot of that new store can often be several multiples of the store we closed. So it's a little misleading just to say, \"Oh, square footage growth hasn't been that much so they can't grow sales that much.\" The difference between that productivity of the new store and the store we closed can be quite remarkable sometimes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And were there any tax implications from the charitable contribution in the fourth quarter, or anything that carries into 2015?\n\n---\n\nNo. Obviously, we got a tax deduction for that, but it didn't affect the tax rate in any way, shape or form. And we've just taken advantage of the opportunity of a very strong year to be able to continue to have dollars to support the efforts that we support, both that are important to us and are important to our customers.\n\n---\n\nI want to thank everybody for calling in today and listening to our call. And before we end the call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today.\r\nI'd like to thank all of our associates for their hard work and dedication in serving our customers. We finished 2014 strong, thanks to your commitment in providing friendly service and fresh products to our 8 million customers every time, every day. Thank you to each and every one of you for making a difference with our customers and for each other.\r\nAs many of you know, our community service awards honor and recognize our associates who, through their widespread volunteer activity, charitable involvement and leadership, make a difference in the communities where we live, work and raise our families. Nominations for our 2014 community service awards are now being accepted. Whether you support the hungry, veterans and active-duty military, cancer awareness or your favorite local organization, I encourage you to apply and -- or nominate a coworker for this prestigious award. Winners from each division will receive a donation to their charity of choice. Make sure you connect with your HR manager for more information and nomination deadlines in your division.\r\nThank you for all you do. Your work in our communities is simply amazing.\r\nThat completes our call for today. Thanks for joining.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nSo guys, a few things. I think you said $3.5 billion of annual investment in price. Was that right? And what do you include in there? Is that merely price reductions, promotions or something else? Is that sustainable? Do you think you can do $3.5 billion a year? And then what happens to the elasticity of the return over time if the returns remain high on that investment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes, that's $3.5 billion, John, that you heard us talk about. Yes, that's an annual number. And that's the annual number in 2014. Now if you look at -- obviously, we started the journey about 10 years ago of taking cost out of the business and taking that -- as we take cost out of the business, giving the customer better value both in everyday price and promotional. We would -- we see it as our strategy to continue that as we take costs out of the business. We'll continue to give that to the customer in a combination of service and price based on what we see the opportunities to be. We are very satisfied with the elasticity of the demand side as we invest in price. Obviously, we have a tremendous amount of data that we have developed internally to make sure that we're investing that in the right place where we get the best return. So we would see it sustainable, and it is part of our continued strategy. I don't know, Mike. Anything you want to add?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nNo, I think that's it, Rodney.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nOkay, so as far as you can tell, there's enough things to invest in that the return will remain -- you think it will remain what it's been, as far as the eye can see, it sounds like.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nAbsolutely. And every category would have different results, and that's one of the values of our insight is understanding that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nAll right. And then just one for Mike Schlotman. I know you guys have liked a front-end-loaded buyback program, right, for the productivity that gives you throughout the year. Is that the idea this year? Is that sort of embedded in the guidance, that a lot of it will be done in the first half?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, I would say the day-to-day market conditions will wind up dictating when we make those investments, but I would point out the fact that, at the end of -- when we had our conference call in December, we had not used any of the $500 million buyback authorization. And from my comments today, we have used some now.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rupesh Parikh (Analysts)】\nSo I just want to start maybe with the center store trends. We've heard from a number of large CPG players just about challenges in the -- some of the center store categories. So I wanted to get a sense whether you guys are seeing the same thing. Or any more color what's happening there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nWell, actually, our center store has performed better in the fourth quarter than it had in other quarters in 2014. And we've done a lot of work in relaying our center store, getting things refreshed, new products in. And it's been a big focus of us to using customer insights and really going through our stores and doing the work that's around assortment that's really effective.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThe other thing that's -- a lot of the CPGs would have something different than what we would have is, a lot of the natural food items, do you include that in center store or a separate department? And it's getting increasingly complicated because there are certain categories where natural foods is almost as big as the historical business. So it's a short question but hard to answer. And for us, we're all -- we're completely focused on what it is the customer wants.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rupesh Parikh (Analysts)】\nAnd then switching gears maybe to the Simple Truth brand. You achieved your targets this year for sales of more than $1 billion. Do you have any new targets out there? And is it getting more difficult to get the supply for that business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nSupply has been an issue in certain areas, but when you have over 2,600 items, we have a great base of product today, and we're going to continue to expand that. But for the most part, in some of the perishable areas, there's been a supply issue or 2, but we've been able to really take care of the customer. And I don't foresee anything this year in the near future.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes, but certain categories will always have some tightness on supply, especially at the front end, as farmers transition over to growing more of the organic or natural product.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nOkay, I have made -- and this is a question for Mike. Do you...\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWhich one?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nRight, that's right. Mike Schlotman. Question about labor negotiations. The very strong performance of the company, do you think that makes it harder for you to get the unions to go along with what you want? Or are they -- maybe a better -- bigger question is, are they pushing for wage increases?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nOur -- if you look at our average wage of our hourly associates in the store, it's nearly $14 an hour. And if you look at the total benefit package our associates enjoy, it's even stronger than that. It varies, obviously, by geography and particular contracts, but we've been on the forefront not only with a good solid wage. We've had -- we've been very upfront with the unions and have done a lot of things to protect the future pension benefits of our associates, what -- which others aren't doing out there. It's not just the big one we did 2 or 3 years ago. We did some more smaller ones in the first quarter this year, and it wouldn't surprise me if there'll be others that we wind up doing in the future. If you look overall, we are adding jobs. And we added 25,000 jobs last year. We're up to 400,000 jobs. One of the things that we like to say around Kroger is, a lot of people, particularly part-time workers that are under 18, they come to Kroger looking for a job, and they stay for a career. If you look around the ranks of our store managers, 2/3 of them started out as hourly, part-time hourly associates in our store. And that really just talks to the fabric of Kroger and how well we treat our associates overall. So it's more than just about the wages. There's a lot more behind the scenes of what those associates look for when they come to Kroger.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nPlus what you make today is something different than you'll make in a -- as you get promoted throughout your career and take on more responsibility.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nRight.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nAnd then changing gears, maybe just talk a little bit about the test you have of click and collect in Cincinnati. Maybe it's too early to say anything, but are you feeling good about how that's going?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nWell, it is too early to really to say anything, Meredith, but the learnings that we have from Harris Teeter is really helping us develop our plans on how we're going to go forward. And Harris Teeter has had a very successful business for -- well, they started over 10 years ago in the click-and-collect world. And we've learned a lot, and it's really helping us accelerate our learning and growth.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nJust a little color, I guess, following on John Heinbockel's question. In terms of share buybacks, obviously, your guidance for fiscal '15 is very strong given the tailwind that you're going to have in gas margins. So, I mean, maybe a little color on how much of this is buyback related versus core EBIT growth. I don't know if you can just elaborate a little bit on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, I won't get that granular on the model. From an expectation standpoint, you should have the expectation we'll probably spend a little bit less on share buyback during -- in terms of dollars in 2015 versus 2014. We are increasing our expectations for capital spend by a few hundred million dollars more just because of the great pipeline of projects I spoke of in the prepared comments. And that's what we think, we would believe, is the driver for growth in the future. Keep in mind, back in October of '12, we said, for the first couple of years of this new growth model, we would have 25 -- 1/4 to 1/3 of our EPS growth may come from share buybacks, but that would decline over time as we continue to open successful stores in our fill-in markets.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nOkay, that's helpful. And then just looking at the year in general. So when I look at obviously how strong this year was, can you maybe try to frame how much of that was Harris Teeter related in terms of Harris Teeter outperforming what your original guidance was on accretion? I mean, obviously, let's exclude fuel from the conversation. And then just following on that is, when we start to model comps throughout the year, any color on how we should think of how Harris Teeter, now that it's in the comp base, how that'll impact the comps throughout the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWell, I won't give specifics on Harris Teeter. I would say that they added a little bit more to earnings per share than our original expectations for the year. They had a phenomenal year. They also helped the core Kroger with some ideas that they have done historically and helped the core Kroger have a very strong year as well. Relative to the comp cadence throughout the year, even though we only had Harris Teeter as a business for this year, we included them in our comp base all year using their 2013 sales. So the sales numbers we reported during 2014 actually included Harris Teeter as though we had owned them in 2013. So there won't be a big inflection point in ID sales from including Harris Teeter going forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Karen Short (Analysts)】\nEven though the comps might have been pressured from investing in price?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nThey -- again, their ID sales were included in our 2014 results, so going forward, they'll continue to be in there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nKaren, what I would -- I'm just going to add to Mike's thing. If you look at -- Harris Teeter delivered more than we were expecting, and that was driven because of their strong operations and synergies, but -- fuel obviously drove it, but if you look at core Kroger even without those 2 items, we still exceeded as well. So it's really all 3 pieces that drove the strong results.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nThe first question, just for Mike Schlotman. On the cadence of the EPS growth next year, Mike, you mentioned Q1 being in line with the range for the year. I guess I would have thought that maybe it would have been better because the fuel comparison's obviously easier there. You still get the benefit from the repo in the first quarter and the share count. And then I would imagine that your comps are probably stronger earlier in the year than later. Could you just maybe help us understand why Q1 would be -- would just be in line?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nAt this point, that's -- we had a very, very strong first quarter last year, so we are comping off of that. I agree that there will still be some residual benefit in the first quarter from the share buyback, but that was very front-end loaded last year. And we'll -- and as I said earlier, we'll buy less shares back this year than last year. So the combination of those, the way we bought it back last year did hit -- help the first quarter a bit. It's -- a lot of it winds up depending on a huge number of factors. And we just recently finalized our business plan by quarter based off of how the year wound up and what our expectations are for the various quarters. And the best answer I can give you is we're trying to be transparent about how our operators and so forth feel about the cadence throughout the year, and that's what our expectations are. There's a lot of factors that go into it. LIFO certainly will play a factor of how and when we get expense charges in the quarter. As you know, we increased our LIFO charge throughout the year and then it came down in the fourth quarter. So if our estimate for LIFO is accurate this year, second and third quarter will be helped a little bit by a lower LIFO charge as compared to the prior year. So there's lots of things that wind up going into building that model.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Kelly (Analysts)】\nAnd then just a follow-up, and this is just on your IDs generally. Your IDs typically have outpaced the industry for a very long time, but it does seem like, more recently, that this gap has widened. And I guess what I'm trying to ask you is, is there anything that you can identify, do you think, that's driven that acceleration? For instance, you saw a -- the windfall in fuel in the back half. Have you been able to use some of those proceeds to help you around the pricing front, as -- and other things that have maybe helped this acceleration in the outperformance to the industry?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nEd, it's a question that actually we have spent a little bit of time trying to think through internally. And probably the biggest thing is our associates, our store teams and their -- and all the people that's work our stores. They continue to do a better job of serving -- helping serve our customers on a daily basis, everything from making sure products are fresher to making sure that we treat our customers right. And we really do believe we had a great foundation in place, and our associates really are taking it up to the next level in terms of how they're taking care of our customers. And we think that that's what's -- the thing that's really been successful, and we really appreciate what our associates are doing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vincent Sinisi (Analysts)】\nWanted to ask about natural organic, which as you mentioned, of course, continues to see some nice growth, Simple Truth being the main contributor to that. But outside of Simple Truth, can you give any other color in terms of maybe some other category or brand growth within it? And in particular, maybe any early just color around Vitacost, any cross-selling or expansion there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nGreat question. Within natural foods, there are so many categories that customers are connecting with today that get stronger and stronger, from dairy products, gluten-free. We can go on and on. And our ability to cross-merchandise some of those products throughout the store, I think, has made some of those products more available in a broader way to a larger customer base. We keep talking about the blurring of departments, and natural foods is becoming more and more mainstream for many people. So it's really broad based when you look at where the growth is. And we're trying all kinds of new things to make these types of products more available to our customers every day. On Vitacost, we love what we have. And it's a solid platform, and we plan to do other things with that over time. And I think you'll be seeing some things in the near future.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vincent Sinisi (Analysts)】\nOkay, all right, fair enough. And then just as a follow-up maybe switching over quickly to Harris Teeter. Are all Harris Teeter stores now having the click-and-collect capability? And also, I know that you started in your Harris Teeter banner in one region. Any further plans for rollout that you could talk to for this year, this coming year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nWell, we are doing a -- we're still at beta test in 1 store here in Cincinnati, but at Harris Teeter, we're at about 160-some stores that are currently offering that to the customer. And I'll tell you what, the growth is exciting. Customers love the service, and the numbers continue to grow. We're setting new records at Harris Teeter all the time on more customers shopping this -- in this way. And it's a big part of our strategy going forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nSo my question is actually more strategic. As we kind of take a step back, you said a couple things, $3.5 billion of investment in price kind of ongoing. I think, Mike Schlotman, you said you pushed up that CapEx growth rate a little bit again, so my question really goes to the top line growth of this organization. I mean, is it time we accelerated it further? It seems like it's gone on a little bit, but I mean, is it time we continue to push? I was talking to one investor, who said, \"Kroger is kind of the Costco of the grocery industry at this stage, where they continuously reinvest.\" So what's your thought? I mean, is the growth rate -- what should we think of as an ongoing top line growth rate? Can it go higher? How do we get it higher? Is this something the company is thinking about?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nWell, Scott, it's a great question. And it's certainly something we think about. And the investor you were talking to, please pass along our appreciation for the compliment because we have a great deal of respect for Costco. We think about it a lot. In terms of -- I guess, I would really say, use your model to figure out how to accelerate the growth. As you know, we continue to accelerate the number of new stores, and we continue to try to make sure that our identical store sales stay strong. So I think that would automatically cause a continuation of an increasing growth rate, but we've spent a tremendous amount of energy and efforts on trying to accelerate our growth at a pace that makes sense for our organization. And one of the keys is we have to make sure we develop associates to be able to handle the accelerated growth as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nAnd since there -- and we've talked about this before, Rodney, and I appreciate that answer. There's kind of become a Kroger way, a Kroger model driven by, I think, your just advantage in big data. How do you get that model into more consumers' hands in markets maybe that you're not in? I mean it -- you really haven't expanded. I guess Harris Teeter did it for you, but I mean, do you agree that there's a superior model now and it would be advantageous for the company to bring it to more markets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nI was going to answer the question until you said the last part. The...\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nWe'll still let him answer, though.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nThe -- I -- we wouldn't ever think that we have a superior way. And all we're really focused on is how to get a little bit better tomorrow than we were yesterday. And for us, that would probably be the biggest part of the Kroger way is really trying to understand what the customers' wants and needs are and trying to get a little bit better at delivering against those. The -- and over time, and numerous times, we've said, anything that's available out there, you should assume that we've looked at it. And it's really making sure that we find something that adds value for our shareholders and something that we think the teams fit in well with Kroger and we can do something for the customer that they don't already have. And when you look at Harris Teeter, it checked all those boxes. And the Harris Teeter team was just amazing, but on smaller scale, Vitacost has been the same way. And a real small scale, YOU Tech has been the same thing. So it's really we're constantly trying to look at things that add new growth for us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nI was hoping you -- sort of a broad follow-up question from what everybody else has been asking. 2014, you guys have characterized as a somewhat unusually good year. Can you sort of walk us through some of the things that could continue, sort of puts and takes on 2015, and why or why not it could or could not be another unusually kind of good year? And sort of the areas I was hoping you would cover is things like the comp contribution from natural foods. Is that slowing in 2015 versus 2014? The competitive environment seemed to maybe be a little less competitive in 2014 for a lot of food retailers. What does that feel like right now as you look out? And then maybe a little more color on the puts and takes on inflation. Is there anything that could keep inflation from decelerating sequentially as you move through the year? And then the fourth part would be customer trade-up. Was that a significant support to your accelerating comps in 2014? And could that continue in 2015 as a driver?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nOkay, one very long question. If I ask you to repeat parts of those -- I was trying to scribble them down. And as everybody here at Kroger knows, when I write slowly, it's hard to read my penmanship. Rodney took them -- took better notes, apparently. The first point on what -- the broad question. We obviously get very thoughtful and step back pretty far when we think about where we should set our expectations for a particular year. We become very careful and protective of the overall business model that we've developed, and that's focused on the customer as front and center. And as we decide what EBITDA growth rate and earnings per share growth rate is appropriate to ask our divisions and our different operating units to generate during a particular fiscal year, that's first and foremost. We really don't start necessarily with, \"Here is what the answer has to be.\" It's, \"What can the answer be? And how do we actually build a model that winds up generating that?\" From a comp standpoint, there's numbers of factors that can go into where the IDs can wind up being. One of those that you mentioned was inflation. We are expecting a little bit less inflation. That said, as you know, we have a very large and robust pharmacy business. That was a huge driver of the LIFO charge this year. Where that winds up in 2015 is purely a guess at this point. As I've said oftentimes, if we've done nothing else, the ability to predict the LIFO charge is something that is difficult, at best. You mentioned competition. I don't think competition is benign by any stretch of the imagination, but I'd say it's relatively consistent. It's always highly competitive. You never know what a competitor is going to do. We certainly assume that the current competitive condition is not going to get better than it is today. And it's always been a highly competitive industry. There's always new people trying to take part of your business that have different operating models, whether it's a Sprouts or those kinds of operators; or Publix coming into Charlotte like they have, trying to take part of Harris Teeter's business. And we build a model to defend our turf no matter where those folks try to come. When you look at customer trade-up, I would say it's somewhat -- there's a lot of things out there that are affecting broad customer base. Certainly, I think we probably would have seen some trade-up from the customer who has been less affected by the downturn in the economy over the last several years, probably spending a little bit more money in a variety of outlets, certainly some of ours. I would say, that customer who's been on a budget for the last several years, they probably aren't spending a whole lot more money on being big contributors to a consumer-driven economy. They're probably able to take care of some of the bills that they manage on a monthly basis, trying to remember which one they're going to push off for a little while. And they probably have been able to be a little bit more current on their bills but not a whole lot more disposable income. So it's a pretty big mixed bag out there. The -- certainly, the -- where fuel costs are going to wind up and a whole lot of other factors enter into it, but it's -- I know I've been going on for a bit here, but it's a long and difficult -- one, the question was long, but it's -- there's not a precise answer to say, \"It's A and B, and that's what drives the final answer.\" We've taken lot of factors as we plan the year and think about how it's going to wind up being.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nThat's very helpful, Mike. Just the one area, just the one last area that I want to ask about. So on natural foods, you guys had big increases in square footage allocation to that space, very noticeable the last couple of years. I think that's slowed a lot. Should we expect less tailwind from natural foods to your comps in 2015 versus what you'd seen in the last couple of years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ellis (Executives)】\nI think you're going to continue to see great growth in natural foods. It's more a way of life for our customer today.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes. The other thing is that, in certain categories, we're starting to integrate it rather than putting it in a separate space as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenneth Goldman (Analysts)】\nA couple. Can you help us a bit with how QTD comp trends are proceeding either quantitatively or qualitatively? And I guess, similarly, on 1Q fuel margins to date, any sort of flow-through margin help? Or have retail prices come down enough to maybe offset wholesale ones by this point?\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nIf you look at our identical sales so far this quarter, and obviously it's very early in the year because we're just a few weeks into the year, it would be slightly ahead of where we -- the guidance we gave. But it's very early in the year. On fuel margins, I'll -- Mike, we'll have to let you answer that one because I don't know the answer to that one.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, I don't think we need to talk about weekly fuel margins. It's difficult enough to predict what the year is going to be, let alone 4 or 5 weeks, because it's such a volatile area and just won't go down that path this morning.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenneth Goldman (Analysts)】\nThat's fair. And my follow-up is you're guiding to inflation being about 1.5% lower than it was in '14. You're talking about maybe a roughly 1.5% deceleration in total ID sales x fuel. So always risky embarrassing myself asking a simple math question, but is it fair to assume your guidance is thus implying that everything outside passing along inflation, like sort of traffic and basket size, you're expecting that to grow at a similar rate in '15 as '14, roughly?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, as Mike Ellis said in his remarks, we had great tonnage growth throughout the year, and it accelerated a little bit in the fourth quarter. And we don't see any reason why that would slow down during the year. And it's it winds up being in our hands to continue that underlying unit growth.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kelly Bania (Analysts)】\nJust first, wanted to double check on guidance. So I think the message for next year is you had the very strong benefit from the fuel margins in the back half, but you have lower LIFO, no -- none of the pension. You don't cycle that pension expense again next year and the foundation expense. And so net-net, you still can kind of maintain that 8% to 11% earnings growth, but it sounds like fuel still may be somewhat of a headwind. So I don't know if you can maybe parse out the net impact of those factors that were kind of swing factors this year just to help us kind of think about how -- the guidance for 2015.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, you -- if you look at where fuel margins benefited us, and we talked about what the fuel margins were for the year, you know roughly what our gallons are over time, so you can probably figure out the incremental benefit from a margin standpoint on fuel. So if you think about that normalizing and then LIFO being -- expectation being lower, not having the pension contribution or the contribution to the charitable foundation, they don't perfectly offset one another but they come close to being -- negating one another, and that's why we're growing off of the $3.52 at the 8% to 11%. Keep in mind, all of that information aside, our core operations without those would have been at the high end of our 8% to 11% range all by themselves last year. And it's really that underlying strength in the core business that gives us the comfort to be able to have another great year in the 8% to 11% range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kelly Bania (Analysts)】\nPerfect, that's very helpful. And then just on the comps for the quarter. I think, when you were planning the comps for the quarter in Q3, you talked about cycling the benefit from the weather. Just curious what really came in better than expected for the fourth quarter in terms of those core ID comps. Was there a weather benefit? Or did you just kind of hang onto some of those customers that maybe were pushed into your stores last year with the weather? Or just curious, thoughts there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nYes, we -- the weather would not have been as helpful this year as it was prior year. So it was really hanging onto some of those customers and really the operating and merchandising teams doing a great job of making sure that we had strong programs to cycle that weather. So it was really the team executing and doing a great job.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nOkay. And we'll take one more question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Wiltamuth (Analysts)】\nWanted to get some thoughts on, now that you're contemplating more of these fill-in markets, what should we be thinking about for a longer-term square footage growth rate for you? Because you have been fading off of your store closures, so I'm curious what the flow-through is going to be on actual net square footage growth.\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nYes, it's really difficult to predict exactly how many operational closings you're going to have in a particular year. And there's a wide variety of reasons those happen, but if you look at our gross, we expect it to be 2% to 2.5% next year. Our net was a little bit under 1% last year. Our store count has been down. Keep in mind, sometimes when we close an underperforming store, we may be closing an underperforming store, it's underperforming because its sales per square foot are at the way low end of a range of what would make that store profitable. And as we replace that store or open a new store that's larger than that, the net square footage may not go up dramatically, but the sales per square foot of that new store can often be several multiples of the store we closed. So it's a little misleading just to say, \"Oh, square footage growth hasn't been that much so they can't grow sales that much.\" The difference between that productivity of the new store and the store we closed can be quite remarkable sometimes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Wiltamuth (Analysts)】\nOkay. And were there any tax implications from the charitable contribution in the fourth quarter, or anything that carries into 2015?\n\n---\n\n【回答: J. Schlotman (Executives)】\nNo. Obviously, we got a tax deduction for that, but it didn't affect the tax rate in any way, shape or form. And we've just taken advantage of the opportunity of a very strong year to be able to continue to have dollars to support the efforts that we support, both that are important to us and are important to our customers.\n\n---\n\n【回答: W. McMullen (Executives)】\nI want to thank everybody for calling in today and listening to our call. And before we end the call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today.\r\nI'd like to thank all of our associates for their hard work and dedication in serving our customers. We finished 2014 strong, thanks to your commitment in providing friendly service and fresh products to our 8 million customers every time, every day.

      "transcript_text1": "Good morning. This is Joyce Brooks, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today's call for a discussion of McCormick's first quarter financial results and our current outlook for 2015. We've posted a set of slides to accompany our call at ir.mccormick.com. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded.\r\nWith me this morning are Alan Wilson, Chairman and CEO; Gordon Stetz, Executive Vice President and CFO; Lawrence Kurzius, Chief Operating Officer and President; and Mike Smith, Senior Vice President, Finance, Capital Markets and CFO North America.\r\nDuring our remarks, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. These include adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the impact of special charges, as well as information in constant currency, which we've formerly referred to as local currency. A reconciliation to the GAAP results is included in this morning's press release and slides.\r\nAs a reminder, today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors. As seen on Slide 2, our forward-looking statement also provides information on risk factors that could affect our financial results.\r\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Alan.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Joyce. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. McCormick's first quarter results demonstrated progress with our growth strategies and our actions to reduce cost. While sales rose 2%, the growth rate was 6% in constant currency, with a mid-single digit increase in each of our 2 segments. These increases were largely driven by volume and product mix. Special charges, along with currency, had an adverse impact on our operating income result. In fact, we now anticipate a more significant impact from both special charges and currency this year, as Gordon will discuss as part of our 2015 outlook.\r\nExcluding both of these factors, adjusted operating income rose 1%. We expect this growth rate to improve once our 2015 pricing actions are fully in place and the benefits of our aggressive cost-reduction activity begin to build.\r\nEarnings per share this quarter were $0.55, and excluding special charges, grew to $0.70 from $0.62 in the year-ago period. This was largely the result of a favorable tax rate and higher income from unconsolidated operations.\r\nThe 2014 success of our joint venture in Mexico continues in 2015, with sales up 7% and increased profit margins.\r\nWe generated strong cash flow as we kicked off the year and returned cash to shareholders through dividends and through share repurchases that lowered our average shares outstanding by 2% year-on-year. Based on these results and our latest 2015 outlook, we're reaffirming our expected growth rate for sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share on a constant-currency basis. Gordon will share the details of our quarterly results and outlook. \r\nI want to comment on each of our business segments. First, our consumer business. We grew sales for this segment 1% and, in constant currency, by 5%. In the U.S., we continue to gain share of recipe mixes, while in spices and seasonings, we still see robust category growth, but we still have some work to do in this market.\r\nOur key initiatives in North America are innovation, building brand equity and category leadership at retail. Our innovation activity includes completing the rollout of McCormick's Skillet Sauces. We're pleased with the retailer acceptance and began advertising in the first quarter to build awareness and trial. The relaunch of our entire gourmet line is in full swing. Our brand-new look features greater variety, a flavor-seal technology that locks in flavor, color and aroma, and a packaging that has more premium fresh appearance.\r\nWe've also achieved good retail placement for our flavored sea salts and have new varieties of OLD BAY, Lawry's marinades, gluten-free recipe mixes and Zatarain's rice mixes. As we head into grilling season, we're gaining shelf space for our line -- new line of Grill Mates, burger mix and sauces, and a variety of seasonings such as Blue Moon blend, leveraging the popularity of this craft beer.\r\nWe're building brand equity in our U.S. market through both digital and traditional media, informed by our ROI analysis. We leveraged over 25 million impressions on Facebook over the holidays, and our engagement rates are up 25% from a year ago. We attribute this to the strength of our community, as well as the quality of our content, which includes user-generated photos and comments and step-by-step visuals.\r\nAs for digital shopper marketing, we partnered with retailers on a first quarter big game campaign that had an above-average conversion to purchase and 20% sales increase on advertised products. And to support our upcoming grilling campaign, we are launching 2 new television ads that capture the effort and passion that consumers apply when grilling.\r\nOur efforts to win at retail have included a sales force reorganization and customer category management leadership. Heading into 2015, we have a sharp focus on retail price points and are putting more advanced analytic rigor around pricing management.\r\nWhile price elasticity is low for many of our seasonal items, we've identified key staples that are price-sensitive. A major focus of our sales team is to target these key items and use existing trade promotion fronts and retailer negotiations to optimize shelf price thresholds.\r\nWe're also leveraging our gourmet relaunch to win at retail. Third-party analysis shows that greater product assortment is beneficial to the consumer shopping experience, but too many brands can be detrimental. Specifically, an increase in McCormick's gourmet product assortment led to an 8% increase in our sales and a 5% category increase. However, a shelf set with 3 brands resulted in a 13% drop in category buyers. The message for our customers is simple: Expand their product assortment of McCormick gourmet and discontinue competitive brands.\r\nOur win at retail efforts extend to e-commerce, and we've made particularly good progress with Amazon. McCormick has gained 4 share points at Amazon in the past 12 months, and our taco seasoning mix has been reported as the #2 item in prime pantry. Across each of these initiatives, innovation, brand building and winning at retail, we believe we have the right team and the right actions underway to improve our performance in spices and seasonings.\r\nFor our consumer business in China, we maintained the pace of double-digit sales growth this quarter, driven by brand-building activities, geographic expansion and great in-store execution. We also are realizing sales synergies with WAPC, now that the integration of this acquisition is basically complete. The opportunity for this cross-selling opportunity is illustrated on Slide 6, which depicts the core markets for our McCormick brand in the coastal regions and our WAPC Daqiao brand in Central China.\r\nBeyond China and the U.S., we grew constant-currency sales for our consumer business across a number of other markets this quarter, including France, Canada, Australia and Central America.\r\nLet's turn to our industrial business. We grew sales for this segment 3% and, in constant currency, by 7%. Each of our 3 regions had strong results. Our U.S. business led this growth with higher pricing related to commodity cost increases and increased demand for our branded food service products, as well as customized seasonings, largely for snacks.\r\nSuccess with innovation in partnership with leading snack companies was part of this growth. This innovation also drove industrial sales higher in Mexico this quarter. These increases more than offset weak sales to quick-service restaurants that is extended into 2015 in the Americas.\r\nIn EMEA, we have been growing sales to quick-service restaurants and we had a solid increase again this quarter. From facilities in the U.K., Turkey and South Africa, we supply a broad range of flavor solutions across this region. Our team in EMEA is not only growing sales, but improving profitability through greater efficiencies and a shift towards higher-margin products.\r\nWe're pleased with the return to sales growth in China, where the demand from quick-service restaurants has been volatile. In 2015, these customers are expecting a gradual improvement in sales. However, our first quarter sales rose at a double-digit rate due to a new limited-time menu items and increased sales of products that we manufacture in China for export to other Asian markets. Across both business segments, we continue to be encouraged by the global increase in demand for flavor.\r\nFlavor is well aligned with the broader changes in the way people are eating today; whether it's spicier food, eating more fresh produce and protein, simple ingredients are the move toward healthier eating. These are driving strong category growth rates in developed markets. And in emerging markets, we've added the benefit of the rise of middle-class consumers for seeking the safety and quality of branded spices and seasonings.\r\nThis increased demand for flavor underpins the growth of our current portfolio of leading brands and the breadth of flavor solutions across the entire food industry that we provide through our industrial business. It also supports acquisitions as another avenue of growth for McCormick. We've developed a strong record of adding profitable businesses to our portfolio, and we're pleased to recently announce 2 more.\r\nIn late February, we signed an agreement to purchase Drogheria & Alimentari for approximately EUR 50 million and a potential 2018 earn-out payment of up to EUR 35 million. As a supplier of both brand and private-label products, this business is a spice and seasoning leader in Italy, with approximately 1/3 of the category share. In addition, its products are exported to 60 other countries. We anticipate strong growth of this premium brand, particularly in the U.S. and key international markets, where consumers are seeking unique and authentic ethnic flavors.\r\nSince its founding in 1880, the owners and employees of Drogheria & Alimentari have built a great business, and we look forward to working with them to achieve continued success. We expect to complete this acquisition by midyear.\r\nIn early March, we acquired Brand Aromatics for $63 million, our first industrial acquisition in quite a few years. With Brand Aromatics, we expand our breadth of flavor solutions to value-added, natural-savory flavors, marinades and broth and stock concentrates. This business has packaged food customers that complement McCormick's industrial customers, as well as the USDA manufacturing facility and 40 employees that include an experienced product development team. We look forward to working with the employees of Brand Aromatics to drive growth and strengthen our customer intimacy.\r\nBeyond these recent announcements, we're actively pursuing a strong pipeline of other acquisition opportunities. We've added resources across our business to support this activity.\r\nIn our January call, I discussed the North American effectiveness initiative. This is more than a cost-reduction program. We currently have operating units for our consumer and industrial businesses in the U.S. and Canada that are comprised of both commercial and support functions. Through this initiative, we're moving to commercial units comprised of sales, marketing and R&D, and centralized support functions for groups like finance, human relations and supply chain. Our simplified commercial teams are focused on growth and innovation, and our support functions will be more effectively able to leverage scale and drive cost reductions.\r\nAs a part of this initiative, we are increasing spans of control and eliminating some senior positions, while adding analytical talent and new capabilities. We expect to simplify our decision-making process and execute faster to capture growth and profit opportunities. We anticipate a very good payback, with an estimated annual cost savings of $25 million and charges of about $25 million. In just 2 months since announcing this program, we've made significant progress toward this goal.\r\nBetween the EMEA project announced 18 months ago, our North American initiative and other actions, we expect to lower our annual selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by approximately 1 percentage point by 2016. We are confident that we can achieve further reductions to SG&A as a percentage of net sales through scale, our CCI program and future cost-reduction programs.\r\nTo summarize, our first quarter results have us off to a great start in 2015. I'm encouraged by our strong innovation pipeline, our brand-building activity and aggressive cost-reduction efforts. And we've announced 2 acquisitions that offer great growth opportunities. I'd like to recognize and thank McCormick employees around the world for their engagement and high performance that's driving our success.\r\nIt's now my pleasure to turn it over to Gordon.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. I will begin with a review of our first quarter financial results and then update you on our latest 2015 outlook.\r\nWe were pleased with our sales and profit performance in the first quarter. However, as with many other U.S.-based food companies with international operations, we had a significant headwind from currency this period. On a constant-currency basis, the underlying growth in sales was very strong at 6%. Our adjusted operating income excludes special charges and declined 2%, but if we also exclude currency, we achieved modest growth of 1%.\r\nLet's take a look at these results for each of our 2 segments. Slide 14 shows that we grew year-on-year consumer business sales 5% in constant currency, driven by higher volume and product mix. Sales in the Americas rose 5% in constant currency from the first quarter of 2014, mainly due to higher volume and product mix. As Alan indicated, the growth was in core items such as recipe mixes and Grill Mates.\r\nIn EMEA, consumer business sales in constant courtesy grew 2% as a result of growth in volume and product mix. This growth was led by France, as well as other smaller markets, and more than offsetting modest volume decline in the U.K. where we face a challenging retail environment.\r\nIn France, our brand marketing support and innovation drove increased sales both at core spices and seasonings, as well as homemade dessert products.\r\nIn constant currency, we grew consumer business sales in the Asia/Pacific region 10%, with a 13% increase in volume and product mix. This was led by sales in China, which rose 18%, mostly from higher volume and product mix. Constant-currency sales in Australia also rose this period, while sales in India declined due in part to lower prices in the market.\r\nIn total for the consumer business, adjusted operating income was $92 million compared to $94 million in the first quarter of 2014. In constant currency, adjusted operating income was comparable to the year-ago period, with the benefit of sales growth and cost savings offset by the unfavorable impact of material cost, retirement benefit expense and product mix. As we indicated in our January call, the increase in retirement benefit expense is mainly due to the noncash impact of a lower discount rate and new mortality table assumptions.\r\nOur brand marketing this period was up $1 million from the first quarter of 2014, and we also recorded $1 million in acquisition-related transaction cost for this business segment.\r\nTurning to our industrial business, we grew first quarter sales a robust 7% in constant currency from the year-ago period. Higher volume and product mix contributed 4 percentage points, and pricing actions taken in response to higher material costs added 3 percentage points.\r\nIn the Americas region, industrial business year-on-year sales rose 5% in constant currency, including the impact of pricing actions. We also grew volume and product mix. Throughout 2014, snack seasonings had been a source of strong growth, and this continues in 2015 with a strong pipeline of innovation. This performance, along with increased sales of branded food service products, more than offset continued weakness in sales to quick-service restaurant customers.\r\nIn our EMEA industrial business, we grew sales 9% in constant currency, with a 6% increase in volume and product mix. As Alan described, we are supporting the growth and geographic expansion of leading quick-service restaurants and food manufacturers in this region.\r\nWe grew industrial business sales in the Asia/Pacific region 15% in constant currency. We were particularly pleased with this performance, especially in China, given the marketplace challenges of major quick-service restaurants.\r\nAdjusted operating income for the industrial business was $31 million and comparable to the year-ago period. In constant currency, we grew adjusted operating income 5%, with the benefit of higher sales and cost savings more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of material costs and retirement benefit expense.\r\nLet's turn to Slide 24. Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, was $122 million, a 2% decline from $125 million in the first quarter of 2014. In constant currency, we grew adjusted operating income 1%.\r\nAs we projected, gross profit margin declined year-on-year. We indicated in our January call that the timing of material cost increases versus our pricing actions and cost savings would be a headwind this quarter. We also recognized that the impact of our pricing actions and cost savings would build in the upcoming quarters, and we still project a slight increase in gross profit margin for the fiscal year.\r\nAs a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expense declined 40 basis points, due in part to the higher sales and scale advantage over our cost bases.\r\nSpecial charges at $28 million have exceeded our initial guidance of $20 million, and we now estimate charges of $30 million for 2015. As Alan noted, we had a greater acceptance rate from our voluntary retirement program in North America and $4 million of charges from an action in EMEA.\r\nBelow the operating income line, the tax rate was 25% and below our guidance, due in part to discrete tax items recorded in the first quarter. This rate compared favorably to 31% in the first quarter of 2014, which included the impact of a higher tax rate in France that was subsequently reversed later in 2014. Based on our current outlook, we continue to expect a tax rate of 27% to 28% for 2015.\r\nIncome from unconsolidated operations rose 94% to $10 million this quarter, led by an excellent performance from our joint venture in Mexico, as Alan described. For the fiscal year, we continue to expect an increase of at least 10%, which reflects our caution on the impact of currency rates on this venture.\r\nAt the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2015 was $0.70. As you can see on Slide 27, this was an $0.08 year-on-year increase, led by the lower tax rate and increased income from our joint ventures.\r\nTurning next to Slide 28, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations this period was $96 million compared to $77 million in the first quarter of 2014. During the first quarter of 2015, we used $65 million of cash to repurchase nearly 1 million shares of McCormick stock. At quarter end, we had $51 million remaining on our $400 million authorization.\r\nEarly in March, we used $63 million in cash and debt to acquire Brand Aromatics. In addition, we expect to use cash and debt for the initial payment of approximately EUR 50 million when we close on the acquisition of Drogheria & Alimentari in mid-2015.\r\nAs we have done in the past, we expect to slow the pace of our share repurchase activity in order to return to our target debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA level of 1.5 to 1.8. Even at a slower pace, we still expect to lower our shares outstanding by 1% in 2015. Our balance sheet remains sound, we are generating strong cash flow and we believe we are well positioned to fund investments to drive growth, including future acquisitions.\r\nI'll wrap up with our latest 2015 financial outlook. We are reaffirming our expected 2015 growth rate in constant currency for sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. Since the time of our 2015 financial guidance, we have increased our estimated special charges and increased the projected unfavorable impact of currency rates. These are the primary changes to our initial guidance.\r\nWe anticipate further currency volatility in 2015 and, as necessary, will continue to update the impact on sales and profit. Because this is challenging to forecast, we rely on prevailing rates as the basis for our projections.\r\nWe continue to project a 4% to 6% sales increase in constant currency. The acquisitions we have announced should add about 1% of growth, and these sales, along with our first quarter results, give us more confidence in achieving the upper end of this range. We now believe currency rates will reduce our sales growth rate by 5 percentage points versus our initial guidance of 3 percentage points.\r\nWe expect to grow adjusted operating income 6% to 7% in constant currency from $608 million of adjusted operating income in 2014. While this is unchanged from our initial outlook, we have lowered our expected operating income on a reported basis to 0% to 2% from $603 million in 2014. This reflects an increased impact from unfavorable currency and an increase in special charges.\r\nWe expect adjusted earnings per share of $3.44 to $3.51. This includes the increased impact of currency and, therefore, is a reduction from our initial guidance. Excluding the impact of currency, we expect to grow adjusted earnings per share 6% to 8% from $3.37 in 2014. On a reported basis, we expect earnings per share of $3.28 to $3.35 compared to earnings per share of $3.34 in 2014. For fiscal year 2015, we expect another year of strong cash flow. This will provide funding for our dividend, our latest acquisitions and further share repurchase activity.\r\nLet's turn now to your questions, then some closing remarks from Alan. Operator, we're ready for the first question.",

This growth was led by France, as well as other smaller markets, and more than offsetting modest volume decline in the U.K. where we face a challenging retail environment.\r\nIn France, our brand marketing support and innovation drove increased sales both at core spices and seasonings, as well as homemade dessert products.\r\nIn constant currency, we grew consumer business sales in the Asia/Pacific region 10%, with a 13% increase in volume and product mix. This was led by sales in China, which rose 18%, mostly from higher volume and product mix. Constant-currency sales in Australia also rose this period, while sales in India declined due in part to lower prices in the market.\r\nIn total for the consumer business, adjusted operating income was $92 million compared to $94 million in the first quarter of 2014. In constant currency, adjusted operating income was comparable to the year-ago period, with the benefit of sales growth and cost savings offset by the unfavorable impact of material cost, retirement benefit expense and product mix. As we indicated in our January call, the increase in retirement benefit expense is mainly due to the noncash impact of a lower discount rate and new mortality table assumptions.\r\nOur brand marketing this period was up $1 million from the first quarter of 2014, and we also recorded $1 million in acquisition-related transaction cost for this business segment.\r\nTurning to our industrial business, we grew first quarter sales a robust 7% in constant currency from the year-ago period. Higher volume and product mix contributed 4 percentage points, and pricing actions taken in response to higher material costs added 3 percentage points.\r\nIn the Americas region, industrial business year-on-year sales rose 5% in constant currency, including the impact of pricing actions. We also grew volume and product mix. Throughout 2014, snack seasonings had been a source of strong growth, and this continues in 2015 with a strong pipeline of innovation. This performance, along with increased sales of branded food service products, more than offset continued weakness in sales to quick-service restaurant customers.\r\nIn our EMEA industrial business, we grew sales 9% in constant currency, with a 6% increase in volume and product mix. As Alan described, we are supporting the growth and geographic expansion of leading quick-service restaurants and food manufacturers in this region.\r\nWe grew industrial business sales in the Asia/Pacific region 15% in constant currency. We were particularly pleased with this performance, especially in China, given the marketplace challenges of major quick-service restaurants.\r\nAdjusted operating income for the industrial business was $31 million and comparable to the year-ago period. In constant currency, we grew adjusted operating income 5%, with the benefit of higher sales and cost savings more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of material costs and retirement benefit expense.\r\nLet's turn to Slide 24. Across both segments, adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges, was $122 million, a 2% decline from $125 million in the first quarter of 2014. In constant currency, we grew adjusted operating income 1%.\r\nAs we projected, gross profit margin declined year-on-year. We indicated in our January call that the timing of material cost increases versus our pricing actions and cost savings would be a headwind this quarter. We also recognized that the impact of our pricing actions and cost savings would build in the upcoming quarters, and we still project a slight increase in gross profit margin for the fiscal year.\r\nAs a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expense declined 40 basis points, due in part to the higher sales and scale advantage over our cost bases.\r\nSpecial charges at $28 million have exceeded our initial guidance of $20 million, and we now estimate charges of $30 million for 2015. As Alan noted, we had a greater acceptance rate from our voluntary retirement program in North America and $4 million of charges from an action in EMEA.\r\nBelow the operating income line, the tax rate was 25% and below our guidance, due in part to discrete tax items recorded in the first quarter. This rate compared favorably to 31% in the first quarter of 2014, which included the impact of a higher tax rate in France that was subsequently reversed later in 2014. Based on our current outlook, we continue to expect a tax rate of 27% to 28% for 2015.\r\nIncome from unconsolidated operations rose 94% to $10 million this quarter, led by an excellent performance from our joint venture in Mexico, as Alan described. For the fiscal year, we continue to expect an increase of at least 10%, which reflects our caution on the impact of currency rates on this venture.\r\nAt the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2015 was $0.70. As you can see on Slide 27, this was an $0.08 year-on-year increase, led by the lower tax rate and increased income from our joint ventures.\r\nTurning next to Slide 28, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations this period was $96 million compared to $77 million in the first quarter of 2014. During the first quarter of 2015, we used $65 million of cash to repurchase nearly 1 million shares of McCormick stock. At quarter end, we had $51 million remaining on our $400 million authorization.\r\nEarly in March, we used $63 million in cash and debt to acquire Brand Aromatics. In addition, we expect to use cash and debt for the initial payment of approximately EUR 50 million when we close on the acquisition of Drogheria & Alimentari in mid-2015.\r\nAs we have done in the past, we expect to slow the pace of our share repurchase activity in order to return to our target debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA level of 1.5 to 1.8. Even at a slower pace, we still expect to lower our shares outstanding by 1% in 2015. Our balance sheet remains sound, we are generating strong cash flow and we believe we are well positioned to fund investments to drive growth, including future acquisitions.\r\nI'll wrap up with our latest 2015 financial outlook. We are reaffirming our expected 2015 growth rate in constant currency for sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. Since the time of our 2015 financial guidance, we have increased our estimated special charges and increased the projected unfavorable impact of currency rates. These are the primary changes to our initial guidance.\r\nWe anticipate further currency volatility in 2015 and, as necessary, will continue to update the impact on sales and profit. Because this is challenging to forecast, we rely on prevailing rates as the basis for our projections.\r\nWe continue to project a 4% to 6% sales increase in constant currency. The acquisitions we have announced should add about 1% of growth, and these sales, along with our first quarter results, give us more confidence in achieving the upper end of this range. We now believe currency rates will reduce our sales growth rate by 5 percentage points versus our initial guidance of 3 percentage points.\r\nWe expect to grow adjusted operating income 6% to 7% in constant currency from $608 million of adjusted operating income in 2014. While this is unchanged from our initial outlook, we have lowered our expected operating income on a reported basis to 0% to 2% from $603 million in 2014. This reflects an increased impact from unfavorable currency and an increase in special charges.\r\nWe expect adjusted earnings per share of $3.44 to $3.51. This includes the increased impact of currency and, therefore, is a reduction from our initial guidance. Excluding the impact of currency, we expect to grow adjusted earnings per share 6% to 8% from $3.37 in 2014. On a reported basis, we expect earnings per share of $3.28 to $3.35 compared to earnings per share of $3.34 in 2014. For fiscal year 2015, we expect another year of strong cash flow. This will provide funding for our dividend, our latest acquisitions and further share repurchase activity.\r\nLet's turn now to your questions, then some closing remarks from Alan. Operator, we're ready for the first question.",
      "transcript_text3": "Can I come back to the U.S. consumer business? I remember last quarter, the negative mix effect of what was going on with this season at Wal-Mart was troublesome. And also the smaller brand encroachment that started probably a little over a year ago was a problem. It seems as though you might be coming through that a little bit better now. I just wanted to get the latest on what you're seeing on those trends.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Alexia. We are encouraged by the trends that we're seeing. We still have a lot of work to do. There's still a pretty fragmented category, and merchandising support for a number of brands continues. But we're encouraged by the progress that we're seeing.\n\n---\n\nAnd then on the -- so on both sides, on the small brands and the control brand as well?\n\n---\n\nYes. We feel like our stories are gaining some traction, but we know it's going to be a fair bit of time to really see all that come through.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just switching to China. I seem to remember that you were talking about how you were tapping into -- this is in the industrial business. You were tapping into local restaurant chains as an avenue for growth because some of the big American restaurant chains were having so much trouble. Where are you on that? And do you see sort of fairly sustainable growth in that area from here?\n\n---\n\nI'm going to ask Lawrence to take that one.\n\n---\n\nAlexia, we are continuing to make progress with the local Chinese customers. But I will say that in the -- this quarter, the biggest part of our performance has been new product wins, export from China and progress and the recovery of the Western quick-service restaurants, which are beginning to see foot traffic improve.\n\n---\n\nSo 2 questions, if I could. One of your comments, I think, Gordon, were in relation to product mix seemed like it was pretty positive across the business. If I heard correctly, for the consumer division, I believe you said mix was a negative for profit. I just wanted to ensure I heard that properly and wanted to understand the dynamic there, if I could, please, on the consumer division, in particular.\n\n---\n\nYes. For on a total -- I'll start with total company. On a total company basis, product mix was neutral to our results. The gross margin impact was driven, as I said, by the increased raw material cost and the timing of our savings programs coming in and our pricing actions. On the consumer division, the raw material cost increase was still the primary story, although there was a slight negative product mix as well within consumer. But this -- again, the bigger story on the quarter for both segments was the raw material cost increases.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then also, just a question, if I could, on the U.S. consumer side. And, Alan, you're discussing the gourmet relaunch and how that's progressing that it's allowing you to -- I don't know, say it this way, but to box out some of the smaller competitors and try and have a better sell-in story for the retailers. I guess I want to understand, are you still seeing competition at the lower end of the category? And how is gourmet helping to sort of address that challenge for the business?\n\n---\n\nYes. We're still seeing competition at the value segment as well. What -- and as we segment consumers, there is a gourmet consumer who really cares about the products that they put in their food and understand the difference in origins and spices, and so that's what we're targeting with the gourmet consumer. So it's not necessarily helping on the value end. The work that we're doing at retail on price thresholds and absolute price points are where we're combating the value side.\n\n---\n\nAnd I guess just to follow on that theme. Competition from some of the smaller competitors, that's mostly been on the value side, less so on the premium or gourmet side, is that correct?\n\n---\n\nNo, we've seen a fair bit of competition on the premium side as well.\n\n---\n\nAlan, I wanted to dig in a little bit into domestic pricing for consumer. If we look at Nielsen data, your price per unit at the retail level has been slipping, but it's the opposite at the wholesale level. You've talked about your efforts to convince retailers to sort of get their on-shelf prices right. And I'll admit, I was skeptical that this could be done without, I guess, wholesale prices dropping first, but it seems to be happening. So can you talk a little bit about, first, is that accurate? And second, what's really making that dynamic, which isn't easy to pull off, successful?\n\n---\n\nWell, we're still seeing the dynamic with the mix because of some value products that we continue to supply, and we expect that that's going to continue. But what we are doing is showing a category profitability story on key items that -- where prices are pretty sensitive and working with the customers on getting those prices right. It is a kind of a store-by-store and a customer-by-customer negotiation, but we have a very compelling category story, which is what we're out selling.\n\n---\n\nBut isn't the implication then that the retailers are giving up some margin, which is never an easy thing to get them to do?\n\n---\n\nWell, in some cases, it's making sure that they have the prices right to compete in their marketplace because there are -- their competition with other retailers has them a little bit out of whack, and so that's part of the story. The other is just reapplying some of the trade funds that we already have and getting them to the products that are more price sensitive.\n\n---\n\nOkay. If I could ask a quick follow-up. Consumer America's organic sales, significantly better than what Nielsen would have suggested. I appreciate Nielsen doesn't capture everything. But just as we think about modeling 2Q and beyond, any retail sell-ins of any new product in 1Q or anything we should be aware of that might be sort of considered a nonrecurring event?\n\n---\n\nI wouldn't expect any nonrecurring event that is going to move the dial significantly. But remember, what you're seeing in Nielsen and we have -- I know that the investment community has a real focus on spices and seasonings, we're growing share and growing the recipe mix category. That is certainly a help. We've got a number of channels that aren't necessarily captured there. So while we want to see the Nielsen and the IRI data in spices and seasonings improve, and we have seen some of that sequentially, we -- it doesn't capture the whole picture.\n\n---\n\nThis is Cornell Burnette in with a question for David. So going back to U.S. consumer, the operating margins were down 50 basis points in the quarter, following F '14 in which they were down 70 basis points, and we saw market shares in spices down about 80 basis points in the quarter. So when we go forward, what do we need in order to get margins going in the right direction? Is it a matter of seeing stabilized market share trends within that spices segment?\n\n---\n\nIt's a couple of things. One is our cost-reduction activities are going to start to take hold and impact through the year as we offset the increased cost. We get the increased cost early in the year, and it takes a while for our cost-reduction activities to impact it. So that's one. Secondly, as we stabilize and start to grow share in our higher-margin items and in spices and seasonings, we should start to see a recovery in gross margin. Gordon, do you want to add anything to that? Or Lawrence?\n\n---\n\nNo, those are the 2 key items. Obviously, this year, as we've mentioned, is a story of raw material price -- or cost increases, so the cost reductions are going to be meaningful as we progress through the year. And as you've seen us talk earlier, that we've stepped up our game in that respect, so therefore, they're going to have a bigger impact as we progress. And obviously, volume growth is key to leveraging our scale. And that is a good start to the year, as you saw in our results. And we would need to continue that momentum.\n\n---\n\nI think I would echo that, Gordon. The -- we've been very clear that the cost impact of the higher raw materials impact us immediately from the beginning of the year. But the cost-reduction activity, the cost-improvement activity that we're highly confident in, phases in as we go through the year. I'll also emphasize that there is -- that we took no list price decreases or conducted any extraordinary promotions in this quarter. The change in the margin structure is strictly related to the impact of cost and a minor contribution from product mix.\n\n---\n\nAnd then looking at EMEA consumer business, noticeably, no pricing in the quarter, but significant headwinds from foreign currency. And it looks like you're expecting good acceleration in pricing in EMEA going forward. Just was wondering, what type of risk do you think that will have to volumes in that EMEA consumer segment, given that your cost position may be a little bit unfavorable to local competitors, given that you're dealing with higher raw material costs and FX at the same time?\n\n---\n\nYes, the local competitors are going to have the same issue because spices and seasonings are mostly priced in U.S. dollar. So part of what you'll see is a pricing change to reflect the impact of raw materials on currency. We feel pretty good about our ability to execute in the U.K. -- or I'm sorry, in EMEA.\n\n---\n\nI just have a pretty simple maintenance question. So I just want to clarify, I think -- I thought you said -- or I know this morning, you stated that, I guess, constant-currency EPS growth didn't change, and that's 6% to 8%. Then I thought, maybe I just -- I'm just reading this, but I thought at the time of Q4, at least in the transcript on what you said on the call, was that constant-currency EPS, excluding the special charges, was supposed to be 7% to 9%. So I just want to make sure there wasn't a change to constant-currency EPS. And if there is a change, what's driving that?\n\n---\n\nYes, there is no change. In the fourth quarter call, we also highlighted pension as another impact that got us to that 7% to 9%. So excluding -- in constant currency and excluding the impact of the increased benefit cost, EPS growth is -- was 7% to 9% and still is 7% to 9%.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then I just have a quick follow-up. Then I guess the same rationale applies to adjusted operating income, which was constant -- sorry, which was 4% to 5%, including FX, but that was off the $608 million. And now if we're just including an additional point of FX, I'm assuming that that's just, very simplistically, we're now just at 3% to 4% off of the $608 million?\n\n---\n\nYes, this is Joyce. That's right. In our initial guidance of 4% to 5% growth in adjusted operating income, that had about 2 percentage points of currency implied in there. So the constant-currency growth rate was 6% to 7%, which it continues to be.\n\n---\n\nIf I go back to what I was kind of concerned about 3 months ago, it was my thought that McCormick would have to, or was going to reduce sizes on certain SKUs and maintain list prices. So it was kind of like a wait-out strategy in response to higher commodities. And McCormick was doing it at a time when competition was intensifying and price gaps seemed to be getting bigger with private label. So can you just give us kind of an update on that, on where you are in that process? And has competition followed? Or do you feel like your price gaps are getting bigger on any items as a result of this?\n\n---\n\nObviously, because of the fragmented competition that we have, it's a mixed story. But our larger competitors have announced price increases as we've gone into the year, both in the -- on the industrial and the consumer side, because they're seeing the same level of commodity cost increases that we are.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And just also a follow-up. You said quick-service restaurants in the U.S., kind of weak. I would have thought by now that there'd be some kind of a pickup here, that maybe it's just an industry thing. So can you give us a reason why, is it 1 or 2 retailers? Or is it all retailers where you're seeing that weakness in the environment?\n\n---\n\nOur quick-service business in the Americas is pretty broad to a number of customers, but there are a couple of customers that are large enough to have an impact. And those larger customers, as they've reported, have been struggling somewhat with foot traffic and sales, and that impacts us as well. We are gaining with some of the smaller quick-service restaurants, and we feel pretty good about that. But it's not enough to offset the very large chains that are well-publicized in the -- with their challenges.\n\n---\n\nOne specific question, Alan. On the cost-cutting, I guess, there are now 2 initiatives to lower SG&A as a percentage of sales. Not to be too, I guess, specific, but when you say fiscal '16, do you mean by the end of fiscal '16 that, that 100 basis point improvement should occur or at the -- kind of at the start?\n\n---\n\nWe expect it to be in our guidance for -- as in not giving early guidance, but we expect that to be a full year impact for 2016 because the costs that we're taking out are coming out now.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So kind of on a -- like on a run-rate basis, but building over this year as well?\n\n---\n\nThat's right.\n\n---\n\nThat's correct.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then on -- I guess you -- right, you just opened up the spigot for M&A, you've done 2 deals. I mean, and I think you were quite frank last quarter about saying that the pipeline looked pretty good and you're kind of reiterating that. So I mean maybe you could go a little bit more into the deals that you're seeing, why is there kind of a pickup in that today?\n\n---\n\nWell, there's the benefit right now of the low-interest rate environment, so that is -- and I'm assuming that some sellers are anticipating that's going to change in the not-too-distant future. So it's an optimum time. If you've got a business that's got good traction that maybe needs -- and as we've seen with the businesses we've been able to buy that need a little investment for growth, because there's growth opportunities, now is a pretty good time. They're probably also looking and seeing, as we have, that multiples are attractive for a seller, a little more challenging for a buyer. But as we've always done, we've been pretty financially disciplined to make sure we get the returns that we expect. But it's a pretty robust environment for the kinds of deals that we like to do right now.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then my last question is during the, I guess, the -- you seem to be coming out of it, but during the depths of the U.S. consumer segment pressure, you not only noted the competition in spice and seasonings, but you also mentioned slower growth or missteps in some of the other products, whether it was Grill Mates or marinades, spice and rice and Zatarain's, et cetera. So I guess, one, kind of would you -- to the -- to those other businesses, are they seeing some better traction in the market? And do you see, like adding through M&A, other kind of niches, which has been very successful for the company in the past, but we haven't seen much of late?\n\n---\n\nYes, we do see adding more adjacencies in our businesses, both in consumer and industrial. And so we see there's opportunities. And we're a little mixed on the smaller brands at least in the quarter. So we had good traction in some of those smaller brands and some that still have some level of challenge. I will say that as we talked about Grill Mates, we are aggressively pursuing an earlier grilling season this year, and we feel like we're getting the kind of traction that we expect. Last year, grilling -- our grilling promotion started closer to Memorial Day. We're getting them out a lot earlier this year.\n\n---\n\nThis is actually Lubi on for Akshay. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the marketing around your new product launches slated for the remainder of the year. And maybe if you could just touch on sort of the rollout plan and in-store merchandising, et cetera, for those new products? And then I have a follow-up.\n\n---\n\nI'll let Lawrence take that one.\n\n---\n\nSure. Thank you, Alan. Well, as is always the case, we have a fairly robust launch of new products. Most of them are in our core category, so they get the benefit of all of our branded advertising. And in turn, the work that we do on them supports the growth of our core business as well. We are really quite encouraged by the launch of Skillet Sauces that we introduced last year and that we -- where we've continued the introduction this year. We had advertising for those products in the first quarter. And we have new grilling products and new gluten-free products that we've launched this year that we're also quite excited about.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then just on the income from unconsolidated operations line, it came in quite a bit better than we were expecting, and we were modeling pretty decent growth there. But can you just talk a little bit about what's driving the results there? And also, do you expect to see sort of the same level of growth for the remainder of the year that we saw here in the 1Q?\n\n---\n\nThis is Gordon. It's -- as we've mentioned in the call, it's driven by great performance from our joint venture in Mexico. They -- so we've talked in previous calls, there's a new facility that has been ramping up and improving productivity. The sales growth there in the market has been strong, and they've been very good in managing their cost position. So all of that has contributed to some very, very strong growth in the first quarter. We don't expect that pace of growth as we continue through the rest of the year, and the reason for that is the impact of currency on a go-forward basis on that business. So we do expect moderating growth in that area, especially as we get towards the back half of the year, where their performance was also very strong and we start to lap that.\n\n---\n\nI want to thank you for your questions and for participating in today's call. Consumer demand for flavor is increasing and our categories have strong growth rates. Our geographic presence and product portfolio are expanding and ideally aligned with the move towards healthier eating, fresh ingredients, ethnic cuisine and bold taste. And we're driving growth through innovation, brand marketing and acquisitions.\r\nIn 2015, we stepped up our cost-reduction activity, and we'll continue to pursue ways to improve our productivity and profit as we continue to grow. We look forward to reporting to you on our continued progress in the upcoming quarters.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Alan, and I'd also like to thank those who joined us this morning. If anyone has additional questions regarding today's information, you can reach us at (410) 771-7244. That concludes this morning's conference.",

And second, what's really making that dynamic, which isn't easy to pull off, successful?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nWell, we're still seeing the dynamic with the mix because of some value products that we continue to supply, and we expect that that's going to continue. But what we are doing is showing a category profitability story on key items that -- where prices are pretty sensitive and working with the customers on getting those prices right. It is a kind of a store-by-store and a customer-by-customer negotiation, but we have a very compelling category story, which is what we're out selling.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenneth Goldman (Analysts)】\nBut isn't the implication then that the retailers are giving up some margin, which is never an easy thing to get them to do?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nWell, in some cases, it's making sure that they have the prices right to compete in their marketplace because there are -- their competition with other retailers has them a little bit out of whack, and so that's part of the story. The other is just reapplying some of the trade funds that we already have and getting them to the products that are more price sensitive.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kenneth Goldman (Analysts)】\nOkay. If I could ask a quick follow-up. Consumer America's organic sales, significantly better than what Nielsen would have suggested. I appreciate Nielsen doesn't capture everything. But just as we think about modeling 2Q and beyond, any retail sell-ins of any new product in 1Q or anything we should be aware of that might be sort of considered a nonrecurring event?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nI wouldn't expect any nonrecurring event that is going to move the dial significantly. But remember, what you're seeing in Nielsen and we have -- I know that the investment community has a real focus on spices and seasonings, we're growing share and growing the recipe mix category. That is certainly a help. We've got a number of channels that aren't necessarily captured there. So while we want to see the Nielsen and the IRI data in spices and seasonings improve, and we have seen some of that sequentially, we -- it doesn't capture the whole picture.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Cornell Burnette (Analysts)】\nThis is Cornell Burnette in with a question for David. So going back to U.S. consumer, the operating margins were down 50 basis points in the quarter, following F '14 in which they were down 70 basis points, and we saw market shares in spices down about 80 basis points in the quarter. So when we go forward, what do we need in order to get margins going in the right direction? Is it a matter of seeing stabilized market share trends within that spices segment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nIt's a couple of things. One is our cost-reduction activities are going to start to take hold and impact through the year as we offset the increased cost. We get the increased cost early in the year, and it takes a while for our cost-reduction activities to impact it. So that's one. Secondly, as we stabilize and start to grow share in our higher-margin items and in spices and seasonings, we should start to see a recovery in gross margin. Gordon, do you want to add anything to that? Or Lawrence?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gordon Stetz (Executives)】\nNo, those are the 2 key items. Obviously, this year, as we've mentioned, is a story of raw material price -- or cost increases, so the cost reductions are going to be meaningful as we progress through the year. And as you've seen us talk earlier, that we've stepped up our game in that respect, so therefore, they're going to have a bigger impact as we progress. And obviously, volume growth is key to leveraging our scale. And that is a good start to the year, as you saw in our results. And we would need to continue that momentum.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Kurzius (Executives)】\nI think I would echo that, Gordon. The -- we've been very clear that the cost impact of the higher raw materials impact us immediately from the beginning of the year. But the cost-reduction activity, the cost-improvement activity that we're highly confident in, phases in as we go through the year. I'll also emphasize that there is -- that we took no list price decreases or conducted any extraordinary promotions in this quarter. The change in the margin structure is strictly related to the impact of cost and a minor contribution from product mix.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Cornell Burnette (Analysts)】\nAnd then looking at EMEA consumer business, noticeably, no pricing in the quarter, but significant headwinds from foreign currency. And it looks like you're expecting good acceleration in pricing in EMEA going forward. Just was wondering, what type of risk do you think that will have to volumes in that EMEA consumer segment, given that your cost position may be a little bit unfavorable to local competitors, given that you're dealing with higher raw material costs and FX at the same time?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nYes, the local competitors are going to have the same issue because spices and seasonings are mostly priced in U.S. dollar. So part of what you'll see is a pricing change to reflect the impact of raw materials on currency. We feel pretty good about our ability to execute in the U.K. -- or I'm sorry, in EMEA.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Dickerson (Analysts)】\nI just have a pretty simple maintenance question. So I just want to clarify, I think -- I thought you said -- or I know this morning, you stated that, I guess, constant-currency EPS growth didn't change, and that's 6% to 8%. Then I thought, maybe I just -- I'm just reading this, but I thought at the time of Q4, at least in the transcript on what you said on the call, was that constant-currency EPS, excluding the special charges, was supposed to be 7% to 9%. So I just want to make sure there wasn't a change to constant-currency EPS. And if there is a change, what's driving that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gordon Stetz (Executives)】\nYes, there is no change. In the fourth quarter call, we also highlighted pension as another impact that got us to that 7% to 9%. So excluding -- in constant currency and excluding the impact of the increased benefit cost, EPS growth is -- was 7% to 9% and still is 7% to 9%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Dickerson (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then I just have a quick follow-up. Then I guess the same rationale applies to adjusted operating income, which was constant -- sorry, which was 4% to 5%, including FX, but that was off the $608 million. And now if we're just including an additional point of FX, I'm assuming that that's just, very simplistically, we're now just at 3% to 4% off of the $608 million?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Joyce Brooks (Executives)】\nYes, this is Joyce. That's right. In our initial guidance of 4% to 5% growth in adjusted operating income, that had about 2 percentage points of currency implied in there. So the constant-currency growth rate was 6% to 7%, which it continues to be.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Moskow (Analysts)】\nIf I go back to what I was kind of concerned about 3 months ago, it was my thought that McCormick would have to, or was going to reduce sizes on certain SKUs and maintain list prices. So it was kind of like a wait-out strategy in response to higher commodities. And McCormick was doing it at a time when competition was intensifying and price gaps seemed to be getting bigger with private label. So can you just give us kind of an update on that, on where you are in that process? And has competition followed? Or do you feel like your price gaps are getting bigger on any items as a result of this?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nObviously, because of the fragmented competition that we have, it's a mixed story. But our larger competitors have announced price increases as we've gone into the year, both in the -- on the industrial and the consumer side, because they're seeing the same level of commodity cost increases that we are.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Moskow (Analysts)】\nGot it. And just also a follow-up. You said quick-service restaurants in the U.S., kind of weak. I would have thought by now that there'd be some kind of a pickup here, that maybe it's just an industry thing. So can you give us a reason why, is it 1 or 2 retailers? Or is it all retailers where you're seeing that weakness in the environment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nOur quick-service business in the Americas is pretty broad to a number of customers, but there are a couple of customers that are large enough to have an impact. And those larger customers, as they've reported, have been struggling somewhat with foot traffic and sales, and that impacts us as well. We are gaining with some of the smaller quick-service restaurants, and we feel pretty good about that. But it's not enough to offset the very large chains that are well-publicized in the -- with their challenges.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Katzman (Analysts)】\nOne specific question, Alan. On the cost-cutting, I guess, there are now 2 initiatives to lower SG&A as a percentage of sales. Not to be too, I guess, specific, but when you say fiscal '16, do you mean by the end of fiscal '16 that, that 100 basis point improvement should occur or at the -- kind of at the start?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nWe expect it to be in our guidance for -- as in not giving early guidance, but we expect that to be a full year impact for 2016 because the costs that we're taking out are coming out now.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Katzman (Analysts)】\nOkay. So kind of on a -- like on a run-rate basis, but building over this year as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nThat's right.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gordon Stetz (Executives)】\nThat's correct.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Katzman (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then on -- I guess you -- right, you just opened up the spigot for M&A, you've done 2 deals. I mean, and I think you were quite frank last quarter about saying that the pipeline looked pretty good and you're kind of reiterating that. So I mean maybe you could go a little bit more into the deals that you're seeing, why is there kind of a pickup in that today?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nWell, there's the benefit right now of the low-interest rate environment, so that is -- and I'm assuming that some sellers are anticipating that's going to change in the not-too-distant future. So it's an optimum time. If you've got a business that's got good traction that maybe needs -- and as we've seen with the businesses we've been able to buy that need a little investment for growth, because there's growth opportunities, now is a pretty good time. They're probably also looking and seeing, as we have, that multiples are attractive for a seller, a little more challenging for a buyer. But as we've always done, we've been pretty financially disciplined to make sure we get the returns that we expect. But it's a pretty robust environment for the kinds of deals that we like to do right now.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Katzman (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then my last question is during the, I guess, the -- you seem to be coming out of it, but during the depths of the U.S. consumer segment pressure, you not only noted the competition in spice and seasonings, but you also mentioned slower growth or missteps in some of the other products, whether it was Grill Mates or marinades, spice and rice and Zatarain's, et cetera. So I guess, one, kind of would you -- to the -- to those other businesses, are they seeing some better traction in the market? And do you see, like adding through M&A, other kind of niches, which has been very successful for the company in the past, but we haven't seen much of late?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nYes, we do see adding more adjacencies in our businesses, both in consumer and industrial. And so we see there's opportunities. And we're a little mixed on the smaller brands at least in the quarter. So we had good traction in some of those smaller brands and some that still have some level of challenge. I will say that as we talked about Grill Mates, we are aggressively pursuing an earlier grilling season this year, and we feel like we're getting the kind of traction that we expect. Last year, grilling -- our grilling promotion started closer to Memorial Day. We're getting them out a lot earlier this year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lubi Kutua (Analysts)】\nThis is actually Lubi on for Akshay. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the marketing around your new product launches slated for the remainder of the year. And maybe if you could just touch on sort of the rollout plan and in-store merchandising, et cetera, for those new products? And then I have a follow-up.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nI'll let Lawrence take that one.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Kurzius (Executives)】\nSure. Thank you, Alan. Well, as is always the case, we have a fairly robust launch of new products. Most of them are in our core category, so they get the benefit of all of our branded advertising. And in turn, the work that we do on them supports the growth of our core business as well. We are really quite encouraged by the launch of Skillet Sauces that we introduced last year and that we -- where we've continued the introduction this year. We had advertising for those products in the first quarter. And we have new grilling products and new gluten-free products that we've launched this year that we're also quite excited about.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lubi Kutua (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then just on the income from unconsolidated operations line, it came in quite a bit better than we were expecting, and we were modeling pretty decent growth there. But can you just talk a little bit about what's driving the results there? And also, do you expect to see sort of the same level of growth for the remainder of the year that we saw here in the 1Q?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gordon Stetz (Executives)】\nThis is Gordon. It's -- as we've mentioned in the call, it's driven by great performance from our joint venture in Mexico. They -- so we've talked in previous calls, there's a new facility that has been ramping up and improving productivity. The sales growth there in the market has been strong, and they've been very good in managing their cost position. So all of that has contributed to some very, very strong growth in the first quarter. We don't expect that pace of growth as we continue through the rest of the year, and the reason for that is the impact of currency on a go-forward basis on that business. So we do expect moderating growth in that area, especially as we get towards the back half of the year, where their performance was also very strong and we start to lap that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Alan Wilson (Executives)】\nI want to thank you for your questions and for participating in today's call. Consumer demand for flavor is increasing and our categories have strong growth rates. Our geographic presence and product portfolio are expanding and ideally aligned with the move towards healthier eating, fresh ingredients, ethnic cuisine and bold taste. And we're driving growth through innovation, brand marketing and acquisitions.\r\nIn 2015, we stepped up our cost-reduction activity, and we'll continue to pursue ways to improve our productivity and profit as we continue to grow. We look forward to reporting to you on our continued progress in the upcoming quarters.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Joyce Brooks (Executives)】\nThanks, Alan, and I'd also like to thank those who joined us this morning. If anyone has additional questions regarding today's information, you can reach us at (410) 771-7244. That concludes this morning's conference.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's fiscal 2015 third quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, or at our website, investors.nike.com.\r\nJoining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker; followed by Trevor Edwards, President of the NIKE Brand; and finally, you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you for your cooperation on this.\r\nI'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone. Well, we delivered another strong quarter in Q3. Revenues grew 7% to $7.5 billion; gross margin increased by 140 basis points to 45.9%; and diluted earnings per share increased 19% to $0.89.\r\nWe were able to deliver results like these for the quarter by leveraging the power of the NIKE portfolio. Over the last 3 months, the macro environment has become increasingly volatile. Foreign currency headwinds have intensified, product input costs continued to fluctuate and the political landscape is evolving in many countries around the world. This is the environment in which all multinational companies now operate, and NIKE is not immune to it.\r\nThe difference for NIKE, however, is that we see this as an opportunity to create further separation in the marketplace. Our globally diverse portfolio of geographies, categories, brands, product types and distribution channels gives us a distinct competitive advantage. By going deep into the business, we are able to see opportunities to serve the consumer and drive growth despite the choppier landscape. This surgical approach to finding new dimensions of growth ensures we capture the full potential of our brands around the world. And that includes driving strong growth in the areas of our business that are already well established such as Western Europe, China, North America in footwear as well as businesses such as women's, young athletes, apparel and e-commerce where we are accelerating development. These are just a few examples of the dimensions of our business where we are continuing to identify further opportunities to expand our reach and drive growth.\r\nAnd we do this while maintaining a disciplined approach to investing in those opportunities with the highest potential for return so we can drive growth and manage risk over the short and the long term. This complete offense is how we can continue to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. As you have seen from NIKE in the past, we know how to operate in a challenging environment better than anyone, and you will continue to see us leverage the breadth and depth of our global portfolio to do just that going forward.\r\nAt NIKE, everything we do starts with the consumer. It's our obsession with serving the consumer that sharpens our focus and drives our growth. The expectations of our consumers are evolving rapidly, and we're able to meet and often exceed those expectations because we know the athlete. By working with athletes at all levels, from the elite to the everyday, we have a level of knowledge and insight that is unmatched in our industry. And we are able to use the insights that we gain to create new product and services that drive new levels of performance innovation across all of our categories.\r\nThe pace of innovation at NIKE has never been faster, and our pipeline has never been more robust. We're leveraging new tools and processes to unlock significant advancements every day. However, the starting point for innovation remains the same, and that's the athlete. Many of our greatest innovations have come from going deep into an individual sport to solve a unique athletic need. And let me highlight a few examples in our footwear business from Q3.\r\nIn Running, the LunarTempo is a shoe that merges speed with cushioning for a great ride over the longer runs; and then the newly redesigned Air Max 2015, our most flexible, comfortable Air Max to date. We're seeing very strong response from consumers, and I'm tremendously excited about the pipeline of products in the Running category.\r\nIn Basketball, with his 10th signature shoe, Kobe Bryant returned to a low top and once again pushed the limits of design. In addition to great consumer reaction to the KOBE X, players around the NBA are wearing it for its great traction and cushioning.\r\nAnd in Football, the Nike Vapor Untouchable cleat was created to provide the game's fastest players with power and precision on the field. We've had tremendous feedback on the performance and the look of the Untouchable from the athletes at both the NFL and the collegiate level.\r\nAnd in Men's Training, the Nike MetCon 1, a first of its kind high-intensity training shoe that has been incredibly popular in the marketplace, and it's just a hint at what's to come in Men's Training.\r\nThese innovations each deliver a new level of performance for the athlete. However, we only truly realize our potential as a company when we continue to leverage those breakthroughs across multiple sports and categories. It's what you've seen from us time and time again. Many of our biggest footwear platforms such as Lunar and Free, Flyknit and Nike Air were initially created to solve a specific athlete need in a specific category. But now they serve as the foundation for our greatest products across multiple categories.\r\nSimilarly, in apparel, platforms such as Aeroloft and Dri-FIT, both originally introduced in Running, set the standard for thermoregulation and moisture management in multiple categories and product classifications. And our Nike Pro collection continues to drive energy in all sports, especially our Pro Bra and Tight collections for women.\r\nIndividually and collectively, our product innovation is breaking new ground across all of our categories. And as excited as we are about the technical details of these products, what's most important is how well our products are resonating with athletes and consumers, which we clearly saw in the quarter.\r\nInnovation fuels more than product at NIKE. It also drives how we do business and how we connect with the world. In the case of our digital ecosystem, NIKE is growing a connected community of athletes all over the world. This community is seamlessly engaged with the brand not only by accepting the world's best product, but by fueling activity and improving their athletic lives. We know it's not enough to simply to interact. True connections require depth and richness. And in Q3, we strengthened these digital connections and added new dimensions to our digital ecosystem.\r\nSo how does NIKE continue to expand our digital innovation?  Well, we linked experience to commerce. We released the Nike SNKRS app during the NBA All-Star Game in New York, letting consumers on mobile devices see, share and buy our most coveted footwear products. And we broadened access. We announced several partnerships with the Nike+ Running app to let runners connect to Nike+ experiences to even more of their devices and fitness equipment. And we glow -- we grow our global reach. We added more sharing capabilities to our Nike+ Training Club app. We expanded it to 18 languages. It's work like this that will continue to power our digital experiences for years to come.\r\nAt the same time, in Q3, we continued to see tremendous growth in our e-commerce business as NIKE.com was up 42% in the quarter. Traffic and conversion both increased. And for the first time in our history, mobile traffic exceeded desktop traffic, helped in part by the introduction of our SNKRS app. And going forward, we will continue to invest in this area to best serve our consumer. \r\nAdditionally, we'll continue to drive growth in our e-commerce business by increasing consumer access to product customization. In Q3, for example, we brought exclusive new Flyknit options to NIKEiD, giving consumers the ability to take customization to yet another level. Overall, we continue to see tremendous potential for growth in our e-commerce business as we leverage our digital platform to continue to deliver premium products, services and experiences for our consumers.\r\nAs we head into the final quarter of fiscal 2015 and beyond, I continue to see tremendous opportunity for NIKE around the world. You've heard me say many times that I see more potential for growth going forward than at any time in our history, and I certainly continue to believe that today.\r\nWhile the current macro environment is challenging, it is not new to us. We have a highly experienced and aligned management team that knows how to continue to deliver profitable growth by turning challenges into opportunities. It's what we've always done in the past, and it's what you can expect from us going forward.\r\nThanks. And now here's Trevor.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Mark. Q3 is a great example about how the strength of the NIKE Brand drives growth around the world, even in a more challenging macro environment. As Mark mentioned, the impact of foreign exchange has intensified, and Don will talk more about our work to mitigate those impacts. As I normally do, I'll speak to our results on a constant-currency basis. While we consider the impact of foreign exchange as part of the overall management of our business, currency-neutral results provide a clearer view of the underlying operational performance.\r\nSo let's take a look at the numbers. The NIKE Brand revenue grew 11% with strong growth in Western Europe, Greater China and the emerging markets, as well as in our Sportswear and Basketball categories. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 29%, driven by all concepts in all geographies. And as Mark mentioned, we also saw continued strong growth in NIKE.com. And global futures are up 11%, reflecting the strong growth despite comparisons to the prior year, which included strong World Cup demand. Excluding the impact of the World Cup, we estimate future orders would have grown in the mid-teens.\r\nAs Q3 growth -- our Q3 growth is a result of the deep relationships we've built with consumers through the category offense. Our laser focus on individual consumers strengthens our -- those connections, whether they are online, at retail or at live experiences. NIKE's consistent focus on serving the consumer through the lens of their chosen sports helps enable continued profitable growth.\r\nWhat's more, only NIKE has the global scale to execute this consumer-focused strategy in markets around the world. As we further drive the category offense globally, we continue to prove our ability to connect our brands to consumers and build compelling retail destinations that elevate, segment and differentiate the markets around the globe.\r\nTo see the category offense in action, let's first take a look at 2 of our key categories: Basketball and Running. Both NIKE and the Jordan Brand continue to deliver the absolute best in Basketball, with innovative products and groundbreaking experiences. Q3 was the 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for the Basketball category. And as the game expands around the globe, we continue to see amazing opportunity for growth in this important category. Q3 was a great example of the combined power of Nike Basketball and Brand Jordan to create excitement and energy in the marketplace. I was in New York City for the NBA All-Star weekend, and it was clearly an electric experience for hundreds and thousands of basketball fans who took part. All over the city, NIKE and Brand Jordan executed retail concepts and consumer experiences that showcase basketball's unique culture and passion.\r\nNike Basketball invited fans to visit the Zoom City Arena, offering them a chance to play on the first digital LED court in the United States. Brand Jordan transformed the Penn Pavilion into an interactive consumer experience where fans could relive Michael Jordan's iconic game-winning shots. And both brands created elevated retail executions at NIKETOWN at House of Hoops locations with Foot Locker and at pop-up locations around the city. All of this combined to deliver a truly one-of-a-kind experience for our consumers, something only NIKE can do.\r\nIn addition to delivering highly engaging consumer experiences, we continued to lead with innovative product. In the quarter, Kyrie Irving, one of the most exciting young players in the game today, became the newest signature athlete for NIKE with the launch of the KYRIE 1. Offering superior traction with the Hyperfuse construction, the KYRIE 1 is an excellent example of how we never stop improving. Also, seeing huge consumer response was the KOBE X, the most coveted shoe yet for the popular KOBE line.\r\nNext, let's talk about Running. As you know, Running is our heritage and our largest performance category. The NIKE Brand continues to resonate with runners, fueled by the Nike+ Run Club and grassroots running events around the world. And the Running category continues to deliver strong results in key geographies, including Europe, China and the emerging markets. That said, core footwear within the Running category isn't performing as well as we would like, particularly in North America. As a result, we are highly focused on delivering new innovation into our core product offerings to ensure we continue to serve our consumer with the absolute best.\r\nWith our premium performance products, we continue to see strong sell-through for footwear styles like the Air Max 2015, the LunarTempo and the Air Zoom Pegasus 31. In addition, our premium performance apparel continues to drive growth, and we saw strong consumer response to the styles such as the new Epic Lux and the Epic Run Tights.\r\nAs part of our Amplify strategy, we leverage the heritage of our Running into Sportswear to deliver great style for consumers who appreciate the aesthetic of running. This is our complete offense in the Running category. And Running-inspired Sportswear performed exceedingly well in the quarter, led by strong consumer response to the Roshe platform and the Roshe Flyknit in particular. The Air Max 1 Collection also had strong performance in the quarter.\r\nLooking ahead, we will continue to build on what's working in Running as we further strengthen our business to accelerate growth. We are excited to have a robust, continuous pipeline of groundbreaking footwear innovations, which we will bring to the market over the next 18 months. And we will also leverage the momentum in platforms such as the Lunar, Flyknit and our Air Max to continue to drive growth. Overall, Running continues to be a tremendous source of innovation and inspiration for NIKE and one of our key long-term growth drivers.\r\nLet's talk about a few of our key geographies. First, North America, which delivered 6% revenue growth in the quarter. Consumer demand continues to be very strong in North America as most key categories grew and futures were up 15%. That said, revenue growth was somewhat lower than expected in the quarter due to challenges related to the port congestion on the West Coast, which escalated late in our fiscal quarter 3. As a result, some shipments originally expected for delivery in Q3 were delayed. Looking ahead, we expect revenue growth in quarter 4 to accelerate as the flow of product through the supply chain begins to normalize. However, we do expect it will take a few quarters to return to fully normalized product flow as there are a significant number of containers to be cleared from the ports on the West Coast.\r\nTo be very clear, there continues to be tremendous momentum for the NIKE Brand in North America, thanks to innovative product that continues to resonate with our consumers. And the category offense continues to help us deliver segmented and differentiated retail destinations with our wholesale partners in our stores and online. Executions such as the Fieldhouse with Dick's Sporting Goods and the House of Hoops with Foot Locker performed very well in the quarter, as did our DTC business, which delivered revenue growth of 15% and continued strong growth on NIKE.com. Overall, we continue to see tremendous potential for growth in North America as demand remains strong and our brand continues to resonate with consumers.\r\nIn Western Europe, we're seeing broad-based demand with revenue growth of 21% in the quarter. We saw growth across all categories and territories with particular strength in AGS, the U.K. and Southern Europe. A critical part of our successful growth strategy in Western Europe is the work we've done to transform the marketplace along the category offense. We continue to develop more differentiated retail executions with our wholesale partners in our stores and online while continuing to bring innovative products into the marketplace.\r\nThe JD omni-channel store at Trafford and the Pro Direct digital store in London are a great example of powerful avenues we have to differentiate the NIKE Brand. In addition, we continue to see strong performance in our stores, with DTC up 40% and strong growth on NIKE.com. It remains early days yet, but the market growth we're seeing in nearly every territory, coupled with the market share gains, prove the success of our efforts in Western Europe.\r\nLet's turn to the emerging markets where revenue grew 12% in the quarter, with 6 of the 9 territories growing double-digits. We also saw strong growth coming from Sportswear, Running and Basketball. While we feel good about the third quarter results in the emerging markets, we do anticipate some choppiness going forward. Futures declined 6% for the period, in part the result of tough comparisons to the strong World Cup orders in the prior year. We are also taking proactive steps to reduce the supply to ensure a healthy marketplace in Mexico and Brazil, 2 of our largest territories in the emerging markets.\r\nIn Mexico, as we have discussed on previous calls, inventory levels in the marketplace were higher than we would like, largely a result of transition issues with our distribution center in early fiscal 2014. We've made significant progress in clearing the excess inventory in Mexico, and we expect to return to more normalized levels by the end of fiscal year '15. To ensure a healthy pull market, we've also worked proactively with our wholesale partners to adjust the flow of product into the marketplace, which contributes to the year-over-year decline in future orders for the emerging markets.\r\nIn Brazil, Q3 revenue growth was modest as volatile macroeconomic conditions made for a challenging operating environment. The NIKE Brand continues to be incredibly strong in Brazil, and we see great opportunity to reposition this critical market for sustainable, profitable growth. As we successfully did in North America, China and Western Europe, we will leverage the category offense to segment and differentiate our points of distribution. In doing so, we will increase the productivity and profitability of the marketplace. We will accomplish this by elevating the retail experiences for our consumers and presenting our products in more compelling and premium execution. As we start to reset the market in Brazil, we are working proactively with our wholesale partners to pace the flow of product into the market. As with Mexico, this is also contributing to the year-over-year decline in the emerging markets futures orders.\r\nWe are confident that our actions in Mexico and Brazil will help us to reach our goal of operating a healthy pull market in these important territories. And long term, we remain confident that the emerging markets geography will drive significant growth for the NIKE Brand.\r\nLastly, in Greater China, we continue to see the benefits of our strategy to reset the marketplace. Q3 revenue growth was 17%, and futures are up 23%. This reflects the continued strength of the NIKE Brand in the market along with our efforts to execute a more consumer-focused distribution strategy. Our wholesale partners have continued to see strong comp store growth and expanded profitability in the doors that have been re-profiled. This success aligns with the results we've seen in our own retail doors. Additionally, inventory levels in China continue to be healthy, letting us better serve the consumer and maintain a strong pull market. Given the success we've seen in the marketplace over the last several quarters, we are now focused on evolving from a reset strategy to a new normal of how we do business in China. As we look ahead, we continue to see tremendous opportunity for growth in this key geography.\r\nUltimately, I feel great about the results we delivered in Q3. And while we will continue to face macroeconomic challenges going forward, we know there's tremendous momentum in the marketplace. And we know the NIKE Brand continues to resonate with consumers all around the world, and we know our relentless focus on serving the consumer will keep us in the lead. We know all of this, and because we do, I personally could not be more excited about what the future holds.\r\nThanks. Now here's Don.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Trevor. In his opening remarks, Mark spoke about the tremendous macroeconomic volatility we've seen in recent months. In particular, over the last 90 days, the U.S. dollar has appreciated against virtually every other major currency. There's no question that this has and will continue to have an impact on multinational companies, including NIKE. We see these times as opportunities to distinguish ourselves, both in how we deliver for our consumers and how we deliver for our shareholders. The power of our brands and our portfolio, the strength of our balance sheet and the experience of our management team all give us the ability to navigate these conditions in a way few companies can.\r\nWe've always run our business to deliver appropriate near-term profitability, invest for long-term growth and manage risk. That approach hasn't changed. That doesn't mean this is business as usual. It does mean we'll use all the levers of our business to deliver profitable growth even in the face of strong macro headwinds. We'll continue to make focused investments to build strong brand connections, deliver innovative products and services and create compelling retail experiences for consumers. We'll leverage our strength with consumers to grow revenues and expand gross margins. We'll apply innovation and operational discipline to increase cost productivity. And we'll continue to deliver increasing profitability and cash returns to shareholders. We've been here before, and we're confident we have the business capabilities and momentum to deliver growth and profitability even under difficult economic circumstances.\r\nWith that introduction, I'll now recap our Q3 results. Third quarter reported revenue for NIKE, Inc. increased 7%. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue increased 13%, in line with our expectations, as the NIKE Brand grew 11% and Converse increased 33%. Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 11%, driven by a 6% increase in average selling price and a 5% increase in units. The growth reflects continued strong demand across the NIKE Brand portfolio led by double-digit growth in North America, China and Central and Eastern Europe.\r\nFrom a category perspective, the growth reflected strong demand across multiple categories, including Sportswear, Basketball and Running. This overall growth is especially noteworthy given last year's robust orders in advance of the 2014 World Cup, which particularly affected futures orders in Europe and the emerging markets. As Trevor mentioned earlier, excluding the impact of World Cup, we estimate futures would have increased at a mid-teens rate. On a reported basis, futures grew 2%, reflecting weaker international currencies, particularly the euro, reais, ruble, pound and yen.\r\nThird quarter diluted EPS increased 19% to $0.89, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower share count, partially offset by higher SG&A investments and a higher tax rate. In Q3, the impact of FX was insignificant as the impact of the stronger dollar was largely offset by our currency hedging programs.\r\nGross margin expanded 140 basis points in the quarter. The increase was driven by a continued shift to higher-margin products, partially offset by higher product input and warehousing costs.\r\nThird quarter demand creation was flat to last year as higher investments in digital and sports marketing were largely offset by lower advertising expenses due to changes in the timing of product launches. Q3 operating overhead increased 15%, reflecting growth in our higher gross margin, higher-cost DTC business, investments in operational infrastructure and continued investments in digital, including consumer engagement.\r\nThe Q3 effective tax rate was 24.4%, a 190 basis point increase versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to the impact of tax expense on intercompany transactions, partially offset by the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit.\r\nAt the end of Q3, NIKE, Inc. inventories were up 12%, primarily driven by unit growth in North America and Europe. As Trevor mentioned earlier, our North America business was affected by congestion at West Coast ports, reducing Q3 revenue growth and increasing Q3 inventories. While we anticipate the flow of product will soon begin to return to normal, we expect we will have somewhat higher inventory levels and lower margins in North America for the next few quarters as we work to rebalance supply and demand in the market.\r\nNow let's take a look at some of the performance highlights by segment. In North America, Q3 revenue increased 6% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis, led by Basketball and Sportswear. Direct-to-Consumer revenues grew 15%, driven by the rapid expansion of NIKE.com, 7% comp store sales growth and the addition of new stores. On a reported basis, Q3 EBIT for North America grew 14%, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.\r\nIn Western Europe, Q3 revenues increased 21% on a currency-neutral basis. The growth was broad-based as nearly every territory increased at a double-digit rate and every key category grew, led by double-digit growth in Sportswear, Men's Training -- sorry, Women's Training and Running. Despite the weaker euro, reported Q3 revenue for Western Europe increased 10% and EBIT increased 22%, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.\r\nIn Central and Eastern Europe, Q3 revenue increased 7% on a currency-neutral basis. Most territories delivered double-digit revenue growth, but revenues in Russia, Israel and Turkey declined. Nearly every key category expanded, led by Sportswear, Women's Training and Running. Reported revenue for CEE declined 10% and EBIT fell 35%, reflecting significantly weaker currencies, most significantly in Russia.\r\nIn Greater China, Q3 revenues increased 17% on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Sportswear, Basketball and Running. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue for China increased 15% while EBIT increased 7%, driven by strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by investments in demand creation and DTC.\r\nIn the emerging markets geography, Q3 revenue grew 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong growth in all territories except Brazil, which grew at a single-digit rate, and Mexico, which declined mid-teens. From a category perspective, the growth was led by Sportswear, Running and Basketball. On a reported basis, emerging markets revenue increased 2% and EBIT increased 3%, reflecting significant currency headwinds.\r\nAs Trevor discussed, we're seeing the results of our work to clear excess inventory in Mexico. At the same time, we're taking action to realign the Brazil marketplace along the lines of the category offense. We're confident these steps will set us up to continue to deliver sustainable, profitable growth in these territories and to the emerging markets geography as a whole.\r\nAt Converse, Q3 revenue grew 33% on a currency-neutral basis, boosted by the acceleration of Q4 shipments in advance of a major systems go live. The balance of the growth was driven by continued strength in North America, the conversion of several European markets to direct distribution and strong growth in DTC. On a reported basis, Converse revenue increased 28% and EBIT increased 23%, driven by revenue growth, partially offset by higher investments in infrastructure, DTC and demand creation to enable long-term growth.\r\nWe've seen strong momentum in our business year-to-date, and we expect that momentum to continue into Q4 and beyond. That said, FX headwinds have intensified significantly in the last 90 days, especially from the erosion of the value of the euro. While our hedging programs have significantly reduced the impact of FX on profitability, we cannot eliminate all currency risk. \r\nBased on what we know today, we expect the following for Q4 and full year FY '15. We expect constant dollar revenue growth for Q4 in the low-double digits, with reported revenue growth 8 to 9 points lower, reflecting the significantly stronger dollar. For the full year, we expect constant dollar revenue growth in the low-teens, with reported revenue growth 4 to 5 points lower.\r\nWe now expect Q4 gross margin to be flat to up about 25 basis points as the impact of higher closeouts, particularly in North America and Europe, largely offset the ongoing benefits of mix shifts to higher-margin products and businesses. For the full year, we now expect gross margin expansion of about 100 basis points.\r\nWe expect demand creation to decrease at a high-single digit rate for Q4 as we anniversary investments in World Cup marketing in Q4 of FY '14. For the full year, we now expect demand creation to grow at a mid-single digit rate.\r\nWe expect operating overhead to grow at a high-single to low-double digit rate for Q4 and at a mid-teens rate for the full year, reflecting higher DTC expenses, as well as investments in digital innovation and new operating capabilities.\r\nWe continue to expect the effective tax rate for FY '15 will be approximately 24.5%.\r\nLooking ahead to FY '16, we haven't yet completed our planning but can provide some initial thoughts. We expect to see continued strong momentum in our business and anticipate currency-neutral revenue growth for FY '16, slightly above our high-single digit target range. When combined with the impact of our ongoing work to expand gross margins and ongoing investments in our growth strategies, we would have expected EPS growth at or above our long-term mid-teens target.\r\nThat said, the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against nearly every other major currency will reduce next year's reported revenue, gross margin and profit. Assuming exchange rates remain in about the same range as they are today, we expect FY '16 reported revenue growth in the mid-single digits and EPS growth in the high-single to low-double digit range. Currency markets remain volatile, so we will provide an update on our FY '16 expectations on our Q4 earnings call.\r\nOn our last conference call, I spoke about one of our NIKE maxims, and today, I'd like to highlight another. We are on the offense always. As Mark said at the outset, we view a challenging operating environment as an opportunity to create further competitive separation. By staying focused on consumers and leveraging our strengths, we're confident we can continue to deliver strong financial performance and create value for our shareholders even in a challenging macroeconomic environment.\r\nWe're now ready to take your questions.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nThank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's fiscal 2015 third quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, or at our website, investors.nike.com.\r\nJoining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker; followed by Trevor Edwards, President of the NIKE Brand; and finally, you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you for your cooperation on this.\r\nI'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nThank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone. Well, we delivered another strong quarter in Q3. Revenues grew 7% to $7.5 billion; gross margin increased by 140 basis points to 45.9%; and diluted earnings per share increased 19% to $0.89.\r\nWe were able to deliver results like these for the quarter by leveraging the power of the NIKE portfolio. Over the last 3 months, the macro environment has become increasingly volatile. Foreign currency headwinds have intensified, product input costs continued to fluctuate and the political landscape is evolving in many countries around the world. This is the environment in which all multinational companies now operate, and NIKE is not immune to it.\r\nThe difference for NIKE, however, is that we see this as an opportunity to create further separation in the marketplace. Our globally diverse portfolio of geographies, categories, brands, product types and distribution channels gives us a distinct competitive advantage. By going deep into the business, we are able to see opportunities to serve the consumer and drive growth despite the choppier landscape. This surgical approach to finding new dimensions of growth ensures we capture the full potential of our brands around the world. And that includes driving strong growth in the areas of our business that are already well established such as Western Europe, China, North America in footwear as well as businesses such as women's, young athletes, apparel and e-commerce where we are accelerating development. These are just a few examples of the dimensions of our business where we are continuing to identify further opportunities to expand our reach and drive growth.\r\nAnd we do this while maintaining a disciplined approach to investing in those opportunities with the highest potential for return so we can drive growth and manage risk over the short and the long term. This complete offense is how we can continue to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. As you have seen from NIKE in the past, we know how to operate in a challenging environment better than anyone, and you will continue to see us leverage the breadth and depth of our global portfolio to do just that going forward.\r\nAt NIKE, everything we do starts with the consumer. It's our obsession with serving the consumer that sharpens our focus and drives our growth. The expectations of our consumers are evolving rapidly, and we're able to meet and often exceed those expectations because we know the athlete. By working with athletes at all levels, from the elite to the everyday, we have a level of knowledge and insight that is unmatched in our industry. And we are able to use the insights that we gain to create new product and services that drive new levels of performance innovation across all of our categories.\r\nThe pace of innovation at NIKE has never been faster, and our pipeline has never been more robust. We're leveraging new tools and processes to unlock significant advancements every day. However, the starting point for innovation remains the same, and that's the athlete. Many of our greatest innovations have come from going deep into an individual sport to solve a unique athletic need. And let me highlight a few examples in our footwear business from Q3.\r\nIn Running, the LunarTempo is a shoe that merges speed with cushioning for a great ride over the longer runs; and then the newly redesigned Air Max 2015, our most flexible, comfortable Air Max to date. We're seeing very strong response from consumers, and I'm tremendously excited about the pipeline of products in the Running category.\r\nIn Basketball, with his 10th signature shoe, Kobe Bryant returned to a low top and once again pushed the limits of design. In addition to great consumer reaction to the KOBE X, players around the NBA are wearing it for its great traction and cushioning.\r\nAnd in Football, the Nike Vapor Untouchable cleat was created to provide the game's fastest players with power and precision on the field. We've had tremendous feedback on the performance and the look of the Untouchable from the athletes at both the NFL and the collegiate level.\r\nAnd in Men's Training, the Nike MetCon 1, a first of its kind high-intensity training shoe that has been incredibly popular in the marketplace, and it's just a hint at what's to come in Men's Training.\r\nThese innovations each deliver a new level of performance for the athlete. However, we only truly realize our potential as a company when we continue to leverage those breakthroughs across multiple sports and categories. It's what you've seen from us time and time again. Many of our biggest footwear platforms such as Lunar and Free, Flyknit and Nike Air were initially created to solve a specific athlete need in a specific category. But now they serve as the foundation for our greatest products across multiple categories.\r\nSimilarly, in apparel, platforms such as Aeroloft and Dri-FIT, both originally introduced in Running, set the standard for thermoregulation and moisture management in multiple categories and product classifications. And our Nike Pro collection continues to drive energy in all sports, especially our Pro Bra and Tight collections for women.\r\nIndividually and collectively, our product innovation is breaking new ground across all of our categories. And as excited as we are about the technical details of these products, what's most important is how well our products are resonating with athletes and consumers, which we clearly saw in the quarter.\r\nInnovation fuels more than product at NIKE. It also drives how we do business and how we connect with the world. In the case of our digital ecosystem, NIKE is growing a connected community of athletes all over the world. This community is seamlessly engaged with the brand not only by accepting the world's best product, but by fueling activity and improving their athletic lives. We know it's not enough to simply to interact. True connections require depth and richness. And in Q3, we strengthened these digital connections and added new dimensions to our digital ecosystem.\r\nSo how does NIKE continue to expand our digital innovation?  Well, we linked experience to commerce. We released the Nike SNKRS app during the NBA All-Star Game in New York, letting consumers on mobile devices see, share and buy our most coveted footwear products. And we broadened access. We announced several partnerships with the Nike+ Running app to let runners connect to Nike+ experiences to even more of their devices and fitness equipment. And we glow -- we grow our global reach. We added more sharing capabilities to our Nike+ Training Club app. We expanded it to 18 languages. It's work like this that will continue to power our digital experiences for years to come.\r\nAt the same time, in Q3, we continued to see tremendous growth in our e-commerce business as NIKE.com was up 42% in the quarter. Traffic and conversion both increased. And for the first time in our history, mobile traffic exceeded desktop traffic, helped in part by the introduction of our SNKRS app. And going forward, we will continue to invest in this area to best serve our consumer. \r\nAdditionally, we'll continue to drive growth in our e-commerce business by increasing consumer access to product customization. In Q3, for example, we brought exclusive new Flyknit options to NIKEiD, giving consumers the ability to take customization to yet another level. Overall, we continue to see tremendous potential for growth in our e-commerce business as we leverage our digital platform to continue to deliver premium products, services and experiences for our consumers.\r\nAs we head into the final quarter of fiscal 2015 and beyond, I continue to see tremendous opportunity for NIKE around the world. You've heard me say many times that I see more potential for growth going forward than at any time in our history, and I certainly continue to believe that today.\r\nWhile the current macro environment is challenging, it is not new to us. We have a highly experienced and aligned management team that knows how to continue to deliver profitable growth by turning challenges into opportunities. It's what we've always done in the past, and it's what you can expect from us going forward.\r\nThanks. And now here's Trevor.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nThanks, Mark. Q3 is a great example about how the strength of the NIKE Brand drives growth around the world, even in a more challenging macro environment. As Mark mentioned, the impact of foreign exchange has intensified, and Don will talk more about our work to mitigate those impacts. As I normally do, I'll speak to our results on a constant-currency basis. While we consider the impact of foreign exchange as part of the overall management of our business, currency-neutral results provide a clearer view of the underlying operational performance.\r\nSo let's take a look at the numbers. The NIKE Brand revenue grew 11% with strong growth in Western Europe, Greater China and the emerging markets, as well as in our Sportswear and Basketball categories. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 29%, driven by all concepts in all geographies. And as Mark mentioned, we also saw continued strong growth in NIKE.com. And global futures are up 11%, reflecting the strong growth despite comparisons to the prior year, which included strong World Cup demand. Excluding the impact of the World Cup, we estimate future orders would have grown in the mid-teens.\r\nAs Q3 growth -- our Q3 growth is a result of the deep relationships we've built with consumers through the category offense. Our laser focus on individual consumers strengthens our -- those connections, whether they are online, at retail or at live experiences. NIKE's consistent focus on serving the consumer through the lens of their chosen sports helps enable continued profitable growth.\r\nWhat's more, only NIKE has the global scale to execute this consumer-focused strategy in markets around the world. As we further drive the category offense globally, we continue to prove our ability to connect our brands to consumers and build compelling retail destinations that elevate, segment and differentiate the markets around the globe.\r\nTo see the category offense in action, let's first take a look at 2 of our key categories: Basketball and Running. Both NIKE and the Jordan Brand continue to deliver the absolute best in Basketball, with innovative products and groundbreaking experiences. Q3 was the 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for the Basketball category. And as the game expands around the globe, we continue to see amazing opportunity for growth in this important category. Q3 was a great example of the combined power of Nike Basketball and Brand Jordan to create excitement and energy in the marketplace. I was in New York City for the NBA All-Star weekend, and it was clearly an electric experience for hundreds and thousands of basketball fans who took part. All over the city, NIKE and Brand Jordan executed retail concepts and consumer experiences that showcase basketball's unique culture and passion.\r\nNike Basketball invited fans to visit the Zoom City Arena, offering them a chance to play on the first digital LED court in the United States. Brand Jordan transformed the Penn Pavilion into an interactive consumer experience where fans could relive Michael Jordan's iconic game-winning shots. And both brands created elevated retail executions at NIKETOWN at House of Hoops locations with Foot Locker and at pop-up locations around the city. All of this combined to deliver a truly one-of-a-kind experience for our consumers, something only NIKE can do.\r\nIn addition to delivering highly engaging consumer experiences, we continued to lead with innovative product. In the quarter, Kyrie Irving, one of the most exciting young players in the game today, became the newest signature athlete for NIKE with the launch of the KYRIE 1. Offering superior traction with the Hyperfuse construction, the KYRIE 1 is an excellent example of how we never stop improving. Also, seeing huge consumer response was the KOBE X, the most coveted shoe yet for the popular KOBE line.\r\nNext, let's talk about Running. As you know, Running is our heritage and our largest performance category. The NIKE Brand continues to resonate with runners, fueled by the Nike+ Run Club and grassroots running events around the world. And the Running category continues to deliver strong results in key geographies, including Europe, China and the emerging markets. That said, core footwear within the Running category isn't performing as well as we would like, particularly in North America. As a result, we are highly focused on delivering new innovation into our core product offerings to ensure we continue to serve our consumer with the absolute best.\r\nWith our premium performance products, we continue to see strong sell-through for footwear styles like the Air Max 2015, the LunarTempo and the Air Zoom Pegasus 31. In addition, our premium performance apparel continues to drive growth, and we saw strong consumer response to the styles such as the new Epic Lux and the Epic Run Tights.\r\nAs part of our Amplify strategy, we leverage the heritage of our Running into Sportswear to deliver great style for consumers who appreciate the aesthetic of running. This is our complete offense in the Running category. And Running-inspired Sportswear performed exceedingly well in the quarter, led by strong consumer response to the Roshe platform and the Roshe Flyknit in particular. The Air Max 1 Collection also had strong performance in the quarter.\r\nLooking ahead, we will continue to build on what's working in Running as we further strengthen our business to accelerate growth. We are excited to have a robust, continuous pipeline of groundbreaking footwear innovations, which we will bring to the market over the next 18 months. And we will also leverage the momentum in platforms such as the Lunar, Flyknit and our Air Max to continue to drive growth. Overall, Running continues to be a tremendous source of innovation and inspiration for NIKE and one of our key long-term growth drivers.\r\nLet's talk about a few of our key geographies. First, North America, which delivered 6% revenue growth in the quarter. Consumer demand continues to be very strong in North America as most key categories grew and futures were up 15%. That said, revenue growth was somewhat lower than expected in the quarter due to challenges related to the port congestion on the West Coast, which escalated late in our fiscal quarter 3. As a result, some shipments originally expected for delivery in Q3 were delayed. Looking ahead, we expect revenue growth in quarter 4 to accelerate as the flow of product through the supply chain begins to normalize. However, we do expect it will take a few quarters to return to fully normalized product flow as there are a significant number of containers to be cleared from the ports on the West Coast.\r\nTo be very clear, there continues to be tremendous momentum for the NIKE Brand in North America, thanks to innovative product that continues to resonate with our consumers. And the category offense continues to help us deliver segmented and differentiated retail destinations with our wholesale partners in our stores and online. Executions such as the Fieldhouse with Dick's Sporting Goods and the House of Hoops with Foot Locker performed very well in the quarter, as did our DTC business, which delivered revenue growth of 15% and continued strong growth on NIKE.com. Overall, we continue to see tremendous potential for growth in North America as demand remains strong and our brand continues to resonate with consumers.\r\nIn Western Europe, we're seeing broad-based demand with revenue growth of 21% in the quarter. We saw growth across all categories and territories with particular strength in AGS, the U.K. and Southern Europe. A critical part of our successful growth strategy in Western Europe is the work we've done to transform the marketplace along the category offense. We continue to develop more differentiated retail executions with our wholesale partners in our stores and online while continuing to bring innovative products into the marketplace.\r\nThe JD omni-channel store at Trafford and the Pro Direct digital store in London are a great example of powerful avenues we have to differentiate the NIKE Brand. In addition, we continue to see strong performance in our stores, with DTC up 40% and strong growth on NIKE.com. It remains early days yet, but the market growth we're seeing in nearly every territory, coupled with the market share gains, prove the success of our efforts in Western Europe.\r\nLet's turn to the emerging markets where revenue grew 12% in the quarter, with 6 of the 9 territories growing double-digits. We also saw strong growth coming from Sportswear, Running and Basketball. While we feel good about the third quarter results in the emerging markets, we do anticipate some choppiness going forward. Futures declined 6% for the period, in part the result of tough comparisons to the strong World Cup orders in the prior year. We are also taking proactive steps to reduce the supply to ensure a healthy marketplace in Mexico and Brazil, 2 of our largest territories in the emerging markets.\r\nIn Mexico, as we have discussed on previous calls, inventory levels in the marketplace were higher than we would like, largely a result of transition issues with our distribution center in early fiscal 2014. We've made significant progress in clearing the excess inventory in Mexico, and we expect to return to more normalized levels by the end of fiscal year '15. To ensure a healthy pull market, we've also worked proactively with our wholesale partners to adjust the flow of product into the marketplace, which contributes to the year-over-year decline in future orders for the emerging markets.\r\nIn Brazil, Q3 revenue growth was modest as volatile macroeconomic conditions made for a challenging operating environment. The NIKE Brand continues to be incredibly strong in Brazil, and we see great opportunity to reposition this critical market for sustainable, profitable growth. As we successfully did in North America, China and Western Europe, we will leverage the category offense to segment and differentiate our points of distribution. In doing so, we will increase the productivity and profitability of the marketplace. We will accomplish this by elevating the retail experiences for our consumers and presenting our products in more compelling and premium execution. As we start to reset the market in Brazil, we are working proactively with our wholesale partners to pace the flow of product into the market. As with Mexico, this is also contributing to the year-over-year decline in the emerging markets futures orders.\r\nWe are confident that our actions in Mexico and Brazil will help us to reach our goal of operating a healthy pull market in these important territories. And long term, we remain confident that the emerging markets geography will drive significant growth for the NIKE Brand.\r\nLastly, in Greater China, we continue to see the benefits of our strategy to reset the marketplace. Q3 revenue growth was 17%, and futures are up 23%. This reflects the continued strength of the NIKE Brand in the market along with our efforts to execute a more consumer-focused distribution strategy. Our wholesale partners have continued to see strong comp store growth and expanded profitability in the doors that have been re-profiled. This success aligns with the results we've seen in our own retail doors. Additionally, inventory levels in China continue to be healthy, letting us better serve the consumer and maintain a strong pull market. Given the success we've seen in the marketplace over the last several quarters, we are now focused on evolving from a reset strategy to a new normal of how we do business in China. As we look ahead, we continue to see tremendous opportunity for growth in this key geography.\r\nUltimately, I feel great about the results we delivered in Q3. And while we will continue to face macroeconomic challenges going forward, we know there's tremendous momentum in the marketplace. And we know the NIKE Brand continues to resonate with consumers all around the world, and we know our relentless focus on serving the consumer will keep us in the lead. We know all of this, and because we do, I personally could not be more excited about what the future holds.\r\nThanks. Now here's Don.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nThanks, Trevor. In his opening remarks, Mark spoke about the tremendous macroeconomic volatility we've seen in recent months. In particular, over the last 90 days, the U.S. dollar has appreciated against virtually every other major currency. There's no question that this has and will continue to have an impact on multinational companies, including NIKE. We see these times as opportunities to distinguish ourselves, both in how we deliver for our consumers and how we deliver for our shareholders. The power of our brands and our portfolio, the strength of our balance sheet and the experience of our management team all give us the ability to navigate these conditions in a way few companies can.\r\nWe've always run our business to deliver appropriate near-term profitability, invest for long-term growth and manage risk. That approach hasn't changed. That doesn't mean this is business as usual. It does mean we'll use all the levers of our business to deliver profitable growth even in the face of strong macro headwinds. We'll continue to make focused investments to build strong brand connections, deliver innovative products and services and create compelling retail experiences for consumers. We'll leverage our strength with consumers to grow revenues and expand gross margins. We'll apply innovation and operational discipline to increase cost productivity. And we'll continue to deliver increasing profitability and cash returns to shareholders. We've been here before, and we're confident we have the business capabilities and momentum to deliver growth and profitability even under difficult economic circumstances.\r\nWith that introduction, I'll now recap our Q3 results. Third quarter reported revenue for NIKE, Inc. increased 7%. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue increased 13%, in line with our expectations, as the NIKE Brand grew 11% and Converse increased 33%. Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 11%, driven by a 6% increase in average selling price and a 5% increase in units. The growth reflects continued strong demand across the NIKE Brand portfolio led by double-digit growth in North America, China and Central and Eastern Europe.\r\nFrom a category perspective, the growth reflected strong demand across multiple categories, including Sportswear, Basketball and Running. This overall growth is especially noteworthy given last year's robust orders in advance of the 2014 World Cup, which particularly affected futures orders in Europe and the emerging markets. As Trevor mentioned earlier, excluding the impact of World Cup, we estimate futures would have increased at a mid-teens rate. On a reported basis, futures grew 2%, reflecting weaker international currencies, particularly the euro, reais, ruble, pound and yen.\r\nThird quarter diluted EPS increased 19% to $0.89, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower share count, partially offset by higher SG&A investments and a higher tax rate. In Q3, the impact of FX was insignificant as the impact of the stronger dollar was largely offset by our currency hedging programs.\r\nGross margin expanded 140 basis points in the quarter. The increase was driven by a continued shift to higher-margin products, partially offset by higher product input and warehousing costs.\r\nThird quarter demand creation was flat to last year as higher investments in digital and sports marketing were largely offset by lower advertising expenses due to changes in the timing of product launches. Q3 operating overhead increased 15%, reflecting growth in our higher gross margin, higher-cost DTC business, investments in operational infrastructure and continued investments in digital, including consumer engagement.\r\nThe Q3 effective tax rate was 24.4%, a 190 basis point increase versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to the impact of tax expense on intercompany transactions, partially offset by the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit.\r\nAt the end of Q3, NIKE, Inc. inventories were up 12%, primarily driven by unit growth in North America and Europe. As Trevor mentioned earlier, our North America business was affected by congestion at West Coast ports, reducing Q3 revenue growth and increasing Q3 inventories. While we anticipate the flow of product will soon begin to return to normal, we expect we will have somewhat higher inventory levels and lower margins in North America for the next few quarters as we work to rebalance supply and demand in the market.\r\nNow let's take a look at some of the performance highlights by segment. In North America, Q3 revenue increased 6% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis, led by Basketball and Sportswear. Direct-to-Consumer revenues grew 15%, driven by the rapid expansion of NIKE.com, 7% comp store sales growth and the addition of new stores. On a reported basis, Q3 EBIT for North America grew 14%, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.\r\nIn Western Europe, Q3 revenues increased 21% on a currency-neutral basis. The growth was broad-based as nearly every territory increased at a double-digit rate and every key category grew, led by double-digit growth in Sportswear, Men's Training -- sorry, Women's Training and Running. Despite the weaker euro, reported Q3 revenue for Western Europe increased 10% and EBIT increased 22%, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.\r\nIn Central and Eastern Europe, Q3 revenue increased 7% on a currency-neutral basis. Most territories delivered double-digit revenue growth, but revenues in Russia, Israel and Turkey declined. Nearly every key category expanded, led by Sportswear, Women's Training and Running. Reported revenue for CEE declined 10% and EBIT fell 35%, reflecting significantly weaker currencies, most significantly in Russia.\r\nIn Greater China, Q3 revenues increased 17% on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Sportswear, Basketball and Running. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue for China increased 15% while EBIT increased 7%, driven by strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by investments in demand creation and DTC.\r\nIn the emerging markets geography, Q3 revenue grew 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong growth in all territories except Brazil, which grew at a single-digit rate, and Mexico, which declined mid-teens. From a category perspective, the growth was led by Sportswear, Running and Basketball. On a reported basis, emerging markets revenue increased 2% and EBIT increased 3%, reflecting significant currency headwinds.\r\nAs Trevor discussed, we're seeing the results of our work to clear excess inventory in Mexico. At the same time, we're taking action to realign the Brazil marketplace along the lines of the category offense. We're confident these steps will set us up to continue to deliver sustainable, profitable growth in these territories and to the emerging markets geography as a whole.\r\nAt Converse, Q3 revenue grew 33% on a currency-neutral basis, boosted by the acceleration of Q4 shipments in advance of a major systems go live. The balance of the growth was driven by continued strength in North America, the conversion of several European markets to direct distribution and strong growth in DTC. On a reported basis, Converse revenue increased 28% and EBIT increased 23%, driven by revenue growth, partially offset by higher investments in infrastructure, DTC and demand creation to enable long-term growth.\r\nWe've seen strong momentum in our business year-to-date, and we expect that momentum to continue into Q4 and beyond. That said, FX headwinds have intensified significantly in the last 90 days, especially from the erosion of the value of the euro. While our hedging programs have significantly reduced the impact of FX on profitability, we cannot eliminate all currency risk. \r\nBased on what we know today, we expect the following for Q4 and full year FY '15. We expect constant dollar revenue growth for Q4 in the low-double digits, with reported revenue growth 8 to 9 points lower, reflecting the significantly stronger dollar. For the full year, we expect constant dollar revenue growth in the low-teens, with reported revenue growth 4 to 5 points lower.\r\nWe now expect Q4 gross margin to be flat to up about 25 basis points as the impact of higher closeouts, particularly in North America and Europe, largely offset the ongoing benefits of mix shifts to higher-margin products and businesses. For the full year, we now expect gross margin expansion of about 100 basis points.\r\nWe expect demand creation to decrease at a high-single digit rate for Q4 as we anniversary investments in World Cup marketing in Q4 of FY '14. For the full year, we now expect demand creation to grow at a mid-single digit rate.\r\nWe expect operating overhead to grow at a high-single to low-double digit rate for Q4 and at a mid-teens rate for the full year, reflecting higher DTC expenses, as well as investments in digital innovation and new operating capabilities.\r\nWe continue to expect the effective tax rate for FY '15 will be approximately 24.5%.\r\nLooking ahead to FY '16, we haven't yet completed our planning but can provide some initial thoughts. We expect to see continued strong momentum in our business and anticipate currency-neutral revenue growth for FY '16, slightly above our high-single digit target range. When combined with the impact of our ongoing work to expand gross margins and ongoing investments in our growth strategies, we would have expected EPS growth at or above our long-term mid-teens target.\r\nThat said, the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against nearly every other major currency will reduce next year's reported revenue, gross margin and profit. Assuming exchange rates remain in about the same range as they are today, we expect FY '16 reported revenue growth in the mid-single digits and EPS growth in the high-single to low-double digit range. Currency markets remain volatile, so we will provide an update on our FY '16 expectations on our Q4 earnings call.\r\nOn our last conference call, I spoke about one of our NIKE maxims, and today, I'd like to highlight another. We are on the offense always. As Mark said at the outset, we view a challenging operating environment as an opportunity to create further competitive separation. By staying focused on consumers and leveraging our strengths, we're confident we can continue to deliver strong financial performance and create value for our shareholders even in a challenging macroeconomic environment.\r\nWe're now ready to take your questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "Don, I just want to say congratulations to you on your announcement.\n\n---\n\nThank you.\n\n---\n\nI have 2 questions today. One of was there was a very big article this week or late last week from Adidas talking about the NBA sponsorship and walking away from that. How would you view that opportunity? And can you just walk us through just sponsorship in general and how you're thinking about it for the future?\n\n---\n\nWell, with regards to the NBA, there's really nothing further to share at this time. We are, as you would imagine, always talking to the leagues, clubs and federations, but really nothing more to report on any specific conversations with the NBA sponsorship. But as you know, the relationships that we have with leagues, clubs, federations and, of course, the athletes are key. We gain the insights from the athletes that really ultimately drive the innovation that fuels NIKE's Brand strength and our growth as a company. So that's always been the case. I can't imagine that it wouldn't be going forward. We're selective in the choices that we make in terms of where we think we have the greatest opportunities. And we look at those opportunities in a very complete sort of holistic way. Very, very happy with where we are in Basketball and feel like there's tremendous potential going forward. Trevor talked about Jordan and Nike Basketball, incredible performance in the quarter and really strong outlook going forward. So we expect that our relationships with athletes, and at the collegiate level and the professional level, continue to be really an important part of that.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then my second question is on the supply chain. As we see faster speed to market from other apparel companies, can you talk about how you view this opportunity, how quickly the supply chain can be refined to address this?\n\n---\n\nKate, are you talking about the congestion at the West Coast ports?\n\n---\n\nI'm sorry, no, more of a longer-term strategy. I think a couple of retailers have indicated that they're looking for more freshness in the market. As you see a lot more speed to market from other manufacturers, I wondered if that was something that NIKE talked about and if there was any opportunity within the supply chain to address that.\n\n---\n\nWell, absolutely, Kate. We have made a number of different investments over time. And we continue to do that both in terms of how we operate our supply chain and more closely tied the timing of production and shipping all the way through to the final consumer, so certainly on that front. We've also, as you know, done a lot of work in the innovation space around how we manufacture product and how we design and develop it. For example, on the NFL, we've had to do some very different approaches to make sure that we're able to respond very quickly to changes in demand, whether it be for specific teams or specific athletes. And that goes all the way to the manufacturing revolution type of investments we've made around technologies like Flyknit. So we are putting a lot of money and a lot of resources against how our supply chain evolves to increase speed and make sure we deliver to consumers as quickly and as innovatively as we can.\n\n---\n\nGreat quarter. So there's a lot of talk about Flyknit marquee basketball price points. But can you touch on the mid-tier channel, the segmentation strategy you guys have, particularly any product innovation for us to watch and just kind of how you think about pricing power in that channel?\n\n---\n\nYes, it's -- obviously, we continue to make sure that we continue to focus our pricing strategy, certainly, around ensuring that we give great value to our consumers. So it's always a balance of price to value with the consumer. Our ability to bring new innovation allows us the ability to command certainly a premium price. And certainly, our brand strength does that, too. So obviously, one area that we talked about, which was the -- in the Running business, we talked certainly about the core and our ability to make sure we continue to stay focused on bringing more innovation there. Our Basketball business is very strong at the moment. And we feel it will continue to be strong because we have an incredible pipeline of new innovations that we keep bringing into the marketplace. So obviously, as you saw when we brought the Kyrie Irving -- the KYRIE shoe into the marketplace, we're just seeing tremendous response to those products. So we continue to feel, again, very confident about our ability to keep the excitement in the Basketball category while continuing to serve all the various segments, whether you're coming through the House of Hoops like at Foot Locker or you work in certainly more of a mid-tier account.\n\n---\n\nYes, I just want to quickly add that our innovation agenda is really about bringing a complete offense, which means across the categories, across the product types and up and down the price point spectrum. So that's really important to us. We have a major focus on elevating the state of innovation in our core product, and I think you'll see that coming through the pipeline here in the quarters ahead; very excited about that part of NIKE. But certainly, innovation is not reserved for the upper price point premium product. It runs up and down the price spectrum, and that's a very, very important part of our growth strategy going forward.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then so we've seen a clear top line and bottom line inflection really over the last 12 to 18 months. Mark, I'm curious when you take a step back, what do you think's been the largest enabler in the organization here as we've seen this inflection? And as we think about the category offense, what do you think -- what's the best way to think about the potential next leg of opportunity?\n\n---\n\nIn terms of the category offense?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, just largely, I'd be curious as you think about what's really changed in the organization to drive both the top and bottom line inflection that we've seen over really the last year to 2 years here.\n\n---\n\nWell, the category offense, just touching on that for a second, is really driving deeper insights into the marketplace, which really, as you know, drive the innovation, which creates the product, which drives growth for us. And it's not just the product innovation. It's also the insights in the consumer and consumer cultures, making sure the brand is resonating, we're relevant, we're connected. I think it's not so much a difference from where we've been. We're refining our ability to be highly creative and innovative but also really disciplined and operating in a much higher level across the various dimensions of the business. We have a management team here that is very much aligned, very experienced. We never take our success for granted. We're always looking for ways that we can improve, which is really important to me and I think NIKE's success to date. But we are probably our own biggest critic. But I think our ability to innovate and our ability to drive operational excellence at the same time is just -- it's never been at the level it is today, and I'm actually quite proud of that.\n\n---\n\nI actually wanted to ask my first question about the manufacturing revolution in the context of currency. They have been -- you and the industry largely have been producing in Asia and markets where the currencies are tied to the dollar, and the dollar, as you said, has seeing unprecedented strength against all other major currencies. Is now the time to kind of accelerate the process of maybe pulling manufacturing out of some of these markets and taking manufacturing to the end markets and using some of the automated technologies to allow yourself to produce in markets -- in the end markets where the costs will be aligned, at least from a currency perspective, where the sales are? Just your thoughts around that, if this changes the equation there.\n\n---\n\nWell, one of the things that I made a reference to this in the prepared remarks, Omar, is that when we implemented our trading company 4 or 5 years ago, one of the things that we did is we started deconstructing our payments to the factories into a basket of currencies as opposed to 1 currency, which lets us get natural offsets to some of the currency exposures. So we're getting some of the benefit that you're talking about here of matching sourcing currencies and selling currencies even within our existing structure. The second thing is that we've adjusted -- or we do adjust payments to the factories on the basis of how those currencies move. So we are getting some offsetting sourcing benefits right now from the fact that currencies in a lot of our sourcing countries are weakening. So that helps us also net down our foreign exchange exposure. With respect to your overall premise of trying to make sure that our manufacturing is closer both in proximity and time to where the product is sold, that is absolutely part of the strategy from a consumer standpoint. So I think when you look at the financial side of it, we're getting some of the benefits that you're describing through the way we've set up our trading company. And that's not stopping us from keeping the pedal down on driving manufacturing revolution because we think there's a huge consumer benefit to doing that as well.\n\n---\n\nWe definitely see the opportunity. The innovation agenda is really helping to create some efficiencies and opportunity to automate the manufacturing process, which ultimately will allow us to source more broadly down the road. And as Don said, that's a big part of our agenda.\n\n---\n\nThat's really helpful. And then a follow-up. Don, as you head into retirement, there's a lot of complex things going on in the global markets and currencies and the trading company that you set up. Mark also, how do you feel about the transition? Can you talk a little bit about the transition? Don's been there a really long time, obviously knows the business extremely well. Can you help us understand why we shouldn't be concerned about the transition going on in the CFO position?\n\n---\n\nWell, let me take the first cut at that. First of all, rumors of my departure are premature here because I will still be in this role through the end of July. So you're not quite rid of me yet. I am tremendously excited about the next chapter in my life, but I'm also extraordinarily excited about the prospects for NIKE and have tremendous confidence in both the management team as well as my successor, Andy Campion. Certainly, Mark can speak for himself on that. But you're not quite rid of me yet, and I feel real excited about it.\n\n---\n\nWell, since you brought it up, I'll just say that Don's impact here has been absolutely tremendous through the years. I personally have nothing but incredible respect for Don and the impact that he's made at NIKE. I wasn't going to go here. It's a little premature, as Don said. But I will say that I'm also incredibly confident in Don's successor early into fiscal '16. Andy Campion has -- is really a seasoned NIKE veteran, and he's been under the tutelage of Don and the incredible financial leadership team here at NIKE. And I have tremendous confidence in Andy's ability to take the reins and continue the momentum that Don's helped create for us going forward. More on that as we move forward.\n\n---\n\nDon, congratulations on your retirement.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Omar.\n\n---\n\nSo my 2 questions. First, Trevor, you mentioned in your comments the core footwear in Running in North America not performing quite as well as you guys would like. I was wondering if you might share with us sort of more what is going on there. Is it a fashion shift? Is this a product presentation? Or what are some of the things that we should be looking for that could get that going again? And then the second question is just as you look over the next year or so in Europe, the sort of need and ability to raise prices over there to offset all the FX changes and how you guys are thinking about that?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Certainly, Robby. The -- I think the first thing I want to just maybe communicate is that Running -- our brand continues to really resonate with runners in North America. And one of the things I want to do is maybe unpack a little bit about how we view the business. And we always talk about what we say is the amplified offense, which really gives you a greater view of the marketplace. And so when you take a look at it, you have the performance segment, you have the core segment, and you have the Running-inspired segment. And so if you break those down, in the performance segment, we're seeing tremendous success of the new parts that we've been bringing to marketplace. So we -- whether you take the Air Pegasus 31 or the Max 2015 or any of those products, they're doing really, really well. And so we feel obviously very, very confident about that. As I mentioned, in the core footwear, we think there's opportunity for us to do better in that zone. And so as Mark said, we're going to continue to bring more innovation and strengthen that part of the business. The other dimension is the Running-inspired business, which I mentioned, which are things like the Roshe, which really speak to more the aesthetic side or certainly people who like the aesthetic for the style component of Running. And that's doing really well. So all in all, the Running business core performance is where we see some challenges, but the rest of the business really continues to do really well. In addition, the apparel is also doing really, really well in the marketplace. So we feel we're connected with runners in a great way. Lastly, I would say that I'm very confident about the innovations we're going to continue to bring in the marketplace over the next 18 months. We have a robust pipeline. So I'm really excited about doing that and making sure that we continue. Futures are actually up 15%. So we feel confident about the Running business and its impact in the marketplace.\n\n---\n\nRobby, just to clarify, futures are up 15% for North America. Futures are also strong in both footwear and apparel for the total Running category globally.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then...\n\n---\n\nAnd to your second question -- go ahead, Robby.\n\n---\n\nYes. Back to Europe. Yes, yes Europe, just pricing increases and how much of that is maybe, Don, in some of the guidance, the preliminary guidance you gave us.\n\n---\n\nYes, just the first piece would be the way we approach these things, which is when we think about managing the business on a long term and how we move all the levers in the business. So just because the euro has gone down dramatically doesn't mean we're going to try to get all of that back with pricing in Europe. And we're going to pull all the levers to deliver against our goals. We do have in our expectations for FY '16 that we will continue to migrate consumers to premium. We're continuing to manage mix. And if you look at the way our business has performed over the last few years, I think we've been very successful in moving average price points higher, and we would expect to do that. What I wouldn't look for is trying to get all of a very big move in currency back in the near term with huge price increases in any one piece of geography. We play for the long term.\n\n---\n\nDon, congratulations. Best of luck.\n\n---\n\nThank you.\n\n---\n\nAnd maybe I guess the 2 questions that I have, the first one is with the U.S. business like with some of the challenges, I think you called out the Running pieces of it. But would you attribute any of the challenges in the U.S. business this quarter to cannibalization or potential cannibalization given the big increase that you've generated on the Direct-to-Consumer piece?\n\n---\n\nNo, I wouldn't. I said that we continue to see great momentum in North America. And as I mentioned earlier, the 15% futures growth continues to give us confidence about the business in North America. Obviously, we do have -- our DTC business is growing, but we're also growing very well and we have a great relationship with our wholesale partners. So we feel very confident about the way the business is growing and how the brand continues to resonate with consumer. The demand for the brand is really high in North America and actually around the world.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then a question on the futures with the reported period. Can you just talk about like the first half of the order period versus the second half? And was it stronger in the second half or in the first half? Like how can we think about that?\n\n---\n\nFutures are a little stronger in the second half of the window.\n\n---\n\nGot it, okay. And then just the last question is what do you guys have the -- at UAB in your brackets?\n\n---\n\nNot going to go there.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to ask about your women's apparel or just the women's business in North America. You've had a couple of very high-profile initiatives, some shifts on sponsorship and marketing. And then also, we've seen a number of the Training Club shop-in-shops in Macy's. Can you give us an update on your progress in women's apparel and maybe some of the specific things you have in the pipeline for the next few quarters?\n\n---\n\nOkay, yes. Our women's business, I'm obviously very excited about the progress in our women's business. Our women's business really across not only North America, but really around the world, continues to grow at a really rapid pace. In fact, it's outpacing our men's business. And our strategy to really focus on the run, train and live component of the business, every dimension is actually growing, both footwear and apparel. As well as some of the things that we've done certainly around the community work with the services that we're providing, they're also doing really well. So it really is a case of every dimension of this is actually working really well. So we're really excited. Some of the things to really point to, whether it's the Epic Lux Tights, the bras that we've just recently launched, some of the great footwear, all of those things are doing really, really well both in our doors, in dotcom as well as with our wholesale partners. So we feel really, really pleased about the progress.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And just a quick maybe housekeeping item. I'm sorry if you answered this already. But beyond the port delays, were there any other factors that drove the disconnect between your North America sales versus what futures orders suggested they might be in the quarter?\n\n---\n\nYes, we also had some weather-related delays in the South. There were some ice storms down there. So we lost some shipping and so on. So there's quite a bit of supply chain noise in Q3, which, as we said in the prepared remarks, we do expect that's going to sort out over the next few quarters. But as Trevor said, demand extraordinarily strong in North America, futures up 15%, so feeling really good about the underlying strength of the business.\n\n---\n\nFirst, Don, congratulations on the well-deserved pending retirement.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Jim.\n\n---\n\nA couple other questions. E-commerce growth has been a standout. I know it's also been also a big area for investment. As we look into fiscal '16, is that business at a point where we can lever some of those investments? Or do you expect the investments there to continue to drag on the profitability?\n\n---\n\nWell, first thing I would say is the profitability is growing faster than the revenue. So we're continuing to drive both top line and bottom line on e-commerce. So number one is this has been a winner both from a growth and a profitability standpoint. The second thing is we are going to continue to invest in digital. We believe that's where the consumer is and is going. And that's where our brand is and is going, and so we're going to continue to invest there. But from an economic standpoint, it's been a very positive driver for business, both top and bottom line.\n\n---\n\nGreat to hear. And then next question on China. Sales turning nicely, but the profit growth in the quarter lagged. Is that simply a function of timing of investments? Or is there some broader influence of the repositioning in the market?\n\n---\n\nNo, I really -- I think from the China perspective, obviously, we're very pleased with the continued growth. No, none of the -- it's probably more just at this point in time, but I would -- it's not something that we would envision over the long term.\n\n---\n\nWell, thank you, everyone, for joining us, and we'll look forward to talking to you on our Q4 call.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Kate McShane (Analysts)】\nDon, I just want to say congratulations to you on your announcement.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nThank you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kate McShane (Analysts)】\nI have 2 questions today. One of was there was a very big article this week or late last week from Adidas talking about the NBA sponsorship and walking away from that. How would you view that opportunity? And can you just walk us through just sponsorship in general and how you're thinking about it for the future?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nWell, with regards to the NBA, there's really nothing further to share at this time. We are, as you would imagine, always talking to the leagues, clubs and federations, but really nothing more to report on any specific conversations with the NBA sponsorship. But as you know, the relationships that we have with leagues, clubs, federations and, of course, the athletes are key. We gain the insights from the athletes that really ultimately drive the innovation that fuels NIKE's Brand strength and our growth as a company. So that's always been the case. I can't imagine that it wouldn't be going forward. We're selective in the choices that we make in terms of where we think we have the greatest opportunities. And we look at those opportunities in a very complete sort of holistic way. Very, very happy with where we are in Basketball and feel like there's tremendous potential going forward. Trevor talked about Jordan and Nike Basketball, incredible performance in the quarter and really strong outlook going forward. So we expect that our relationships with athletes, and at the collegiate level and the professional level, continue to be really an important part of that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kate McShane (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then my second question is on the supply chain. As we see faster speed to market from other apparel companies, can you talk about how you view this opportunity, how quickly the supply chain can be refined to address this?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nKate, are you talking about the congestion at the West Coast ports?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kate McShane (Analysts)】\nI'm sorry, no, more of a longer-term strategy. I think a couple of retailers have indicated that they're looking for more freshness in the market. As you see a lot more speed to market from other manufacturers, I wondered if that was something that NIKE talked about and if there was any opportunity within the supply chain to address that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nWell, absolutely, Kate. We have made a number of different investments over time. And we continue to do that both in terms of how we operate our supply chain and more closely tied the timing of production and shipping all the way through to the final consumer, so certainly on that front. We've also, as you know, done a lot of work in the innovation space around how we manufacture product and how we design and develop it. For example, on the NFL, we've had to do some very different approaches to make sure that we're able to respond very quickly to changes in demand, whether it be for specific teams or specific athletes. And that goes all the way to the manufacturing revolution type of investments we've made around technologies like Flyknit. So we are putting a lot of money and a lot of resources against how our supply chain evolves to increase speed and make sure we deliver to consumers as quickly and as innovatively as we can.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Boss (Analysts)】\nGreat quarter. So there's a lot of talk about Flyknit marquee basketball price points. But can you touch on the mid-tier channel, the segmentation strategy you guys have, particularly any product innovation for us to watch and just kind of how you think about pricing power in that channel?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nYes, it's -- obviously, we continue to make sure that we continue to focus our pricing strategy, certainly, around ensuring that we give great value to our consumers. So it's always a balance of price to value with the consumer. Our ability to bring new innovation allows us the ability to command certainly a premium price. And certainly, our brand strength does that, too. So obviously, one area that we talked about, which was the -- in the Running business, we talked certainly about the core and our ability to make sure we continue to stay focused on bringing more innovation there. Our Basketball business is very strong at the moment. And we feel it will continue to be strong because we have an incredible pipeline of new innovations that we keep bringing into the marketplace. So obviously, as you saw when we brought the Kyrie Irving -- the KYRIE shoe into the marketplace, we're just seeing tremendous response to those products. So we continue to feel, again, very confident about our ability to keep the excitement in the Basketball category while continuing to serve all the various segments, whether you're coming through the House of Hoops like at Foot Locker or you work in certainly more of a mid-tier account.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nYes, I just want to quickly add that our innovation agenda is really about bringing a complete offense, which means across the categories, across the product types and up and down the price point spectrum. So that's really important to us. We have a major focus on elevating the state of innovation in our core product, and I think you'll see that coming through the pipeline here in the quarters ahead; very excited about that part of NIKE. But certainly, innovation is not reserved for the upper price point premium product. It runs up and down the price spectrum, and that's a very, very important part of our growth strategy going forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Boss (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then so we've seen a clear top line and bottom line inflection really over the last 12 to 18 months. Mark, I'm curious when you take a step back, what do you think's been the largest enabler in the organization here as we've seen this inflection? And as we think about the category offense, what do you think -- what's the best way to think about the potential next leg of opportunity?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nIn terms of the category offense?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Boss (Analysts)】\nYes, I mean, just largely, I'd be curious as you think about what's really changed in the organization to drive both the top and bottom line inflection that we've seen over really the last year to 2 years here.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nWell, the category offense, just touching on that for a second, is really driving deeper insights into the marketplace, which really, as you know, drive the innovation, which creates the product, which drives growth for us. And it's not just the product innovation. It's also the insights in the consumer and consumer cultures, making sure the brand is resonating, we're relevant, we're connected. I think it's not so much a difference from where we've been. We're refining our ability to be highly creative and innovative but also really disciplined and operating in a much higher level across the various dimensions of the business. We have a management team here that is very much aligned, very experienced. We never take our success for granted. We're always looking for ways that we can improve, which is really important to me and I think NIKE's success to date. But we are probably our own biggest critic. But I think our ability to innovate and our ability to drive operational excellence at the same time is just -- it's never been at the level it is today, and I'm actually quite proud of that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Omar Saad (Analysts)】\nI actually wanted to ask my first question about the manufacturing revolution in the context of currency. They have been -- you and the industry largely have been producing in Asia and markets where the currencies are tied to the dollar, and the dollar, as you said, has seeing unprecedented strength against all other major currencies. Is now the time to kind of accelerate the process of maybe pulling manufacturing out of some of these markets and taking manufacturing to the end markets and using some of the automated technologies to allow yourself to produce in markets -- in the end markets where the costs will be aligned, at least from a currency perspective, where the sales are? Just your thoughts around that, if this changes the equation there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nWell, one of the things that I made a reference to this in the prepared remarks, Omar, is that when we implemented our trading company 4 or 5 years ago, one of the things that we did is we started deconstructing our payments to the factories into a basket of currencies as opposed to 1 currency, which lets us get natural offsets to some of the currency exposures. So we're getting some of the benefit that you're talking about here of matching sourcing currencies and selling currencies even within our existing structure. The second thing is that we've adjusted -- or we do adjust payments to the factories on the basis of how those currencies move. So we are getting some offsetting sourcing benefits right now from the fact that currencies in a lot of our sourcing countries are weakening. So that helps us also net down our foreign exchange exposure. With respect to your overall premise of trying to make sure that our manufacturing is closer both in proximity and time to where the product is sold, that is absolutely part of the strategy from a consumer standpoint. So I think when you look at the financial side of it, we're getting some of the benefits that you're describing through the way we've set up our trading company. And that's not stopping us from keeping the pedal down on driving manufacturing revolution because we think there's a huge consumer benefit to doing that as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nWe definitely see the opportunity. The innovation agenda is really helping to create some efficiencies and opportunity to automate the manufacturing process, which ultimately will allow us to source more broadly down the road. And as Don said, that's a big part of our agenda.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Omar Saad (Analysts)】\nThat's really helpful. And then a follow-up. Don, as you head into retirement, there's a lot of complex things going on in the global markets and currencies and the trading company that you set up. Mark also, how do you feel about the transition? Can you talk a little bit about the transition? Don's been there a really long time, obviously knows the business extremely well. Can you help us understand why we shouldn't be concerned about the transition going on in the CFO position?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nWell, let me take the first cut at that. First of all, rumors of my departure are premature here because I will still be in this role through the end of July. So you're not quite rid of me yet. I am tremendously excited about the next chapter in my life, but I'm also extraordinarily excited about the prospects for NIKE and have tremendous confidence in both the management team as well as my successor, Andy Campion. Certainly, Mark can speak for himself on that. But you're not quite rid of me yet, and I feel real excited about it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nWell, since you brought it up, I'll just say that Don's impact here has been absolutely tremendous through the years. I personally have nothing but incredible respect for Don and the impact that he's made at NIKE. I wasn't going to go here. It's a little premature, as Don said. But I will say that I'm also incredibly confident in Don's successor early into fiscal '16. Andy Campion has -- is really a seasoned NIKE veteran, and he's been under the tutelage of Don and the incredible financial leadership team here at NIKE. And I have tremendous confidence in Andy's ability to take the reins and continue the momentum that Don's helped create for us going forward. More on that as we move forward.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Omar Saad (Analysts)】\nDon, congratulations on your retirement.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nThanks, Omar.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nSo my 2 questions. First, Trevor, you mentioned in your comments the core footwear in Running in North America not performing quite as well as you guys would like. I was wondering if you might share with us sort of more what is going on there. Is it a fashion shift? Is this a product presentation? Or what are some of the things that we should be looking for that could get that going again? And then the second question is just as you look over the next year or so in Europe, the sort of need and ability to raise prices over there to offset all the FX changes and how you guys are thinking about that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nOkay. Certainly, Robby. The -- I think the first thing I want to just maybe communicate is that Running -- our brand continues to really resonate with runners in North America. And one of the things I want to do is maybe unpack a little bit about how we view the business. And we always talk about what we say is the amplified offense, which really gives you a greater view of the marketplace. And so when you take a look at it, you have the performance segment, you have the core segment, and you have the Running-inspired segment. And so if you break those down, in the performance segment, we're seeing tremendous success of the new parts that we've been bringing to marketplace. So we -- whether you take the Air Pegasus 31 or the Max 2015 or any of those products, they're doing really, really well. And so we feel obviously very, very confident about that. As I mentioned, in the core footwear, we think there's opportunity for us to do better in that zone. And so as Mark said, we're going to continue to bring more innovation and strengthen that part of the business. The other dimension is the Running-inspired business, which I mentioned, which are things like the Roshe, which really speak to more the aesthetic side or certainly people who like the aesthetic for the style component of Running. And that's doing really well. So all in all, the Running business core performance is where we see some challenges, but the rest of the business really continues to do really well. In addition, the apparel is also doing really, really well in the marketplace. So we feel we're connected with runners in a great way. Lastly, I would say that I'm very confident about the innovations we're going to continue to bring in the marketplace over the next 18 months. We have a robust pipeline. So I'm really excited about doing that and making sure that we continue. Futures are actually up 15%. So we feel confident about the Running business and its impact in the marketplace.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nRobby, just to clarify, futures are up 15% for North America. Futures are also strong in both footwear and apparel for the total Running category globally.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nAnd to your second question -- go ahead, Robby.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nYes. Back to Europe. Yes, yes Europe, just pricing increases and how much of that is maybe, Don, in some of the guidance, the preliminary guidance you gave us.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nYes, just the first piece would be the way we approach these things, which is when we think about managing the business on a long term and how we move all the levers in the business. So just because the euro has gone down dramatically doesn't mean we're going to try to get all of that back with pricing in Europe. And we're going to pull all the levers to deliver against our goals. We do have in our expectations for FY '16 that we will continue to migrate consumers to premium. We're continuing to manage mix. And if you look at the way our business has performed over the last few years, I think we've been very successful in moving average price points higher, and we would expect to do that. What I wouldn't look for is trying to get all of a very big move in currency back in the near term with huge price increases in any one piece of geography. We play for the long term.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Drbul (Analysts)】\nDon, congratulations. Best of luck.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nThank you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Drbul (Analysts)】\nAnd maybe I guess the 2 questions that I have, the first one is with the U.S. business like with some of the challenges, I think you called out the Running pieces of it. But would you attribute any of the challenges in the U.S. business this quarter to cannibalization or potential cannibalization given the big increase that you've generated on the Direct-to-Consumer piece?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nNo, I wouldn't. I said that we continue to see great momentum in North America. And as I mentioned earlier, the 15% futures growth continues to give us confidence about the business in North America. Obviously, we do have -- our DTC business is growing, but we're also growing very well and we have a great relationship with our wholesale partners. So we feel very confident about the way the business is growing and how the brand continues to resonate with consumer. The demand for the brand is really high in North America and actually around the world.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Drbul (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then a question on the futures with the reported period. Can you just talk about like the first half of the order period versus the second half? And was it stronger in the second half or in the first half? Like how can we think about that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nFutures are a little stronger in the second half of the window.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Drbul (Analysts)】\nGot it, okay. And then just the last question is what do you guys have the -- at UAB in your brackets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Parker (Executives)】\nNot going to go there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lindsay Mann (Analysts)】\nI wanted to ask about your women's apparel or just the women's business in North America. You've had a couple of very high-profile initiatives, some shifts on sponsorship and marketing. And then also, we've seen a number of the Training Club shop-in-shops in Macy's. Can you give us an update on your progress in women's apparel and maybe some of the specific things you have in the pipeline for the next few quarters?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nOkay, yes. Our women's business, I'm obviously very excited about the progress in our women's business. Our women's business really across not only North America, but really around the world, continues to grow at a really rapid pace. In fact, it's outpacing our men's business. And our strategy to really focus on the run, train and live component of the business, every dimension is actually growing, both footwear and apparel. As well as some of the things that we've done certainly around the community work with the services that we're providing, they're also doing really well. So it really is a case of every dimension of this is actually working really well. So we're really excited. Some of the things to really point to, whether it's the Epic Lux Tights, the bras that we've just recently launched, some of the great footwear, all of those things are doing really, really well both in our doors, in dotcom as well as with our wholesale partners. So we feel really, really pleased about the progress.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lindsay Mann (Analysts)】\nGreat. And just a quick maybe housekeeping item. I'm sorry if you answered this already. But beyond the port delays, were there any other factors that drove the disconnect between your North America sales versus what futures orders suggested they might be in the quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nYes, we also had some weather-related delays in the South. There were some ice storms down there. So we lost some shipping and so on. So there's quite a bit of supply chain noise in Q3, which, as we said in the prepared remarks, we do expect that's going to sort out over the next few quarters. But as Trevor said, demand extraordinarily strong in North America, futures up 15%, so feeling really good about the underlying strength of the business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jim Duffy (Analysts)】\nFirst, Don, congratulations on the well-deserved pending retirement.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nThank you, Jim.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jim Duffy (Analysts)】\nA couple other questions. E-commerce growth has been a standout. I know it's also been also a big area for investment. As we look into fiscal '16, is that business at a point where we can lever some of those investments? Or do you expect the investments there to continue to drag on the profitability?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Donald Blair (Executives)】\nWell, first thing I would say is the profitability is growing faster than the revenue. So we're continuing to drive both top line and bottom line on e-commerce. So number one is this has been a winner both from a growth and a profitability standpoint. The second thing is we are going to continue to invest in digital. We believe that's where the consumer is and is going. And that's where our brand is and is going, and so we're going to continue to invest there. But from an economic standpoint, it's been a very positive driver for business, both top and bottom line.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jim Duffy (Analysts)】\nGreat to hear. And then next question on China. Sales turning nicely, but the profit growth in the quarter lagged. Is that simply a function of timing of investments? Or is there some broader influence of the repositioning in the market?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Trevor Edwards (Executives)】\nNo, I really -- I think from the China perspective, obviously, we're very pleased with the continued growth. No, none of the -- it's probably more just at this point in time, but I would -- it's not something that we would envision over the long term.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kelley Hall (Executives)】\nWell, thank you, everyone, for joining us, and we'll look forward to talking to you on our Q4 call.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Executive Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.\r\nAs a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.\r\nBefore taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks, and with that, I'll turn the call over to Safra.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3. I'll then review guidance for Q4 and then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.\r\nAs you can imagine, we are very, very pleased with our results as Software and Cloud, Cloud SaaS and PaaS, total hardware, total revenue and earnings per share were all above the midpoint of my CD guidance. As you probably remember, I didn't provide U.S. dollar guidance for Q3 given the unusually high volatility in exchange rates. The currency headwind ended up being 6% for Software and Cloud revenue as well as total revenue, 7% for total hardware revenue and $0.06 a share -- and $0.06 for earnings per share. Currencies continue to move significantly, so my comments today generally reflect constant dollar growth rates, which is how we look at the business.\r\nCloud SaaS and PaaS revenue was $375 million, up 33% from last year. Bookings were again over 100%, adding to the momentum, which is helping drive SaaS, PaaS revenue growth. Now when bookings turn into revenue depends on many factors, but one thing is clear. Our momentum in cloud bodes very, very well for the future. Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service revenue was $155 million, up 32%. Overall, our cloud results were much, much better than expected as we're clearly growing faster than Salesforce. We're more than 3x the size of Workday now.\r\nSoftware and Cloud revenues were $7.2 billion, up 7% from last year. Software updates and product support revenues drove nearly half of total company revenue at $4.7 billion, up 8% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels as our growing installed base of customers continues to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenue was $2 billion, while we continue to enable our customers with their ongoing transition to cloud.\r\nLooking at GAAP Software and Cloud results by region. The Americas grew 7%. EMEA grew 9%, and Asia Pacific grew 4%. Total hardware, including hardware support, grew 5% with hardware system product revenue of $712 million and hardware support revenue of $587 million. Engineered Systems saw double-digit revenue growth on the strength of our product portfolio. Obviously, we continue to gain share against IBM and HP, whose high-end server businesses continue their decline.\r\nFor the company, total revenue for the quarter was $9.3 billion, up 6% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.2 billion, up 4% from last year. And the operating margin was 46% in constant currency. That we're able to maintain our industry-leading operating margins while growing our cloud business more than 30% is a testimony to the strength of our business model.\r\nThe non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22.7%, and EPS was $0.68 in U.S. dollars, growing 9% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 20.8%, and GAAP EPS was $0.56 in U.S. dollars. As I mentioned earlier, but for the currency move, EPS would have been $0.06 higher.\r\nFree cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.5 billion. Capital expenditures continue to be a bit higher as we provision cloud orders and build out for the enormous fourth quarter SaaS and PaaS growth we anticipate. Just to put it into perspective, when you compare the same 9 months last year to the 9 months -- the first 9 months of the year this year, our capital expenditure is up about $350 million. That's all.\r\nWe now have over $43 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $11.5 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $6.4 billion, down slightly due to currency, but in constant dollars, it actually grew 6%. Within short-term deferred revenue is $321 million for SaaS, PaaS and IaaS cloud services. As we said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right valuation as both are critically important.\r\nThis quarter, we repurchased 46.1 million shares for a total of $2.1 billion -- $2 billion, excuse me. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased nearly 200 million shares for a total of $8.1 billion, and we've paid out dividends of $2.1 billion for a total that is more than 75% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 25% today from 12% -- from $0.12 to $0.15 per share.\r\nNow to the guidance. First of all, given the continued high volatility in exchange rates, we expect currency will affect results. But as we just don't know how much, I'm going to again provide constant currency guidance only. Secondly, our customers are clearly embracing Oracle PaaS faster than we expected, which is actually great for us. Just to give you a little bit of insight on how we look at the business. For every $1 million of license we sell, we expect to collect another $1 million from support over 5 years for a total of $2 million. While for every $1 million of PaaS we sell, we actually expect to collect $5 million over 5 years. That's what we're looking at in our business, and though it may have some short-term effect, it's actually already showing up in the revenues.\r\nSo here we go. SaaS and PaaS on a non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 26% to 30%. On a GAAP basis, SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 27% to 31%. Cloud IaaS on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 29% to 33%. Software and Cloud revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, including SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, new software license and software support, is expected to grow 2% to 6%. Hardware systems revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, which includes hardware system products and hardware system support, is expected to be between negative 2% and positive 8%. Total revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 1% to 6%.\r\nNon-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.90 and $0.96 in constant currency. GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.76 and $0.82 in constant currency. And again, all of my guidance today is in constant currency and assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 24% and a GAAP tax rate of 23%. Of course, it may end up being different, but that's what we've got in our model right now.\r\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Safra. As usual, I'll try to give you some numbers behind the numbers. I think, overall, a very solid quarter for Oracle and a great cloud quarter for Oracle.\r\nAs Safra did, I'll give you numbers in CD. SaaS, PaaS revenue grew 33%. Bookings ARR grew 130%, double last year and up double digits sequentially. Fusion bookings, ERP, HCM and SFA all grew triple digits. Fusion bookings have grown more than 200% every quarter this year.\r\nWe added 800 brand new SaaS customers -- nearly 800. Nearly 530 existing customers expanded their cloud services in the quarter; in HCM, 220 new customers; in Customer Experience, 470 new customers; in ERP, 160 new customers. ERP SaaS installed base is multiples the size of Workday. We're adding customers at more than 10x the rate of Workday. Less than 25% of our ERP SaaS wins involve any on-premise Oracle ERP customer, meaning that over 75% are net new to Oracle. I would give you a stat on SAP, but we never see them in cloud ERP.\r\nPaaS, more than 400 new PaaS customers in the quarter. Bookings up 200% sequentially. Q4 in PaaS is going to be very big. Premise software grew 6%. We expect continued growth. Engineered Systems grew 15% in the quarter. We sold more than 1,000 systems, including over 500 Exadata units booked. Given competitor results, we're taking huge market share. Oracle will be the leader in high-end servers this year.\r\nIn wrapping up, our cloud revenue is already above a $2 billion run rate. Our SaaS, PaaS pipeline is already large and growing rapidly, and it's growing faster than what you're seeing in the bookings -- that being the pipeline. We now expect Q4 bookings up $300 million, $50 million higher than before. We also expect FY '15 bookings growth to be greater than 100%. And you probably remember when Larry actually gave 50% growth in bookings as guidance at a financial analyst meeting, and we're going to double that number. Clearly, the migration to cloud is happening faster than we expected, and to Safra's point, that's great news for Oracle, great news for our customers and great news for our investors.\r\nAnd with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Larry.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Mark. This quarter, Oracle sold cloud ERP systems to 160 [ph] new customers. That's more ERP customers than Workday has acquired in all the years they've been in the cloud business. Not 1 of our 160 [ph] cloud ERP deals was competitive with SAP. As Mark said, we just don't see them in the market. By the end of this quarter, Oracle will have sold over 1,000 cloud ERP systems. We are on our way to building the largest ERP business in the cloud.\r\nOracle now has a cloud revenue run rate of well over $2 billion a year. We're already the world's second largest SaaS and PaaS company. On our last quarterly conference call, I predicted that in our fiscal year 2016 Oracle would likely sell more SaaS and PaaS new business than Salesforce.com. Well, I was way too cautious.\r\nSorry, I'm just checking my notes here. Did I lose the call for a second?\n\n---\n\nNo, no, we're here.\n\n---\n\nYou're good.\n\n---\n\nOkay, then, let me just back up 1 second. I think this is important. On our last quarterly conference call, I predicted that in our fiscal year 2016 Oracle would likely sell more SaaS and PaaS new business than Salesforce.com. I was way too cautious and conservative. Our cloud business is growing a lot faster than even I expected. Our cloud bookings are now growing at over 100% per year, so I'd like to revise my prediction.\r\nI now believe that Oracle will sell more new SaaS and PaaS business than Salesforce.com in this current calendar year 2015. It's going to be close, but I think we're going to sell more in the cloud than they do this year. I suspect that might come as a big surprise to a lot of people out there. You won't have to wait very long to find out who's going to win this.\r\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to the operator.\n\n---\n\nOperator, we'll go ahead and begin the Q&A portion of the call now please.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Ken Bond (Executives)】\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Executive Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.\r\nAs a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.\r\nBefore taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks, and with that, I'll turn the call over to Safra.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nThanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3. I'll then review guidance for Q4 and then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.\r\nAs you can imagine, we are very, very pleased with our results as Software and Cloud, Cloud SaaS and PaaS, total hardware, total revenue and earnings per share were all above the midpoint of my CD guidance. As you probably remember, I didn't provide U.S. dollar guidance for Q3 given the unusually high volatility in exchange rates. The currency headwind ended up being 6% for Software and Cloud revenue as well as total revenue, 7% for total hardware revenue and $0.06 a share -- and $0.06 for earnings per share. Currencies continue to move significantly, so my comments today generally reflect constant dollar growth rates, which is how we look at the business.\r\nCloud SaaS and PaaS revenue was $375 million, up 33% from last year. Bookings were again over 100%, adding to the momentum, which is helping drive SaaS, PaaS revenue growth. Now when bookings turn into revenue depends on many factors, but one thing is clear. Our momentum in cloud bodes very, very well for the future. Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service revenue was $155 million, up 32%. Overall, our cloud results were much, much better than expected as we're clearly growing faster than Salesforce. We're more than 3x the size of Workday now.\r\nSoftware and Cloud revenues were $7.2 billion, up 7% from last year. Software updates and product support revenues drove nearly half of total company revenue at $4.7 billion, up 8% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels as our growing installed base of customers continues to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenue was $2 billion, while we continue to enable our customers with their ongoing transition to cloud.\r\nLooking at GAAP Software and Cloud results by region. The Americas grew 7%. EMEA grew 9%, and Asia Pacific grew 4%. Total hardware, including hardware support, grew 5% with hardware system product revenue of $712 million and hardware support revenue of $587 million. Engineered Systems saw double-digit revenue growth on the strength of our product portfolio. Obviously, we continue to gain share against IBM and HP, whose high-end server businesses continue their decline.\r\nFor the company, total revenue for the quarter was $9.3 billion, up 6% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.2 billion, up 4% from last year. And the operating margin was 46% in constant currency. That we're able to maintain our industry-leading operating margins while growing our cloud business more than 30% is a testimony to the strength of our business model.\r\nThe non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22.7%, and EPS was $0.68 in U.S. dollars, growing 9% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 20.8%, and GAAP EPS was $0.56 in U.S. dollars. As I mentioned earlier, but for the currency move, EPS would have been $0.06 higher.\r\nFree cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.5 billion. Capital expenditures continue to be a bit higher as we provision cloud orders and build out for the enormous fourth quarter SaaS and PaaS growth we anticipate. Just to put it into perspective, when you compare the same 9 months last year to the 9 months -- the first 9 months of the year this year, our capital expenditure is up about $350 million. That's all.\r\nWe now have over $43 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $11.5 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $6.4 billion, down slightly due to currency, but in constant dollars, it actually grew 6%. Within short-term deferred revenue is $321 million for SaaS, PaaS and IaaS cloud services. As we said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right valuation as both are critically important.\r\nThis quarter, we repurchased 46.1 million shares for a total of $2.1 billion -- $2 billion, excuse me. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased nearly 200 million shares for a total of $8.1 billion, and we've paid out dividends of $2.1 billion for a total that is more than 75% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 25% today from 12% -- from $0.12 to $0.15 per share.\r\nNow to the guidance. First of all, given the continued high volatility in exchange rates, we expect currency will affect results. But as we just don't know how much, I'm going to again provide constant currency guidance only. Secondly, our customers are clearly embracing Oracle PaaS faster than we expected, which is actually great for us. Just to give you a little bit of insight on how we look at the business. For every $1 million of license we sell, we expect to collect another $1 million from support over 5 years for a total of $2 million. While for every $1 million of PaaS we sell, we actually expect to collect $5 million over 5 years. That's what we're looking at in our business, and though it may have some short-term effect, it's actually already showing up in the revenues.\r\nSo here we go. SaaS and PaaS on a non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 26% to 30%. On a GAAP basis, SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 27% to 31%. Cloud IaaS on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 29% to 33%. Software and Cloud revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, including SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, new software license and software support, is expected to grow 2% to 6%. Hardware systems revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, which includes hardware system products and hardware system support, is expected to be between negative 2% and positive 8%. Total revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 1% to 6%.\r\nNon-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.90 and $0.96 in constant currency. GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.76 and $0.82 in constant currency. And again, all of my guidance today is in constant currency and assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 24% and a GAAP tax rate of 23%. Of course, it may end up being different, but that's what we've got in our model right now.\r\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nThanks, Safra.

      "transcript_text3": "I actually wanted to ask Larry a couple of questions about the Database business. First up, Larry, I would love if we could get a little bit of insight on 12c adoption. Second thing is would like to talk a little bit about some of the use cases driving the PaaS growth. And if I -- if you can indulge me, maybe the last question is I'd be remiss not to ask for a competitive assessment of S4/HANA from SAP.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Well, let's start with 12c adoption rates. The most important new feature we probably put in the database and sometimes in terms of customer enthusiasm is our in-memory database feature. And that along with a multi-tenancy feature are the 2 pieces that are really driving 12c adoption to higher rates than anything we've seen in about -- for a very, very long time. So I think people are moving very quickly. Again, it takes years for people to move to the next version of the database. People are very cautious, but they're moving more quickly than historical precedent to adopt 12c for 2 big reasons: One is multitenancy, and the other is our in-memory database option. So that's going exceptionally well. The use cases that are spurring adoption of the Oracle Database in the cloud is the very simple fact you can take any workload, any database that you currently have running in your data center and move your database with a push of a button and move your application with a push of a button and run it in the Oracle cloud. Nobody else can do that. If you look at the other PaaS vendors, well, the second-biggest PaaS vendor -- well, actually, maybe their the biggest PaaS vendor still, where they don't -- I'm not sure they break out their number. Salesforce.com PaaS is based on proprietary technology that allows you to extend Salesforce.com applications. Our PaaS, our Platform as a Service is based on 2 products: Java, the world's most popular programming language and an industry standard; and the Oracle Database, the world's most popular relational database and an industry standard. We have enormous on-premise usage of Java and the Oracle Database. And now people can -- don't have to decide where they're going to run things. They can do test and development in the Oracle cloud and run production in on-premise, and then they can decide, if they need more capacity, they can go from on-premise into the cloud and back to on-premise. We're the only ones that allows you to move data and workload back and forth between the cloud and on-premise. That's the primary use case, we think, that's going to drive Oracle PaaS to be the #1 PaaS in the cloud very, very quickly. The other -- the third question is S4/HANA and the cloud. Well, very simply, I mean, I talk to a lot of people at SAP actually about S4/HANA in the cloud and people who'd recently been at SAP. And you've got to understand one thing. This is the same old SAP. This is all written in ABAP. There's 30-year-old code in S4 business suite. There's nothing new about this. They're simply hosting it on someone else's computer. I also can't find the website where you log on and try it. Everyone else lets you log on. You go to a website. If you want to buy our stuff, you want to buy SaaS, you want to buy PaaS, you go to a website. You get provisioned, and you go. Not so with SAP. This is 30-year-old code renamed S4/HANA. Now they did add a new user interface called Fiori to the old code, but that's all they did. They did add another database that they support. They now support -- in addition to Oracle and Sybase and IBM DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server, they also support HANA. That's it. They've added one new database. They've added a more modern UI. All the old code in the middle is written in ABAP. Ask them. It's written in ABAP. It's 30 years old. We don't see them as a cloud competitor. We actually almost never talk about them except when we get a question on the call. That's it.\n\n---\n\nI actually had 2 of them. I wanted to know if you at all could discuss -- I know you mentioned it a little bit, but go into a little bit more detail about how you're seeing the competitive environment changing versus Salesforce.com and Workday, kind of what you've noticed over the last even 3 to 6 months. And then Safra, I might have missed it. I apologize. But could you talk about your support growth in constant currency please? I think I might have missed the number.\n\n---\n\nSure. How about Mark, you do the...\n\n---\n\nSure, I'll start on the competitive environment. I would say that the competitive environment with Workday is different in HR than in ERP/EPM. In ERP/EPM, our position is extremely strong. I would not call Workday competitive in that market at all, so let's put that aside. In the context of HCM, I think with each subsequent release of HCM, whether it had been Release 7, Release 8, Release 9 and now Release 10, we have simply engineered now a better product than Workday. And so I think from an HCM perspective, head-to-head there in the United States, some strong fights. I think as our awareness, the education of our sales force, and our references have gotten better. We now win more than half the deals in the United States. Outside the United States, our win rate goes up actually exponentially because of the breadth of our distribution in those markets. So that's sort of how I would characterize Workday. Also, any deal that comes up that's multi-pillar, so in many cases, you wind up with an ERP competitive environment that then actually many times can drag an HR, so we think competitively, Heather, the fact that we have ERP and EPM in the cloud, in SaaS with a strong lead also benefits our HCM business as well. So out engineering, out distributed in almost all the world. As I described, big lead in ERP/EPM, where I would not describe Workday as extremely competitive. Salesforce, I think perhaps different. Salesforce is clearly the incumbent in most accounts, not Oracle. We're, frankly, the guy coming up with a challenger capability, and we now bring a suite of capability with marketing in addition to sales automation. And we do a lot of things that they don't do. We really come to the customer with a different approach. As opposed to trying to help the customer basically report what the sales force is bidding on. We actually come to market trying to help the sales force, meaning our customers' sales forces, sell more stuff all the way from automating a marketing campaign to the actual process by which they communicate to the customer, get information about the customer and actually go through a whole engineering and selling process with the customer. And this is proven. You've heard it with our numbers. Our sales automation solutions in the quarter were superb. Marketing had a fantastic quarter. We are the leader in marketing. We are challenging very aggressively in sales automation, and we expect to give them a run for their money in every sales automation deal in the planet. But our differentiation, Heather, comes from bringing a suite of capability to help the sales -- or our customer's sales organization sell.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And Heather, as far as sequential growth in support -- in constant currency, it's up sequentially between 1% and 2%. The only change you see in the tables is as a result of currency, so sequentially up in software license updates and product support.\n\n---\n\nJust one quick question, Safra. Can you give us a sense of what the FX impact was on cash flow in the quarter?\n\n---\n\nSo about -- it was -- well, about half of the decline in cash flow, a little bit more, I think, was actually entirely currency, and a little of it, frankly, was tax payments that under circumstances in some jurisdictions where you pay and then you discuss it. And then a little of it actually ended up being in an inventory buildup that we're doing right now, about $100 million of inventory buildup in preparation for all of the engineered systems that go out in Q4. So we do the buildup of the pieces in Q3. So I'd say -- I know you asked about currency, but currency is about half of it.\n\n---\n\nMark, could you talk about the Engineered Systems business? Certainly, growth of 15% is outpacing the market, but how is the split of business between the Quarter Rack, Half Rack, Full Rack or if you want to look at it based on the products, Exadata, Exalogic, Exalytics? How is that shaping out? What do you think the mix shift in this business is going to look like the next 12 months or so? What I'm really trying to get an angle on is can the business get better as a result of greater 12c adoption as well.\n\n---\n\nYes. So let me -- there's a lot of questions tied up there, so let me try to hit as many as I can. First, I think, to your point, when you look at our competitive results in high-end servers, we're gaining a ton of share. So just to make sure, you said growing a bit faster. All of our competitors, really, in this space are highly negative, and as we've talked about, growth was 15% in the quarter. It is spread between a solid -- I would say, a solid Exadata quarter all the way around. We grew in Exadata, and this is going against, I know you know this, Kash, fairly tough comparisons with the success of Exadata last year. But we had very strong performance on some of our new engineered systems, so it was pretty well dispersed. We had strong growth in SuperCluster in the quarter. We had strong growth in our Oracle Database Appliance. We had good growth in our Big Data Appliance, which is our Hadoop Oracle appliance that we brought to market. Our Zero Data, one of my favorite named products that we have in the company, the Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance, contributed growth in the quarter. So the suite of products that we brought to market in Engineered Systems as a group had a really strong quarter. And while some of the numbers are small coming off of a baseline, they all contributed, and they were all growing. And in an aggregate, we grew 15%. So I think our pipelines are up overall, and so we feel great about the quarter Engineered Systems delivered and great about our pipeline.\n\n---\n\nAnd the hardware refresh as it relates to 12c mainstream adoption, could you get a benefit there?\n\n---\n\nYes, I mean, I think, listen, we've seen a strong uptake of -- well, let me say it another way. The beginnings of the uptake of 12c, I believe that also helps, and it also helps in the context of what we see as 12c and the emergence of private clouds that exist in -- within our customers, where you see many of these architectural moves to these engineered systems as well.\n\n---\n\nSo Larry, 2 questions. First is, we talk to companies that are native to the SaaS market, they indicate that they'll continue to win business because they have an inherent advantage being natively built for the cloud with ease of implementation and ease of use, and I wondered if you could comment on how you think you stack up now and future releases of Fusion if there's more to be done on that front. And then secondly, you talked about in-memory and 12.1c...\n\n---\n\nRick, can I interrupt you right -- on that one. Was the question, some people are SaaS -- people are saying SAP was natively built for the cloud?\n\n---\n\nNo, no, these are the native SaaS companies I'm talking about [indiscernible] ...\n\n---\n\nOh, the native SaaS companies. Okay, I misunderstood. Okay, got it. Okay.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Well, let me just answer the first part of your question now. We made a big announcement almost 10 years ago that we're rebuilding all of our applications for the cloud. Now it wasn't called the cloud 10 years ago. It was called SaaS. But we said that we're rebuilding everything and the thing called Fusion network, going to rebuild our middleware for the cloud, build our applications on top of our cloud middleware and change our database for the cloud, make it multitenant, make it in-memory, do all of those things. We started a project 10 years ago to rewrite everything. When -- Fusion ERP, every single line of code is brand new. Fusion HCM, every single line of the code is brand new. I can go on and on with all of these -- we -- they're completely rewritten for the cloud as is our -- and our database was not completely rewritten. We added specific features to the database to make it work properly in the cloud, the most prominent of which is the multitenancy feature. We think we put multitenancy at the right level of the stack in the database, rather than multitenancy in the application which creates real security problems, which I'm not going to go into. But we think we have a huge advantage over these -- someone like Workday that doesn't have a database. They built -- Workday kind of built their own little database, and that's what you're buying into when you buy Workday. We built our own little database. It's called Oracle. Workday has its own programming technology. We use this programming technology called Java. So -- we -- and we built everything, everything from scratch. I'm telling you, every single line of code in Fusion HCM is new for the cloud. Every single line of code for Fusion ERP is new for the cloud, and those new cloud applications are based on, by far, the strongest platform. Workday doesn't even have a platform that they sell. They have no platform. They have a platform that they kind of use internally. Salesforce has a platform that we also think is not competitive with our platform. So you're going have to be very specific as what advantages these small companies think they have over us in the cloud when we have, I think, very clearly the strongest platform based on industry standards and years and years of experience. We've adapted that for the cloud. Give you an example how strong our cloud platform is, Salesforce.com uses our cloud platform. Netflix uses our cloud platform. In fact, every single cloud company of size, the top 10, 9 of them use our database in the cloud. Workday is the only one that doesn't. But tell me again the advantages they think they have.\n\n---\n\nYes, ease of implementation and ease of use.\n\n---\n\nI don't -- easy to implement, it's easy to say, but we're getting our ERP customers -- can you tell me ease of implementation of what. And we think our cloud ERP is very -- is the best of breed in cloud ERP. We think our cloud HCM is now the best of breed in cloud HCM in the areas of user interface, which is usually what the people mean by ease of use, better adaptive technology, which makes the implementation very, very -- we have very rapid implementations, very low-cost implementations, we think, are competitive with anyone out there. In fact, one of the reasons why our consulting business keeps getting smaller is because our applications implementations take so much less time and effort.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Larry, the second question was with the in-memory capabilities, do you think it's possible that we see a lot more innovation in terms of the type of business processes that we can automate with this next generation of apps in the cloud?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think a lot of things that used to take a long time will take less time. So manufacturers will run MRP much faster than they used to. People that used to get reports overnight will get those reports instantaneously, so they'll have access to more information. I think there will be -- there are some very interesting applications in terms of security for immediate detection of intrusion. Being able to analyze the data so quickly, we actually can do a better job in security. That's one of the big things that we've been working on for some time. I think there are a lot of existing applications that you used to wait overnight for. You'll get that data instantaneously, and then there'll be a host of new applications. But how revolutionary that will be, I think this is going to happen. People will discover these new applications over a fairly long period of time. So as excited as we are about in-memory databases and -- oh, and by -- and we have by far the fastest in-memory database in the world. But again, the first benefit is to make the existing apps run much faster. The second benefit -- and that will happen right away. The second benefit will trickle in over years as people -- as smart people discover new ways to build applications they never thought -- that were -- just weren't possible before the in-memory database.\n\n---\n\nMark, just 2 quick questions. First, I wanted to follow up on your earlier comments regarding the Customer Experience Pillar. Specifically, can you talk about your position today versus 12 months ago in terms of your visibility with actually with the Chief Marketing Officers? Obviously, you have extremely strong relationships with CIOs, but I'm wondering how your relationships on the marketing side and with the CMOs has changed over the last 12 months. And then secondarily, can you talk about just your industry solution trends and how they're doing and how important having some of that domain expertise is in terms of differentiating you all versus some of your competitors that don't have sort of that deep expertise in certain verticals?\n\n---\n\nSure. In marketing, we've [indiscernible] a significant investment between the acquisitions of Responsys and Eloqua, respectively, where they're leader -- the leader in B2C marketing and B2B marketing. We've added BlueKai. We've added Compendium. We've just added a really nice company in Datalogix and BlueKai, and Datalogix with their data capabilities now differentiate us just not on the marketing automation process and what you do with CMOs and automating that process but also in the underpinning data sets that CMOs get access to. So we have become the biggest and the most popular in the -- in SaaS marketing, and that, frankly, to your point, Kirk, has caused us to now as we've done with our sales forces pointed our -- a sales force directly at a buyer, and that buyer is the CMO, very similar to what we do in HR, where we call on the Head of HR. In marketing, we call on the Head of Marketing. And I think the best testimony to our success and our relationships are our numbers. Our growth in marketing in the quarter was over 200%. And when you look at our competitors, whether those be Adobe, the acquisition that Salesforce.com made, you just see that we are simply growing faster, and we are taking market share in marketing SaaS. So that was -- that's what I would describe in marketing. You had another question. Would you refresh me on what that was?\n\n---\n\nOh, sure. Just your industry solutions, just how they're doing and how important that is in terms of you differentiating yourselves versus competitors.\n\n---\n\nYes. And they had a -- frankly, we've got so much going on in the company. We probably ought to talk about them more. They had a very good quarter in Q3 as they've had over the past several quarters. Obviously, our position in retail was extremely strategic to our customers, and we've now added MICROS, which brought with it a great depth in hospitality and food and beverage. So our retail suite of expertise is now not just in general merchandising but across food and beverage and hospitality as well. We had a very strong quarter in banking, and our expertise now in banking, we've grown our sales force, our ability now to help banks in compliance, in anti-money laundering. Many of the issues that our banking customers are facing today has become a tremendous asset for us. We've had a good quarter, and we continue to have good success in communications. And without going through each one of them, they do give us strong differentiation because when we sell in these industries, we're talking to business buyers, and we're talking to retailers. We're talking to CEOs. We're talking to head of merchandising. And I think next week, Larry and I will be at a -- our conference, our Industry Connect conference, and we'll have roughly 2,000 of our customers there, and they will be business buyers. They will not be what you would think of as typically CIOs. They will be people on the business side, and it gives us a reach into our customers that, frankly, we wouldn't have without the investment we've made in our GBUs.\n\n---\n\nMark, I had 2 quick questions. We've seen 2 quarters in a row of hardware growth in constant currency, and you mentioned double-digit growth in Engineered Systems. But I'm curious on the core M and T server lines in storage and what's happening there and your visibility into the entire hardware bucket growth being sustainable going forward. And then I'd love also your thoughts on large company appetite to move core ERP to the cloud, especially as we think outside of North America in the international sphere.\n\n---\n\nThank you. To your point, Engineered Systems, I already went through it. It is now a significant part of our hardware portfolio and grew 15% and while down is a smaller piece of our hardware portfolio being the M-Series of SPARC. T was down in the quarter, again, all offset by the growth we've seen in Engineered Systems. Storage grew in the quarter. We had significant -- a very strong growth in ZFS, if you will, our network attached storage product. That is not a new story, our ZFS growth, and I predict that will continue as we go forward. We have just released a new SAN product, FS1, that came to us through the Pillar acquisition that our engineering team has done super job for us. And that represents, really, a whole new storage market for us now to go compete head up against EMC. So I believe, going forward, you will see a continuation of storage growth, the continuation of ZFS along with now FS1, a continued growth in Engineered Systems. And we'll continue to push refreshing our SPARC base as we have and as we go forward. As it relates to ERP and you asked specifically about international markets, I mean, just for example, in the quarter, just to give you some flavor for this, we closed ERP SaaS deals at Femsa in Mexico, at Saudi Telecom, at BAE Systems, at Hawaiian Airlines, at KPMG. I mean, these are all certainly very strong brands that are going ERP and ERP and cloud, and at least 75% of what I just named are outside the United States. So we've had very strong -- back to just sort of the cloud context, which probably is at the core of your questions. I think I said a couple of quarters ago, we're just going to get better and better at this. And while the numbers are faster than I predicted and I'm -- I wish I could have predicted them better 2 or 3 quarters ago, our sales force has simply just gotten more productive. They're better educated with better products, and they now have references in virtually every single discipline and pillar that we sell in almost every country that we sell. And so what's happening, it's very interesting. We're getting bigger, and we're growing faster as we're getting bigger. And it's because of a multitude of these issues that I'm describing that have all now tilted our way after, frankly, 2, 2.5 years of hard work of getting our customers, similar to the last question, who now know their functional buyer. They know they the head, the Chief Marketing Officer. They know the Chief Human Resource Officer. Our products have now gotten extremely mature, and we've got references. And I think now that we add PaaS to our cloud offerings -- and I probably should have said this earlier, but I've been doing this a long time, and I've really never seen a pipeline grow as fast as our PaaS pipeline has grown. We really released this at OpenWorld in October and the speed of our pipeline -- you see it just in the conversion to bookings. I actually -- Safra and I get to see it in the benefit of the pipeline, and it is just exciting times for Oracle. Back to Ken.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Mark. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call, and we look forward to speaking to you. Thank you for joining us today. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for closing.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Jason Maynard (Analysts)】\nI actually wanted to ask Larry a couple of questions about the Database business. First up, Larry, I would love if we could get a little bit of insight on 12c adoption. Second thing is would like to talk a little bit about some of the use cases driving the PaaS growth. And if I -- if you can indulge me, maybe the last question is I'd be remiss not to ask for a competitive assessment of S4/HANA from SAP.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nOkay. Well, let's start with 12c adoption rates. The most important new feature we probably put in the database and sometimes in terms of customer enthusiasm is our in-memory database feature. And that along with a multi-tenancy feature are the 2 pieces that are really driving 12c adoption to higher rates than anything we've seen in about -- for a very, very long time. So I think people are moving very quickly. Again, it takes years for people to move to the next version of the database. People are very cautious, but they're moving more quickly than historical precedent to adopt 12c for 2 big reasons: One is multitenancy, and the other is our in-memory database option. So that's going exceptionally well. The use cases that are spurring adoption of the Oracle Database in the cloud is the very simple fact you can take any workload, any database that you currently have running in your data center and move your database with a push of a button and move your application with a push of a button and run it in the Oracle cloud. Nobody else can do that. If you look at the other PaaS vendors, well, the second-biggest PaaS vendor -- well, actually, maybe their the biggest PaaS vendor still, where they don't -- I'm not sure they break out their number. Salesforce.com PaaS is based on proprietary technology that allows you to extend Salesforce.com applications. Our PaaS, our Platform as a Service is based on 2 products: Java, the world's most popular programming language and an industry standard; and the Oracle Database, the world's most popular relational database and an industry standard. We have enormous on-premise usage of Java and the Oracle Database. And now people can -- don't have to decide where they're going to run things. They can do test and development in the Oracle cloud and run production in on-premise, and then they can decide, if they need more capacity, they can go from on-premise into the cloud and back to on-premise. We're the only ones that allows you to move data and workload back and forth between the cloud and on-premise. That's the primary use case, we think, that's going to drive Oracle PaaS to be the #1 PaaS in the cloud very, very quickly. The other -- the third question is S4/HANA and the cloud. Well, very simply, I mean, I talk to a lot of people at SAP actually about S4/HANA in the cloud and people who'd recently been at SAP. And you've got to understand one thing. This is the same old SAP. This is all written in ABAP. There's 30-year-old code in S4 business suite. There's nothing new about this. They're simply hosting it on someone else's computer. I also can't find the website where you log on and try it. Everyone else lets you log on. You go to a website. If you want to buy our stuff, you want to buy SaaS, you want to buy PaaS, you go to a website. You get provisioned, and you go. Not so with SAP. This is 30-year-old code renamed S4/HANA. Now they did add a new user interface called Fiori to the old code, but that's all they did. They did add another database that they support. They now support -- in addition to Oracle and Sybase and IBM DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server, they also support HANA. That's it. They've added one new database. They've added a more modern UI. All the old code in the middle is written in ABAP. Ask them. It's written in ABAP. It's 30 years old. We don't see them as a cloud competitor. We actually almost never talk about them except when we get a question on the call. That's it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Heather Bellini (Analysts)】\nI actually had 2 of them. I wanted to know if you at all could discuss -- I know you mentioned it a little bit, but go into a little bit more detail about how you're seeing the competitive environment changing versus Salesforce.com and Workday, kind of what you've noticed over the last even 3 to 6 months. And then Safra, I might have missed it. I apologize. But could you talk about your support growth in constant currency please? I think I might have missed the number.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nSure. How about Mark, you do the...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nSure, I'll start on the competitive environment. I would say that the competitive environment with Workday is different in HR than in ERP/EPM. In ERP/EPM, our position is extremely strong. I would not call Workday competitive in that market at all, so let's put that aside. In the context of HCM, I think with each subsequent release of HCM, whether it had been Release 7, Release 8, Release 9 and now Release 10, we have simply engineered now a better product than Workday. And so I think from an HCM perspective, head-to-head there in the United States, some strong fights. I think as our awareness, the education of our sales force, and our references have gotten better. We now win more than half the deals in the United States. Outside the United States, our win rate goes up actually exponentially because of the breadth of our distribution in those markets. So that's sort of how I would characterize Workday. Also, any deal that comes up that's multi-pillar, so in many cases, you wind up with an ERP competitive environment that then actually many times can drag an HR, so we think competitively, Heather, the fact that we have ERP and EPM in the cloud, in SaaS with a strong lead also benefits our HCM business as well. So out engineering, out distributed in almost all the world. As I described, big lead in ERP/EPM, where I would not describe Workday as extremely competitive. Salesforce, I think perhaps different. Salesforce is clearly the incumbent in most accounts, not Oracle. We're, frankly, the guy coming up with a challenger capability, and we now bring a suite of capability with marketing in addition to sales automation. And we do a lot of things that they don't do. We really come to the customer with a different approach. As opposed to trying to help the customer basically report what the sales force is bidding on. We actually come to market trying to help the sales force, meaning our customers' sales forces, sell more stuff all the way from automating a marketing campaign to the actual process by which they communicate to the customer, get information about the customer and actually go through a whole engineering and selling process with the customer. And this is proven. You've heard it with our numbers. Our sales automation solutions in the quarter were superb. Marketing had a fantastic quarter. We are the leader in marketing. We are challenging very aggressively in sales automation, and we expect to give them a run for their money in every sales automation deal in the planet. But our differentiation, Heather, comes from bringing a suite of capability to help the sales -- or our customer's sales organization sell.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nGreat. And Heather, as far as sequential growth in support -- in constant currency, it's up sequentially between 1% and 2%. The only change you see in the tables is as a result of currency, so sequentially up in software license updates and product support.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brad Reback (Analysts)】\nJust one quick question, Safra. Can you give us a sense of what the FX impact was on cash flow in the quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Safra Catz (Executives)】\nSo about -- it was -- well, about half of the decline in cash flow, a little bit more, I think, was actually entirely currency, and a little of it, frankly, was tax payments that under circumstances in some jurisdictions where you pay and then you discuss it. And then a little of it actually ended up being in an inventory buildup that we're doing right now, about $100 million of inventory buildup in preparation for all of the engineered systems that go out in Q4. So we do the buildup of the pieces in Q3. So I'd say -- I know you asked about currency, but currency is about half of it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kash Rangan (Analysts)】\nMark, could you talk about the Engineered Systems business? Certainly, growth of 15% is outpacing the market, but how is the split of business between the Quarter Rack, Half Rack, Full Rack or if you want to look at it based on the products, Exadata, Exalogic, Exalytics? How is that shaping out? What do you think the mix shift in this business is going to look like the next 12 months or so? What I'm really trying to get an angle on is can the business get better as a result of greater 12c adoption as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nYes. So let me -- there's a lot of questions tied up there, so let me try to hit as many as I can. First, I think, to your point, when you look at our competitive results in high-end servers, we're gaining a ton of share. So just to make sure, you said growing a bit faster. All of our competitors, really, in this space are highly negative, and as we've talked about, growth was 15% in the quarter. It is spread between a solid -- I would say, a solid Exadata quarter all the way around. We grew in Exadata, and this is going against, I know you know this, Kash, fairly tough comparisons with the success of Exadata last year. But we had very strong performance on some of our new engineered systems, so it was pretty well dispersed. We had strong growth in SuperCluster in the quarter. We had strong growth in our Oracle Database Appliance. We had good growth in our Big Data Appliance, which is our Hadoop Oracle appliance that we brought to market. Our Zero Data, one of my favorite named products that we have in the company, the Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance, contributed growth in the quarter. So the suite of products that we brought to market in Engineered Systems as a group had a really strong quarter. And while some of the numbers are small coming off of a baseline, they all contributed, and they were all growing. And in an aggregate, we grew 15%. So I think our pipelines are up overall, and so we feel great about the quarter Engineered Systems delivered and great about our pipeline.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kash Rangan (Analysts)】\nAnd the hardware refresh as it relates to 12c mainstream adoption, could you get a benefit there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nYes, I mean, I think, listen, we've seen a strong uptake of -- well, let me say it another way. The beginnings of the uptake of 12c, I believe that also helps, and it also helps in the context of what we see as 12c and the emergence of private clouds that exist in -- within our customers, where you see many of these architectural moves to these engineered systems as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Sherlund (Analysts)】\nSo Larry, 2 questions. First is, we talk to companies that are native to the SaaS market, they indicate that they'll continue to win business because they have an inherent advantage being natively built for the cloud with ease of implementation and ease of use, and I wondered if you could comment on how you think you stack up now and future releases of Fusion if there's more to be done on that front. And then secondly, you talked about in-memory and 12.1c...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nRick, can I interrupt you right -- on that one. Was the question, some people are SaaS -- people are saying SAP was natively built for the cloud?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Sherlund (Analysts)】\nNo, no, these are the native SaaS companies I'm talking about [indiscernible] ...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nOh, the native SaaS companies. Okay, I misunderstood. Okay, got it. Okay.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Sherlund (Analysts)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nOkay. Well, let me just answer the first part of your question now. We made a big announcement almost 10 years ago that we're rebuilding all of our applications for the cloud. Now it wasn't called the cloud 10 years ago. It was called SaaS. But we said that we're rebuilding everything and the thing called Fusion network, going to rebuild our middleware for the cloud, build our applications on top of our cloud middleware and change our database for the cloud, make it multitenant, make it in-memory, do all of those things. We started a project 10 years ago to rewrite everything. When -- Fusion ERP, every single line of code is brand new. Fusion HCM, every single line of the code is brand new. I can go on and on with all of these -- we -- they're completely rewritten for the cloud as is our -- and our database was not completely rewritten. We added specific features to the database to make it work properly in the cloud, the most prominent of which is the multitenancy feature. We think we put multitenancy at the right level of the stack in the database, rather than multitenancy in the application which creates real security problems, which I'm not going to go into. But we think we have a huge advantage over these -- someone like Workday that doesn't have a database. They built -- Workday kind of built their own little database, and that's what you're buying into when you buy Workday. We built our own little database. It's called Oracle. Workday has its own programming technology. We use this programming technology called Java. So -- we -- and we built everything, everything from scratch. I'm telling you, every single line of code in Fusion HCM is new for the cloud. Every single line of code for Fusion ERP is new for the cloud, and those new cloud applications are based on, by far, the strongest platform. Workday doesn't even have a platform that they sell. They have no platform. They have a platform that they kind of use internally. Salesforce has a platform that we also think is not competitive with our platform. So you're going have to be very specific as what advantages these small companies think they have over us in the cloud when we have, I think, very clearly the strongest platform based on industry standards and years and years of experience. We've adapted that for the cloud. Give you an example how strong our cloud platform is, Salesforce.com uses our cloud platform. Netflix uses our cloud platform. In fact, every single cloud company of size, the top 10, 9 of them use our database in the cloud. Workday is the only one that doesn't. But tell me again the advantages they think they have.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Sherlund (Analysts)】\nYes, ease of implementation and ease of use.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nI don't -- easy to implement, it's easy to say, but we're getting our ERP customers -- can you tell me ease of implementation of what. And we think our cloud ERP is very -- is the best of breed in cloud ERP. We think our cloud HCM is now the best of breed in cloud HCM in the areas of user interface, which is usually what the people mean by ease of use, better adaptive technology, which makes the implementation very, very -- we have very rapid implementations, very low-cost implementations, we think, are competitive with anyone out there. In fact, one of the reasons why our consulting business keeps getting smaller is because our applications implementations take so much less time and effort.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Sherlund (Analysts)】\nOkay. Larry, the second question was with the in-memory capabilities, do you think it's possible that we see a lot more innovation in terms of the type of business processes that we can automate with this next generation of apps in the cloud?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Ellison (Executives)】\nWell, I think a lot of things that used to take a long time will take less time. So manufacturers will run MRP much faster than they used to. People that used to get reports overnight will get those reports instantaneously, so they'll have access to more information. I think there will be -- there are some very interesting applications in terms of security for immediate detection of intrusion. Being able to analyze the data so quickly, we actually can do a better job in security. That's one of the big things that we've been working on for some time. I think there are a lot of existing applications that you used to wait overnight for. You'll get that data instantaneously, and then there'll be a host of new applications. But how revolutionary that will be, I think this is going to happen. People will discover these new applications over a fairly long period of time. So as excited as we are about in-memory databases and -- oh, and by -- and we have by far the fastest in-memory database in the world. But again, the first benefit is to make the existing apps run much faster. The second benefit -- and that will happen right away. The second benefit will trickle in over years as people -- as smart people discover new ways to build applications they never thought -- that were -- just weren't possible before the in-memory database.\n\n---\n\n【質問: S.

We've seen 2 quarters in a row of hardware growth in constant currency, and you mentioned double-digit growth in Engineered Systems. But I'm curious on the core M and T server lines in storage and what's happening there and your visibility into the entire hardware bucket growth being sustainable going forward. And then I'd love also your thoughts on large company appetite to move core ERP to the cloud, especially as we think outside of North America in the international sphere.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mark Hurd (Executives)】\nThank you. To your point, Engineered Systems, I already went through it. It is now a significant part of our hardware portfolio and grew 15% and while down is a smaller piece of our hardware portfolio being the M-Series of SPARC. T was down in the quarter, again, all offset by the growth we've seen in Engineered Systems. Storage grew in the quarter. We had significant -- a very strong growth in ZFS, if you will, our network attached storage product. That is not a new story, our ZFS growth, and I predict that will continue as we go forward. We have just released a new SAN product, FS1, that came to us through the Pillar acquisition that our engineering team has done super job for us.

I think I said a couple of quarters ago, we're just going to get better and better at this. And while the numbers are faster than I predicted and I'm -- I wish I could have predicted them better 2 or 3 quarters ago, our sales force has simply just gotten more productive. They're better educated with better products, and they now have references in virtually every single discipline and pillar that we sell in almost every country that we sell. And so what's happening, it's very interesting. We're getting bigger, and we're growing faster as we're getting bigger. And it's because of a multitude of these issues that I'm describing that have all now tilted our way after, frankly, 2, 2.5 years of hard work of getting our customers, similar to the last question, who now know their functional buyer. They know they the head, the Chief Marketing Officer. They know the Chief Human Resource Officer. Our products have now gotten extremely mature, and we've got references. And I think now that we add PaaS to our cloud offerings -- and I probably should have said this earlier, but I've been doing this a long time, and I've really never seen a pipeline grow as fast as our PaaS pipeline has grown. We really released this at OpenWorld in October and the speed of our pipeline -- you see it just in the conversion to bookings. I actually -- Safra and I get to see it in the benefit of the pipeline, and it is just exciting times for Oracle. Back to Ken.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ken Bond (Executives)】\nThank you, Mark.

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you. And thank you for joining us for a discussion of Paychex's Third Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Results. Joining me today on the call is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.\r\nThis morning, before the market open, we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2015. We will file our Form 10-Q, which provides additional discussion and analysis of the results for the quarter by the end of the day. Our earnings release and Form 10-Q will be available on our Investor Relations page at paychex.com. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 1 month.\r\nOn today's call, I will update you on the highlights in our operations, sales and product development areas. Efrain will talk through our third quarter financial results and our guidance as we wrap up fiscal 2015. And then we'll open it up for your questions.\r\nWe were pleased with our third quarter results as we continue to make good progress toward our key initiatives. Our selling season execution was very strong, producing double-digit growth and new annualized revenue sold. We're pleased with that. We also continued our success in adding new bank and franchise referral arrangements and increasing our web leads in addition to our CPA referral channel.\r\nWe remain focused on selling great value to our clients, helping them realize the full breadth of technology and service that Paychex has to offer. Demand for our HR outsourcing solutions continues to advance with gains in both clients and worksite employees. This has made a significant contribution to our double-digit growth in HRS revenue. Payroll service revenue continues to advance as a result of increases in revenue per check and client base growth.\r\nTotal service revenue increased 8% for the third quarter, 9% for the 9 months. As we have expanded our portfolio of SaaS-based bundled offerings, Paychex Flex, which includes online time-and-attendance and HR administration among many other capabilities, we have also greatly enhanced our personalized dedicated service. Paychex Flex offers powerful workforce management capabilities in a simple and streamlined user experience. Our new service initiative also offers clients the flexibility of choice for their service needs. This approach gives clients access to a variety of customer service options, based on their size and complexity, including our 7/24 customer service. \r\nOur mobility app continues to see a fast-growing number of users, both clients and their client employees. This app provides a single easily accessed mobile source to all of the products and information that the client subscribes to from us. \r\nWe have continued to add more functionality, including last quarter's Web time punch capability. \r\nWe are also gaining additional market acceptance of our new full service product to help clients navigate health care reform. We are uniquely positioned to leverage payroll data with our nationally recognized insurance agency and our clients assist -- and offer our clients assistance and value in understanding the requirements of the Affordable Care Act and its impact on their business and employees. We help our clients navigate these complex requirements, avoid fines and penalties and reduce the administrative work necessary to remain in compliance with the law.\r\nOur operations team led us through a good year-end for our clients, producing and distributing W-2s ahead of schedule and continuing to keep our client service and retention at record levels. \r\nWe recently released the newest version of our applicant tracking system, myStaffingPro, which has expanded mobility and new features designed to enhance the job candidate experience by reducing data entry, improving completion rates and providing ability to create candidate differentiators. This improved candidate experience helps our clients increase their applicant pools and can also utilize the enhanced tools to better screen their applicants.\r\nIn summary, we had a solid quarter and made progress on many fronts, including strong sales execution, service delivery, product development and deployment and financial performance. I appreciate the great work of our entire Paychex team across the country.\r\nI will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer, to review the financial results in more detail. Efrain?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Marty, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to remind you what I customarily remind you of that during today's conference call, we'll make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such, involve some risks. Refer to the 10-Q for a full discussion of these risks.\r\nBefore I get into the specifics of the quarter results, I'd just like to say the fourth quarter expectations for payroll and HRS revenue indicate that we'll meet the full year guidance that we'd provided throughout the year. More on fiscal 2015 guidance later on.\r\nIn addition, we introduced our minimum premium plan health insurance offering for PEO clients and worksite employees in the third quarter of last year. We have just passed the anniversary of this new health insurance offering and we have seen strong acceptance by our PEO clients.\r\nDue to the self-insurance provisions within the new offering, certain PEO direct costs are now classified as operating expenses, rather than a reduction in service revenue. This change had no impact on operating income, although it did have some impact on margin, as those of you who have been looking at our results over the last 3 quarters understand. This new health insurance offering did not have an impact on our fiscal 2015 -- third quarter and 9-month results.\r\nAs Marty indicated, our third quarter financial results for fiscal 2015 represented continued progress, building on solid start we experienced through the first half of the year. Here are some of the key highlights. I will provide detail in certain areas. And then I'm going to wrap with a review of our full year 2015 outlook.\r\nTotal service revenue grew 8% for the third quarter to $694 million and 9%, $2 billion for the 9 months. Interest on funds held for clients increased 2% for the third quarter and 3% for the 9 months to $11 million and $31 million, respectively. These fluctuations were driven by an increase in average investment balances.\r\nExpenses increased 10% for the third quarter and 11% for the 9 months, primarily in compensation-related costs and the PEO direct costs that I mentioned previously. \r\nDriving a portion of this increase in PEO direct costs, the new health insurance offering accounted for approximately 3 percentage points of the growth in total expenses for the third quarter and 4 percentage points of the growth year-to-date. The plan has grown significantly in the number of worksite employees enrolled in the plan since it began a year ago. The increase in compensation-related costs was driven by higher employee benefit related costs, together with higher sales headcount and performance-based comp costs associated with the strong sales execution that Marty mentioned. We also continued to support investment in product development.\r\nOperating income, net of certain items increased 6% for the third quarter and for the 9 months grew to $254 million and $771 million, respectively. We maintained strong operating margins and anticipate that our full year will remain within our guidance range, which I'll discuss shortly. \r\nDiluted earnings per share increased 5% to $0.46 per share for the third quarter and 8% to $1.41 per share for the 9 months. Net income increased 6% to $169 million for the third quarter and 7% to $514 million for the 9 months.\r\nTurning to payroll service revenue. It increased 2% for the third quarter and 4% for the 9 months. We benefited from increases in revenue per check in client base. Revenue per check growth resulted from price increases net of discounting along with the impact of increased product penetration. Checks per payroll grew but at a more moderate rate than we had projected. \r\nWe expected payroll revenue results for the third quarter to moderate as we shared during the second quarter earnings call. As we indicated in last quarter's call, timing shifts between the quarters and lower checks per payroll drove the results. We expect a return to more normalized growth rate in the fourth quarter, expect it to be comparable to the first half of the year. And full year guidance for payroll revenue remains unchanged.\r\nTurning to HRS. Revenue increased 19% for both the third quarter and for the 9 months. We experienced strong growth in both clients and worksite employees of Paychex HR Services. The new minimum premium health insurance offering also contributed 5 percentage points of the growth in HRS revenue during the third quarter.\r\nRetirement services revenue benefited from pricing together with increases in the number of plans and average asset value of participants' funds. Insurance services benefited from the ramp-up of our new full service offering to comply with health care reform requirements, a moderate increase in the number of health and benefit applicants and higher premiums in our workers' comp insurance product. Our online HR administrative services continue to experience growth in clients.\r\nTurning to our investment portfolio. Our continued goal was to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We invest in high-quality, lower-risk instruments primarily in variable rate demand notes and bank demand deposits for short-term funds and municipal bonds for our longer-term portfolio. Our longer-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.6% and an average duration of 3.2 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 0.9% for the third quarter and 1% for the 9 months, consistent with the same periods last year.\r\nAverage balances for interest on funds held for clients increased during the third quarter and 9 months, primarily driven by wage inflation, together with growth in the client base. We are not -- now on a gradual upswing from the impact of the declining rates that began in 2008. Our average reinvestment yields are now meeting or slightly exceeding the weighted average yield on our longer-term portfolio. As such, we are not seeing a significant negative impact from turnover in the portfolio.\r\nThe Fed has indicated that it is possible that they will raise rates later in the year, which could have a positive impact on our interest income earned on our client and corporate portfolios.\r\nI will now walk you through highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total investments of approximately $1 billion as of the end of the quarter and no debt.\r\nFunds held for clients as of February 28, 2015 were $5.1 billion compared to $4.2 billion as of May 2014. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $4.4 billion for the quarter and $3.9 billion for the 9 months. This reflects growth of 3% for both periods. \r\nTotal stockholders' equity was $1.9 billion as of February 28, 2015, reflecting $414 million in dividends paid during the 9 months and 1.7 million shares were purchased for approximately $70 million. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 36%.\r\nCash flows from operations were $693 million for the first 9 months, a slight decrease from the prior year. The change was the result of fluctuations in working capital partially offset by higher net income. The fluctuations in working capital between periods were primarily related to the timing of income tax payments, you look at the prepaid line on the cash flow statement, you see that, and collections from clients' payments for compensation PEO payroll. It's common for our working capital to fluctuate between quarters.\r\nNow let me turn to fiscal 2015 guidance and I'll keep it fairly short. I'd like to remind you that our outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant change. And I'll just summarize it by saying our guidance is unchanged from what we provided beginning of the fiscal year. \r\nBefore I turn things over to Marty, I want to let you know that Paychex will be hosting Investor Day in mid-July. We are working on a transportation-friendly day, so you can get in and out on the same day if you are on the East Coast or the Midwest. Sorry for those on the West Coast. We can't figure out how to make that work. It's going to be scheduled for Wednesday, July 15, here in Rochester. We'll post a save-the-date message on our IR website and we will be providing registration information and other details in mid-April. We hope to see many of you in the summer.\r\nI'll turn it back to Marty.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Efrain. We'll now open the call to questions.",

      "transcript_text3": "Can you provide a little more detail on the underlying drivers behind the double-digit growth and new annualized revenue as told during the peak selling season, in particular, breakdown between payroll service and HR services bookings?\n\n---\n\nWell, David, we don't usually give that much detail on it. But I will tell you that we were strong across the board. I would say both payroll -- all areas of payroll as well as HRS were both very strong and probably the best sales. And we had a pretty good sales we've seen over the last year. But this is probably the best sales results in the selling season we've seen in, I would say, 7 or 8 years.\n\n---\n\nWhat accounts for that?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think very good execution on the sales side. I also think that the channels that we've been developing from our constant CPA channel has been -- continued to be strong. The bank channel, we picked up a lot from the bank channel from a referral standpoint. We've also added a number of franchise arrangements, where we're the supported or the preferable company per payroll. And I think we've just done a good job overall, also team selling. So going in is not just payroll and then coming back to sell the other ancillary services, but going in right up-front and selling the full value of all the products to the client right up-front. So we've seen good growth in payroll. We've seen good growth in HRS, in the Affordable Care Act products. Our Employer Shared Responsibility product has been strong and certainly HR outsourcing, both PEO and ASO. All have been strong. I think it's execution. I think it's a lot of the work that the Head of Sales, Mark Bottini, has been doing with that team to build a good referral and pipeline as well.\n\n---\n\nWith that rate of new annualized recurring revenue growth, taken together with your current client retention trend, point to a change in your revenue growth rate for FY '16 and '17?\n\n---\n\nWell, I can't really get into guidance now. I think we'll have a better sense of that at the next quarter to talk about '16. But it certainly bodes well for a start anyway.\n\n---\n\nI just wanted to start off on the core payroll side, the growth of 2% or I guess, I'm close to like 2.4%, the way we calculate it. But anything else to call out there aside from timing, meaning, was there any sort of slippage maybe on the pricing side, 2Q to 3Q, or a bit of a slower rate of client growth or anything else?\n\n---\n\nYes. Good question. So client growth, no. Pricing, no. Checks, a little bit less than we expected. So a little bit of color on that. So we've seen moderation in checks per payroll. We're not calling it out specifically because when it's trending around 1%, it really is not a significant contributor to revenue overall. But what we did see was that checks have just been a little lighter. We're a little bit lighter in the quarter than we anticipated. Now just 2 more points of detail on that. What's interesting about that number is -- again, I ruled out client and I ruled out price, because that's not a driver here. Timing is primarily the reason. But secondarily, what's going on is that even though we saw an increase in the amount of bonus dollars that we paid in checks, that's what we seem to be seeing in the data, we actually saw a slight decrease in the amount of bonus checks. So it looks like people were being paid a little bit more in bonuses. But the size of those bonuses resulted in lower checks. So it was a little bit lighter. And that really kind of drove much of the difference in payroll service revenue. We've accounted for that as we look forward. I think we're just in this environment now where with check per client or check per payroll growth is going to be moderate going forward. So that's some color on that point.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just my second question on the prior earnings call, I think you guys talked a little bit about M&A and sort of your appetite to do something there. Just curious what you're seeing out there in the marketplace and if you still have an appetite for I guess what you would consider a large-scale acquisition in addition to any tuck-ins?\n\n---\n\nYes, we do. I think there's -- we still see a lot available. We're looking at more than we probably ever have in the past. Everything is pretty highly valued, so we're going to be very selective as to what we do. But we're looking at both something that would be product tuck-ins, but also just add to the base because we think, whether it's PEO, payroll or other services, we think we're pretty effective at what we're -- how we're executing and it's a good time to acquire. We may not find something, but we're pretty deep into a number of things we're looking at, at the time, so -- and size would be -- we'd be very selective, but we certainly have the cash to do it if that makes sense.\n\n---\n\nAnd just to be clear, you're going to be sticking to your knitting, so sort of a payroll acquisition or something in that area or in HRS services? You'll not going into any sort of other areas?\n\n---\n\nYes. Yes, that's correct.\n\n---\n\nThis is Ryan Cary calling in for Jason. I just want to build on, on George's question. Although you reiterated the full year guide of 3% to 5% for the payroll services, has your outlook on where you might fall on that range changed at all after this quarter? Meaning, do you expect 4Q to make up for any of the moderate softness or a little bit below that range that we saw in 3Q?\n\n---\n\nWhen we issued guidance, we expect to be somewhere around the middle. For the year, I think that's where we're at right now.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And did you see any material changes in the competitive environment as you got deeper into the peak calendar year-end selling season? And I have to ask a question on pricing as well. Last quarter you seemed comfortable pricing would stand at say 2% to 4% band. Has there been any material change in either direction over the last quarter? Just would love any additional color?\n\n---\n\nYes. Ryan, I don't think so. We didn't really see -- because actually we feel very good about the quarter from a selling perspective. I would say the competitive environment was about the same. Didn't see any extra pricing pressure. There's always competitive pricing pressure out there. But we didn't see anything pick up necessarily. There was no big competitor plans or things that they were doing that we saw that made any big difference there. So I'd say pricing is generally holding like we thought it was last quarter and competitive environment's about the same.\n\n---\n\nSure. Efrain, you mentioned that payroll service revenue was being deferred from third quarter into fourth quarter. Now that you're through the third quarter, can you give us a sense of magnitude of that -- and this is David Ridley-Lane for Sara Gubins.\n\n---\n\nYes, I thought it was you, David. David, I think it's implicit in what I said that we expect to be somewhere in the middle of the range. If you heard my comments earlier, I said that fourth quarter was going to be comparable to the first half of the year, and I kind of leave it at that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then could we get an update on the sensitivity of the portfolio to the first 25 or 50 basis points of interest rate increase?\n\n---\n\nYes. On the short-term it's going to be about $4 million, somewhere in that range, it could be a little bit less, a little bit more. And that just assumes the short-term reprices. What that does to long-term rates is a good question. I don't have a crystal ball on that. And timing at this point, our best guesstimate is Q2. But again, our crystal ball has been exceedingly fuzzy.\n\n---\n\nI just have a couple of follow-up questions on the minimum premium plan. Maybe you can talk about how the claims have trended versus your expectations and whether you've gotten any closer throwing out this offering to more states?\n\n---\n\nYes. So I would say that claims experienced thus far has been about what we expected. We're pretty conservative in terms of our approach and takes kind of a belt-and-suspenders view from an actuarial perspective. We had 2 actuaries look at it and have pretty extensive conversations about how we set prices. I think one thing that I'd just like to reiterate from our perspective, the PEO is not an insurance play. It's an HR outsourcing play. So we understand the perils of selling cheap insurance in the PEO and it's not a direction we want to go in. So I think claims have trended about where we expected them to be. I didn't get -- I forgot the second half of your question, Smitti.\n\n---\n\nJust can you give us an update in terms of your plans relative to offering to do more states?\n\n---\n\nYes. At this point, we're still getting through kind of a full year of this one. We feel very good about it. As Efrain said, I think we've done very well on the claims and so forth, but it's a year into it. And we don't have any immediate plans to expand it outside of the area. But that is where a big amount of our sales are. So I think we'll give it a little bit more experience before we look to expand it.\n\n---\n\nAnd on -- this is just following along on a minimum plan. Can you talk about how the client ramp has looked like over the past year and whether you switched existing clients over or whether it's really new clients signing up for the product?\n\n---\n\nIt's primarily new clients that were signing up. When you -- when we initially did it, we obviously moved existing clients onto the plan. Now what we're doing is we're selling new clients. I would say PEO client base is growing nicely, double-digit. So I would -- one thing I hope we're not leaving the impression that it's the minimum premium plan driving PEO growth. It really is that there is a lot of interest in the market now for bundled HR outsourcing solutions plus -- that it also includes healthcare and that's driving the market.\n\n---\n\nCan you help us contrast the double-digit growth in annualized new sales? I guess what was that growth number a year or 2 ago? How much of an improvement is that versus what you've seen in the last couple of years?\n\n---\n\nWell, I would say it certainly gone from single digit, fairly flat actually, to single digit to now double-digit growth in par with annualized revenue. And so it's -- this is, as I said, I think this is probably the best selling season we've seen in 7 or 8 years. So I think very good execution. I think it's much stronger than last year, which was pretty good. And it's -- as I said, it's pretty much across the board. So it's not just PEO and the HRS services. It's a good team selling. We're seeing good both payroll and HR outsourcing, 401(k) really across the board. I think this is very good execution. And I do think, obviously, that the market's coming back a little bit from a small business and midsize business environment too. So I'd say how I'd characterize it, Tim, as best in 7 or 8 years from an increase standpoint from a total par standpoint.\n\n---\n\nLast year was improved, but that was still kind of mid-single digits last year even?\n\n---\n\nIt was in single digits. I wouldn't characterize it as mid-single digits.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And does it change your thoughts on -- I think you've talked about trying to get unit growth or client growth back up to kind of somewhere in the 1% to 3% range. Where's your thoughts on that as you, I guess, exit the selling season based on what you saw?\n\n---\n\nWell, it's still a combination. I mean, we want the units and the revenue both, and that's the way our comp plans and our incentives are set. So we're still looking for both, and we're still trying to -- we certainly expect to be in that range from a client growth perspective.\n\n---\n\nBut you want to be -- I guess, I was trying to see if you would increase that range, given the sales season or if it's a -- so in other words, I guess, if you still would say 1% to 3%?\n\n---\n\nYes, I would still stay in that range from client growth perspective. I think this is an ability to sell higher revenue per client as much as product. It is selling more complete bundles to clients and more complete and more ancillary services as well. And so I think the client growth would still be in that same range. It wouldn't necessarily bring that up. But I think we're selling more revenue per client because of the better execution, the team selling, et cetera.\n\n---\n\nEfrain, you talked a little bit about the float. Are we at a point now -- if we assume that rates stay kind of where they are and don't worry about increases, that float income year-over-year should be flat and if rates go up that you can start seeing an increase there?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think you should see it tick up modestly. Yes, I think that's where we're at. We've kind of -- we weathered the storm, and the storm appears to have passed. Hopefully, we're not in the eye of something. But it's -- it seems to be that the worst certainly has passed. And from the perspective of the portfolio and how we will manage it, interest rates now just represent an upside, as I'd like to say, the embedded optionality of the stock.\n\n---\n\nAnd Marty, you talked a little bit about price increases and this quarter you haven't seen really any increased competition. Now as you look at the next price increase, which I think you usually do some time in the May time frame, anything changed in the environment which would change your mind as to the type of price increase that you would do this fiscal year compared to what you were able to do the current fiscal year?\n\n---\n\nNo, I think we'd still be in that same range. I think we've gotten more sophisticated as to kind of where we put the price increase based on clients, products and the competitive nature of those products with the portfolio of different products we have. But I still think you'd expect us to be in that -- you should expect us to be in that 2% to 4% range.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just one last question. Efrain, you alluded to this a little bit when you were talking about the PEO. And I'm wondering, is there a way to quantify any ACA benefits you're getting and if that benefit goes away next year. Or is the PEO, at least the way you look at it, and the HRS business, the trends are fairly strong, so we should continue to kind of see the growth you've been witnessing?\n\n---\n\nMy initial answer to that is that I would expect a continuation of trends. Having said that, we are going through the planning process and having our usual discussions with sales about what we think is attainable. I think we're -- it's fair to say we're in a favorable environment. How we set that for next year's plans still remains to be decided.\n\n---\n\nJust going back to the minimum premium plan for one more question. Can you give us a sense, is that growing much more quickly than other PEO? And I guess now that we've annualized you adding that, I'm trying to think, will that be growing faster and thus be somewhat of a drag on margins even though there's little profit impact for several more quarters? Or is most of that behind you now that you've lapped the introduction of that?\n\n---\n\nI think next quarter is when it will pretty much anniversary, Gary. So we'll see a little bit of drag into next quarter. And then starting the following quarter, it should be a more fair compare. But the point you're making is a fair one. To the extent that more PEO clients attach health care, it does have a slight drag on margins simply because we don't get much of a margin flow through. But after fourth quarter, it shouldn't be significant.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then I think we all know PEO is, because of the past, there is this somewhat lower margin. But when you look at the mix of new business, and just the composition of your growth in the last year or 2 and going forward, how do we think about the puts and takes around margins? Is stuff -- a lot of stuff coming in at a lower margin or some of it is add-on, is that just incrementally more profitable for existing customers? What are the main issues?\n\n---\n\nYes. So Gary, that's a good question. The answer is, if you look at most of HRS with the exclusion -- exception of PEO, if I take all of those products, they are all growing pretty strongly and they all have margins that are comparable to payroll. One exception to that is insurance. But it's still too small to exert and an overall drag on margin. So the answer is we shouldn't see significant dilution. There may be a moderate impact if PEO really, really starts to grow much faster than everything else. It's been growing nicely. But it's part of the mix and it's reflected in our results. So unless that really took off, it shouldn't have a significant impact on overall margins.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then just one last one. Last time, the company got north of $1 billion of net cash and corporate investment, there was a sizable buyback. I think it seems like you've been more likely to do some steady buybacks over time rather than the one big dip. So I wondered if you've given any thought to maybe a special dividend or some other way of earning more quick proportion of that excess cash.\n\n---\n\nYes. So we -- I guess my nuanced answer to that is that when it's above $1 billion, we have to think about what we do with it. And it's a function of where we are with respect to opportunities within the M&A portfolio. So to the extent we don't see those materializing in a shorter-term time frame, then we have to have that conversation with the board. And they're ultimately going to decide what makes sense. But we'll be having those conversations.\n\n---\n\nOn the double-digit new bookings growth, do you think we'll see that more in HR or somewhat in payroll? Or how's that going to lay out?\n\n---\n\nI think both of them are pretty strong, but I think it's a little stronger in the HR side. That's obviously where we have more opportunity to sell the ancillary, the wide breadth of ancillary products that we have. So a little bit stronger on the HR side, particularly, as Efrain said, between PEO, ASO, 401(k), our online services, time and attendance and everything -- kind of everything but payroll is in there. So I think it's certainly been a little stronger on the HR side, but both have been good.\n\n---\n\nAnd I'd say this, Jim, that Marty mentioned it was double digit. It was in the fourth quarter double -- I'm sorry, fourth quarter -- third quarter, it was in double digit in payroll. So to Marty's point, we were pretty strong across the board.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And this I think is similar to other questions. But as people continue to adopt the minimum premium plan, will you continue to get a little bit of a tailwind in revenue growth that you sort of had this year from the new revenue recognition?\n\n---\n\nYes. That's a good question. You really don't see as much of it next year. We really obviously got a -- there are 2 things. We obviously got an uplift this year. We've been careful to call it out because we don't want people to misunderstand what's going on in the underlying numbers and most people understand it. We were within $3 million of what The Street had on revenue. So everyone understands kind of what's going on. You get a modest tick-up. But after this year, the impact is not significant.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just one sort of thing. On the repurchase, your share count kind of started to drift back up again. Any thoughts on that?\n\n---\n\nYes. I wish the share count didn't drift up. Yes, we will -- I would say we'll repurchase opportunistically. I think that's where we're at right now. Before -- I think Gary's question earlier on would we do something more, we'll have to take a look at where we are with M&A and address whether we think something larger is warranted.\n\n---\n\nThis is Evan Bull on for Bryan. Just real quick on the bookings growth in the December and January quarters. Just maybe directionally, was that ahead of your expectations, below or right at, just kind of given the magnitude of those months.\n\n---\n\nI think it was pretty close to our expectations. I mean, we set pretty high goals for the sales team and what we expected particularly in selling season. I'd say it was pretty much at our expectations because we set pretty high ones.\n\n---\n\nSure, that helps. And then you guys have introduced a number of SaaS-based products over the course of the past year. Can you just maybe talk about the traction with those products and then maybe the competition and kind of the competitive dynamic there? Aside from ADP, who else are the players that you're kind of competing with directly?\n\n---\n\nYes. I always hate the name competitors because it just gives them credibility. I think ADP is the one we run into the most. There's a couple of other that have recently gone through IPOs you run into. But we're winning some of those clients back actually right now over service issues and so forth. So I think from a product standpoint, we stand up very competitively. And all SaaS, the ability of the SaaS products and the bundling of these and the integration is so critical to us. And we're continuing, you'll see over the next 6 months, to really even more fully integrate a lot of kind of, I think, the kind of best-in-class products. So we have myStaffingPro, for example, which is sold and integrated. But it will see even better integration this year as well as stratustime, which is I think the leading time-and-attendance SaaS offering that we purchased last June. And now you'll see it. Not only is it integrated now, but it will go much more of a full integration. So we compete very well. It's still primarily with ADP. And then there's some of the pays that we call them that you'll see, but again, we're starting to win those back. They're pretty small losses for them at this stage.\n\n---\n\nThanks for taking my question. First one is probably just on the timing impact. You guys talk about double-digit growth you're seeing in bookings, how long does it take to actually see that from a revenue side?\n\n---\n\nYou'll start to see that probably a couple of quarters out. That's when -- so the first quarter, not much. Depending on where it occurred, you start to get the client set up. There's a little bit of time. And then probably after the second quarter, that's when you're starting to see the impact.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Probably if you could provide some color on some of the new products, which you guys have launched over the last few quarters. PEO, I understand it's at a lower margin profile on the group level. But just thinking about these newer products, are there any products or services which are at higher margin than the group level?\n\n---\n\nI'd say, as Efrain mentioned earlier, most of the products are at a pretty strong margin level across the board. I think insurance, Efrain mentioned, was pretty strong margin and -- but that's still a small part of the business, although the insurance, the health insurance in particular, workers' comp has always been pretty strong. The health insurance is really starting to pick up now. And that's in addition to the Affordable Care Act products that we have. I think our -- as a business, we work very hard to make sure we have the strongest margins possible obviously with our high margins in the industry now and we keep trying to drive those. But I think when you look at the newer products that we've either purchased or built, stratustime from a time-and-attendance SaaS product, myStaffingPro from a recruitment and applicant tracking product, BeneTrac, the benefit enrollment, all of those will have pretty good margins particularly as we build scale and more fully integrate them into the bundle. So all those products are doing well and they're getting out of the gate. And this is even before we more fully integrate them into the Paychex Flex, our SaaS -- kind of a SaaS base for the whole thing.\n\n---\n\nAnd probably just last one regarding float income. Yes, there's some positive comments coming from Fed, and you might end up seeing some positive impact from that. But just from a long-term strategy around your portfolio, would you be open to considering options like small business lending, given your strong distribution strength and strong customer base?\n\n---\n\nTo answer your question, S.K., we have that discussion probably I would say once a quarter. The challenge we see there -- so we're looking at ways to partner. We do partner with Biz2Credit on small business loans and our referral arrangement. We're just very cautious about tiptoeing into an area that could be highly regulated. So that's why we've been cautious about doing it. It's an area of interest. If we could participate a little bit more fully, we'd look at it. But that's the inhibitor.\n\n---\n\nEfrain, not to nitpick here, but in looking at the supplemental schedule, if I look at the operating margin guidance for the fourth quarter, 35% to 36%, I think last quarter, that number was 36% to 37%. Is there something going on that we should be aware of?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think, Jeff, so what -- first of all, eagle eyes there. I did not call it out except that in my comments, what you saw were -- was some discussion about higher costs in the quarter. And the higher costs were driven by -- primarily by sales-related expense. And so we're just simply calling out that we think, given strong sales performance now, we're moderating a little bit the margin, given the strong sales performance in the back half of the year. That's what's driving that modest change.\n\n---\n\nThat makes sense. And I wish I could take credit for it, but somebody pointed it out to me. Just one other question. You mentioned on the checks per payroll, and I know it's not as big of an issue as it was before and that you expect more normalized growth in the fourth quarter. Is that because of the bonus issue you mentioned that shouldn't really impact the quarter?\n\n---\n\nYes. So it's not going to impact the quarter. And I think the timing shifts that I discussed in Q2, these happen from time to time -- I'm sorry, that I mentioned in Q3. That doesn't occur in Q4. And then we're back at a more normalized rate, like what you saw in the first half of the year.\n\n---\n\nI was wondering if you could just step back to the growth in HRS and perhaps help us better understand the ASO versus the PEO and what the trends are you are seeing with the buyers of each of those different products?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think primarily the PEO has typically been in states where they're just more comfortable and more used to PEOs and -- but I think what's expanded a little bit from a PEO side, David, is there -- because of the Affordable Care Act, they're looking more to kind of feel more comfortable kind of within a co-employer relationship. So there's a little bit more acceptance, I think, to the PEO in not just the typical states, the Florida, Texas, et cetera, type of states. So we do see that growing. And I think that's been frankly a lot of the Affordable Care Act has pushed more people into seeing the opportunity and just feeling more comfortable being part of a shared kind of employment service. And those who don't need to go that far have the ASO. And both -- I think the ASO's still coming primarily at it from an HR outsourcing type of business. We've seen that drop down. So where clients didn't think about HR outsourcing at 30 employees or 20 employees now do because of the complexity of the regulations of the hiring and firing and other compliance issues. So both are growing. I think PEO still tends to grow a little bit more from thinking -- starting to think about insurance, but then realizing that the HR support is there and that's why they buy totally because that's really how we sell it, as the value of HR support. But the -- and the ASO continues to be HR. And I just think it's so complex now, the Affordable Care Act, there's a number of immigration reform issues that are out there for hiring and so forth. All of these things add more people to say, \"Hey, I want to be -- I want to outsource my HR to somebody who's going to stay current.\" And of course, we've been a leader in this business. We have more client employees than anybody else in the business by far that we service and in -- over 400 individuals around the country, who service the clients face to face. And I think that's made for great growth.\n\n---\n\nAnd to build on that, David. I think that when you look at how we are going to market and how we sell that product, ASO tends to be, as Marty mentioned, tends to be a little bit lower typically worksite employees and within the base. PEO tends to be a little bit bigger and a combination of inside the base and outside the base. So our PEO sales are not just to existing Paychex clients but also outside the base.\n\n---\n\nAnd is development growth rate, just without getting into specific numbers, are they comparable? And if not, do you expect them to diverge at all over the next couple of years?\n\n---\n\nI think they're generally comparable. Yes, they're pretty close on both sides. It's just the preference for what -- how the client thinks. I think the other thing that we probably didn't mention is selling this more up-front, we have found that typically our model was sell them payroll then come back and say, \"Do you need HR services in 3 months or 6 months?\" And we're selling much more up-front. If we think the client is of a 20-plus in their complexity, we will go in and team sell. And I think we're winning more clients right up-front on an ASO or PEO basis.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just one other question. Are you -- do you sell the ancillary services without payroll? And if you don't, have you ever considered doing that?\n\n---\n\nGood question. So the answer is yes, we do. Although, for example, we reported I believe last year about 580,000 clients, we think we had in excess of 20,000 clients that don't take payroll but take other ancillary products. And I think, David, it points to the fact that the company that we were part of the recession is very different from the company that we emerged out of the recession. We're much more of an integrated full-service provider to small- and medium-sized businesses and you're starting to see that in the client base. And we'll update some of that information when we get to the end of the year.\n\n---\n\nWith regards to the core payroll growth that you've seen, can you characterize where you're seeing the strongest growth in terms of -- is it the smallest end of your client size or just the average small client? And how are -- what are you seeing on the MMS side?\n\n---\n\nI would say on the average, it's not necessarily the smallest clients, although new business formation has picked up some obviously and we're kind of getting back to where we were pre-recession levels. And I think our -- and our sales to new businesses are back up over last year at this time. And so I think there's some small -- but I think primarily it's net average base, if not slightly higher, I'd say, meaning, 1 or 2 employees or something like that. So I think we're right in the average. And in the mid-market, I think it's about the same. I think we focused very heavily on the 50 to 500 in that mid-market space. And I think that's been a very good sweet spot for us. We certainly have clients that are above that. But we're really focusing the team on that 50 to 500. It's a very hot space right now for multiple products. Those are the clients that need multiple products that are integrated and SaaS-based and we fit really well there.\n\n---\n\nSo you're seeing the same level of growth in that 50 to 500 as in that sub-20 group?\n\n---\n\nYes. I'd say, yes, pretty close, I'd say. Yes.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And do you still have some improvements to make to that 50 to 500 products, is that right?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think what I mentioned earlier is over the next 6 months, you'll see even stronger integration. So all on the kind of the same user interface and so forth. So they're integrated today from -- at different levels. But over the next 6 months, stratustime that we acquired last year, myStaffingPro and BeneTrac will see even enhanced integration and...\n\n---\n\nSo it's a single sign-on, single database?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nMark, just to -- I'm sorry, go ahead.\n\n---\n\nWhich will make that even a stronger product right from applicant tracking right through to retirement, as they say, but particularly on the front end of the applicant tracking and the benefit enrollment.\n\n---\n\nBuilding on what Marty said, the way we segment the markets, Mark, is under 50 and 50 to 500. We look at it from a unit basis, the growth is pretty comparable.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Great. And with regards to the sales that you've seen, can you characterize the number of add-on modules that you're seeing now relative to, say, a year ago?\n\n---\n\nAdd-on modules. I guess I'd say we -- if this is what you mean, we sell a lot more bundled services certainly than stand-alone payroll. That's gone up dramatically over the last 4 years.\n\n---\n\nWhat does dramatically mean?\n\n---\n\nI'd say from low double digits as a percent to mid almost, okay, double digit kind of. If you think double -- so where we used to sell probably stand-alone payroll -- and this is a change in the whole sales team, probably 10% to 20% of the -- I'm sorry, bundled services right up-front 10% to 20% of the time. Now we're selling a complete bundle probably 40% to 50% of the time. It's pretty dramatic. But it's the way we've bundled the products as well and the way that sales has looked to increase the revenue per client and really to sell the client everything they need right up-front as part of a bundle.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then what percentage of your sales are now coming from brand new businesses?\n\n---\n\nI'd say it's still close to half. It's still close to that 50%.\n\n---\n\nOkay. But that is picking up?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then if the economy stays as it is, would you expect your new business revenue growth target to basically stay about the same?\n\n---\n\nI think so, yes.\n\n---\n\nYes. Mark, I think it's really been typically between about 45 and low 50s, 52, 53. It's hard to envision that, that changes that much. I mean, part of what distinguishes us from a lot of companies is that we're mining that new base to get our customers. So we get the 3% payroll and they eventually become an 8%, 10%, 20% payroll because we mine that base. So that's part of the way we sell. How we do that, how we go to market over time may change. But that's really core to how we're approaching the market.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then lastly, this is completely separate from new business formations in terms of a question but just specific to your bookings growth. When we take a look at the target that was set and if the environment stays the same in terms of how you're judged, do you think that your target level will roughly stay the same as what we've recently seen in certain documents?\n\n---\n\nOkay. So that's a very wonderfully, elliptical euphemistic way of saying we typically have a pretty tough target. Management doesn't get paid. We don't start having conversations until we're getting close to double digits. So we will expect that we will have a double-digit target. And we will expect that if we don't meet it, we'll suffer the consequences. So that's kind of where we're at from management's comp perspective, obviously, sales has its own set of comp.\n\n---\n\nSo you had mentioned in the release a couple of things that I thought were interesting, and maybe speak to what's happening in the wider world, specifically regarding, number one, pricing, and number two, just the fact that you're starting to see wages move up a little bit. I was wondering if there's any read that you have perhaps more on the wage side than on the pricing side. You've talked a bit about the pricing side, but I'm curious to know what you're seeing on a wider scale with wage inflation, and if that's something you think is going to become an issue in the next few months?\n\n---\n\nI think wages we've generally seen around 2%. So I wouldn't say it's anything overly strong. I think we saw -- Efrain I think mentioned earlier from a bonus perspective, which we watched, bonuses were higher. They weren't -- didn't seem to be as many necessarily or isn't much of an increase as we thought, but they were higher. But general wage has been pretty consistent at around 2% increase.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think you're picking up, John, on the 3% client fund balances. And so that incorporates not only wages, but anything else that we're paying. So it looks like it's ticking up moderately.\n\n---\n\nCan you comment, just following up on the strong bookings and then also increase in sales expense, can you just give a little bit more color around sales productivity and how that's trending compared to say, growth in the sales force?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think we're showing, obviously, good productivity in this third quarter in the selling season from a standpoint of revenue per rep. So we're seeing pretty good productivity there kind of as we projected or set our goals, I guess I'd say. And so that always drives -- when you tie it back to expense in the third quarter because we have a lot of sales in the third quarter with January starts per payroll in particular, that drives the sales expense up. But I would say sales expense kind of per sale is generally consistent with where we thought it would be. And we're continuing to get productivity out of the sales team. I think they're executing very well as you look over the last few years in particular.\n\n---\n\nTerrific. And then second one on the ASO and PEO businesses, how much of the growth there is coming from greenfield versus -- and how many of those deals are you seeing that it's competitive or it's actually a take out?\n\n---\n\nI would say in the PEO side, I think it's probably 60-40. I haven't seen that number lately. But I would say more new. Just when you think about, it trends tended to be with our overall business. So we're 50% new businesses, I think, if that's what you're asking from a payroll standpoint. I think the PEO is similar to that, maybe a little bit more on the new side. But I think it's right in that range of 50-50.\n\n---\n\nTerrific. Okay. And then last one, just a little bit of a longer-term question. You made in your comments up-front, talked a bit about Flex and the health care reform offering and myStaffingPro and then made some comments in response to your question about looking more actively at M&A. Can you just take a step back and give us an idea of looking out 2, 3, 4 years, how you envision the product portfolio evolving?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think when you look out, it will be a fully integrated Software-as-a-Service offering, meaning single database UI, very client friendly. Mobility will be tied into it very directly. One of the things we didn't really comment on today just quickly in the comments is mobility. Our mobile app has been continually -- we've added to the mobile app. And it has seen pretty dramatic usage being picked up even more from client employees than clients. And so we're seeing a nice kind of roll up of client employees, which we think will add to retention by the way which will -- because the client employees now will be interfacing with our products and will get -- we have very positive feedback on the mobility. When you look out, it's going to be that single source for our client to come to us for everything, from hire to retire, as they do now. And I think it will just be a very full product set. I think the M&A piece of it is some product tuck-ins were needed. But to be straightforward, we've got pretty much the products that we need. Now it's finishing the full integration of a single database with them this year. And then it will be adding I think where we can execute and add more ability and make the company more efficient, so PEOs, payroll companies, probably 401(k) is always out there and any offshoot of anything from recruiting, et cetera, those kinds of businesses. So those are pretty wide scope that we look at from an M&A perspective. But our job will be to drive upper single-digit revenue growth on the top line and still be one of the most profitable companies in the business.\n\n---\n\nThis is Robert Simmons on for Joe. So you actually just answered my first question, but what are your thoughts on international expansion?\n\n---\n\nWe -- I have been in Germany now for 9 or 10 years. We doubled our size last year with an acquisition and continued sales growth. So we've got a nice base there. Brazil, we started last year. And we're kind of chugging along. It didn't help that the kind of Brazil economy kind of slowed down at the time that we were starting up there. But we're kind of learning there and we're breaking into the business of winning over the CPA so that they'll refer more of their payroll business out to us. We're still very interested in it. We were going to focus on 2 or 3 countries, kind of the third country we haven't quite found a good entryway in yet. We've looked at a number of them. We -- it will always, I think at this point, it tends to be small. It's going to tend to be small part of where we are as we approach $3 billion in revenue. But it's still of interest to us. And we continue to look at acquisition opportunities and ways to increase sales and profit there.\n\n---\n\nI was just hoping you could give us any updates you might be willing to provide on the short payroll business, specifically. And possibly if you could parse the client growth rate of 1% to 3% and the contribution from the SaaS side.\n\n---\n\nYes. Sure. We don't really -- well, SaaS -- most of our products now or most of our clients are on SaaS, so well over 80% of them. From a growth standpoint, we don't break out SurePayroll anymore. But they're doing fine. I mean, really, they've had good client growth year-over-year. And I think they're competing very effectively with particularly the micro businesses for payroll. All of that is done through Web marketing and sales on the phone once people call in. I think they've been very effective at that in growing their client base. And we continue to be pleased with that and continue to always watch who we're competing against. Not a lot of new competitors there. There -- some start-ups got some -- quite a bit of press for a while, but then it's kind of dropped out a little bit because they're not as -- a full product as Sure. And so I think primarily it's Intuit that we run into as a competitor there. And folks just wanting to stay manual, doing their payroll manually.\n\n---\n\nAnd the other thing I'd add is -- you'd surf the Web, there's a bunch of these different rating services. But they just won a recent award in terms of user access and appearance. And so they are a very, very formidable competitor and platform in that micro enterprise space.\n\n---\n\nI guess my question is as your bookings roll into revenues, can you talk about sort of -- are there other incremental expenses involved? And then taking that question longer term, just longer-term expense growth assumptions where you're making in less [indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nYes. Ashwin, so 2 things. In a quarter when we have particularly strong sales execution, then our expenses tend to ramp up. So we had probably a little bit higher expense growth in the quarter and then in the back half of the year, based on the performance we're seeing. Hopefully, obviously, that leads to a little bit better billed revenue going forward. So -- but I don't think it's -- unless we set our plans too low and they constantly beat them, that's not the way we tend to do it. We tend to set them pretty high. And the sales force has done a great job of rising to the challenge. With respect to expense, where we -- I think there's really going to be no change in terms of the approach we take. We're going to leverage operating expenses as much as we can. We're going to continue to invest in IT, probably at a little bit more of the moderate rate than you've seen in past years or where it then has been embedded in the SG&A number, which is where it appears. And then we're going to continue to make selective investments in sales, where we think there's opportunities to grow the business. So I think that will not change dramatically. Quarter-over-quarter, you might have some changes as results are higher than where we expect it.\n\n---\n\nSo the incremental IT investment, is it just part of the ongoing transition as you move towards more product releases, more of a cloud basis and...\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nYes, we've had very, as you know, double-digit increases in IT investment for many years. And I think what we're saying is it tends to flatten out. We've reached a very good point of the amount of productivity we're getting and the development needs. And that's still a very -- it's become a very large part of our investment. As you would expect with a SaaS-based company that's a very much technology-driven service.\n\n---\n\nAnd last question. If you can help with sort of the relative sizing of various HRS offerings, ballpark.\n\n---\n\nSo the biggest now, certainly, as I say, is HR outsourcing, both ASO, PEO, and what we call our HR Essentials product, which is more telephonic support, HR light, HR outsourcing light. The second is our retirement services business. And then third, insurance, nothing's changed there. Those are all businesses that are growing nicely and performing well within the portfolio.\n\n---\n\nI was hoping you'd put numbers relative to sizing. But okay, maybe you will add better investments.\n\n---\n\nSo your biggest followed by the next biggest, followed by the smallest.\n\n---\n\nAll right. Thank you. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast for this conference call, it will be archived until approximately April 25. We thank you for your interest in Paychex and for your participation on the call. Have a good day.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: David Togut (Analysts)】\nCan you provide a little more detail on the underlying drivers behind the double-digit growth and new annualized revenue as told during the peak selling season, in particular, breakdown between payroll service and HR services bookings?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nWell, David, we don't usually give that much detail on it. But I will tell you that we were strong across the board. I would say both payroll -- all areas of payroll as well as HRS were both very strong and probably the best sales. And we had a pretty good sales we've seen over the last year. But this is probably the best sales results in the selling season we've seen in, I would say, 7 or 8 years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Togut (Analysts)】\nWhat accounts for that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nWell, I think very good execution on the sales side. I also think that the channels that we've been developing from our constant CPA channel has been -- continued to be strong. The bank channel, we picked up a lot from the bank channel from a referral standpoint. We've also added a number of franchise arrangements, where we're the supported or the preferable company per payroll. And I think we've just done a good job overall, also team selling. So going in is not just payroll and then coming back to sell the other ancillary services, but going in right up-front and selling the full value of all the products to the client right up-front. So we've seen good growth in payroll. We've seen good growth in HRS, in the Affordable Care Act products. Our Employer Shared Responsibility product has been strong and certainly HR outsourcing, both PEO and ASO. All have been strong. I think it's execution. I think it's a lot of the work that the Head of Sales, Mark Bottini, has been doing with that team to build a good referral and pipeline as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Togut (Analysts)】\nWith that rate of new annualized recurring revenue growth, taken together with your current client retention trend, point to a change in your revenue growth rate for FY '16 and '17?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nWell, I can't really get into guidance now. I think we'll have a better sense of that at the next quarter to talk about '16. But it certainly bodes well for a start anyway.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Georgios Mihalos (Analysts)】\nI just wanted to start off on the core payroll side, the growth of 2% or I guess, I'm close to like 2.4%, the way we calculate it. But anything else to call out there aside from timing, meaning, was there any sort of slippage maybe on the pricing side, 2Q to 3Q, or a bit of a slower rate of client growth or anything else?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. Good question. So client growth, no. Pricing, no. Checks, a little bit less than we expected. So a little bit of color on that. So we've seen moderation in checks per payroll. We're not calling it out specifically because when it's trending around 1%, it really is not a significant contributor to revenue overall. But what we did see was that checks have just been a little lighter. We're a little bit lighter in the quarter than we anticipated. Now just 2 more points of detail on that. What's interesting about that number is -- again, I ruled out client and I ruled out price, because that's not a driver here. Timing is primarily the reason. But secondarily, what's going on is that even though we saw an increase in the amount of bonus dollars that we paid in checks, that's what we seem to be seeing in the data, we actually saw a slight decrease in the amount of bonus checks. So it looks like people were being paid a little bit more in bonuses. But the size of those bonuses resulted in lower checks. So it was a little bit lighter. And that really kind of drove much of the difference in payroll service revenue. We've accounted for that as we look forward. I think we're just in this environment now where with check per client or check per payroll growth is going to be moderate going forward. So that's some color on that point.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Georgios Mihalos (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just my second question on the prior earnings call, I think you guys talked a little bit about M&A and sort of your appetite to do something there. Just curious what you're seeing out there in the marketplace and if you still have an appetite for I guess what you would consider a large-scale acquisition in addition to any tuck-ins?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, we do. I think there's -- we still see a lot available. We're looking at more than we probably ever have in the past. Everything is pretty highly valued, so we're going to be very selective as to what we do. But we're looking at both something that would be product tuck-ins, but also just add to the base because we think, whether it's PEO, payroll or other services, we think we're pretty effective at what we're -- how we're executing and it's a good time to acquire. We may not find something, but we're pretty deep into a number of things we're looking at, at the time, so -- and size would be -- we'd be very selective, but we certainly have the cash to do it if that makes sense.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Georgios Mihalos (Analysts)】\nAnd just to be clear, you're going to be sticking to your knitting, so sort of a payroll acquisition or something in that area or in HRS services? You'll not going into any sort of other areas?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. Yes, that's correct.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ryan Cary (Analysts)】\nThis is Ryan Cary calling in for Jason. I just want to build on, on George's question. Although you reiterated the full year guide of 3% to 5% for the payroll services, has your outlook on where you might fall on that range changed at all after this quarter? Meaning, do you expect 4Q to make up for any of the moderate softness or a little bit below that range that we saw in 3Q?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nWhen we issued guidance, we expect to be somewhere around the middle. For the year, I think that's where we're at right now.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ryan Cary (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And did you see any material changes in the competitive environment as you got deeper into the peak calendar year-end selling season? And I have to ask a question on pricing as well. Last quarter you seemed comfortable pricing would stand at say 2% to 4% band. Has there been any material change in either direction over the last quarter? Just would love any additional color?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. Ryan, I don't think so. We didn't really see -- because actually we feel very good about the quarter from a selling perspective. I would say the competitive environment was about the same. Didn't see any extra pricing pressure. There's always competitive pricing pressure out there. But we didn't see anything pick up necessarily. There was no big competitor plans or things that they were doing that we saw that made any big difference there. So I'd say pricing is generally holding like we thought it was last quarter and competitive environment's about the same.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Ridley-Lane (Analysts)】\nSure. Efrain, you mentioned that payroll service revenue was being deferred from third quarter into fourth quarter. Now that you're through the third quarter, can you give us a sense of magnitude of that -- and this is David Ridley-Lane for Sara Gubins.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, I thought it was you, David. David, I think it's implicit in what I said that we expect to be somewhere in the middle of the range. If you heard my comments earlier, I said that fourth quarter was going to be comparable to the first half of the year, and I kind of leave it at that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Ridley-Lane (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then could we get an update on the sensitivity of the portfolio to the first 25 or 50 basis points of interest rate increase?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. On the short-term it's going to be about $4 million, somewhere in that range, it could be a little bit less, a little bit more. And that just assumes the short-term reprices. What that does to long-term rates is a good question. I don't have a crystal ball on that. And timing at this point, our best guesstimate is Q2. But again, our crystal ball has been exceedingly fuzzy.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Smittipon Srethapramote (Analysts)】\nI just have a couple of follow-up questions on the minimum premium plan. Maybe you can talk about how the claims have trended versus your expectations and whether you've gotten any closer throwing out this offering to more states?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. So I would say that claims experienced thus far has been about what we expected. We're pretty conservative in terms of our approach and takes kind of a belt-and-suspenders view from an actuarial perspective. We had 2 actuaries look at it and have pretty extensive conversations about how we set prices. I think one thing that I'd just like to reiterate from our perspective, the PEO is not an insurance play. It's an HR outsourcing play. So we understand the perils of selling cheap insurance in the PEO and it's not a direction we want to go in. So I think claims have trended about where we expected them to be. I didn't get -- I forgot the second half of your question, Smitti.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Smittipon Srethapramote (Analysts)】\nJust can you give us an update in terms of your plans relative to offering to do more states?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. At this point, we're still getting through kind of a full year of this one. We feel very good about it. As Efrain said, I think we've done very well on the claims and so forth, but it's a year into it. And we don't have any immediate plans to expand it outside of the area. But that is where a big amount of our sales are. So I think we'll give it a little bit more experience before we look to expand it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Smittipon Srethapramote (Analysts)】\nAnd on -- this is just following along on a minimum plan. Can you talk about how the client ramp has looked like over the past year and whether you switched existing clients over or whether it's really new clients signing up for the product?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nIt's primarily new clients that were signing up. When you -- when we initially did it, we obviously moved existing clients onto the plan. Now what we're doing is we're selling new clients. I would say PEO client base is growing nicely, double-digit. So I would -- one thing I hope we're not leaving the impression that it's the minimum premium plan driving PEO growth. It really is that there is a lot of interest in the market now for bundled HR outsourcing solutions plus -- that it also includes healthcare and that's driving the market.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy McHugh (Analysts)】\nCan you help us contrast the double-digit growth in annualized new sales? I guess what was that growth number a year or 2 ago? How much of an improvement is that versus what you've seen in the last couple of years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nWell, I would say it certainly gone from single digit, fairly flat actually, to single digit to now double-digit growth in par with annualized revenue. And so it's -- this is, as I said, I think this is probably the best selling season we've seen in 7 or 8 years. So I think very good execution. I think it's much stronger than last year, which was pretty good. And it's -- as I said, it's pretty much across the board. So it's not just PEO and the HRS services. It's a good team selling. We're seeing good both payroll and HR outsourcing, 401(k) really across the board. I think this is very good execution. And I do think, obviously, that the market's coming back a little bit from a small business and midsize business environment too. So I'd say how I'd characterize it, Tim, as best in 7 or 8 years from an increase standpoint from a total par standpoint.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy McHugh (Analysts)】\nLast year was improved, but that was still kind of mid-single digits last year even?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nIt was in single digits. I wouldn't characterize it as mid-single digits.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy McHugh (Analysts)】\nOkay. And does it change your thoughts on -- I think you've talked about trying to get unit growth or client growth back up to kind of somewhere in the 1% to 3% range. Where's your thoughts on that as you, I guess, exit the selling season based on what you saw?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nWell, it's still a combination. I mean, we want the units and the revenue both, and that's the way our comp plans and our incentives are set. So we're still looking for both, and we're still trying to -- we certainly expect to be in that range from a client growth perspective.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Timothy McHugh (Analysts)】\nBut you want to be -- I guess, I was trying to see if you would increase that range, given the sales season or if it's a -- so in other words, I guess, if you still would say 1% to 3%?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I would still stay in that range from client growth perspective. I think this is an ability to sell higher revenue per client as much as product. It is selling more complete bundles to clients and more complete and more ancillary services as well. And so I think the client growth would still be in that same range. It wouldn't necessarily bring that up. But I think we're selling more revenue per client because of the better execution, the team selling, et cetera.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nEfrain, you talked a little bit about the float. Are we at a point now -- if we assume that rates stay kind of where they are and don't worry about increases, that float income year-over-year should be flat and if rates go up that you can start seeing an increase there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, I think you should see it tick up modestly. Yes, I think that's where we're at. We've kind of -- we weathered the storm, and the storm appears to have passed. Hopefully, we're not in the eye of something. But it's -- it seems to be that the worst certainly has passed. And from the perspective of the portfolio and how we will manage it, interest rates now just represent an upside, as I'd like to say, the embedded optionality of the stock.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nAnd Marty, you talked a little bit about price increases and this quarter you haven't seen really any increased competition. Now as you look at the next price increase, which I think you usually do some time in the May time frame, anything changed in the environment which would change your mind as to the type of price increase that you would do this fiscal year compared to what you were able to do the current fiscal year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nNo, I think we'd still be in that same range. I think we've gotten more sophisticated as to kind of where we put the price increase based on clients, products and the competitive nature of those products with the portfolio of different products we have. But I still think you'd expect us to be in that -- you should expect us to be in that 2% to 4% range.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kartik Mehta (Analysts)】\nAnd then just one last question. Efrain, you alluded to this a little bit when you were talking about the PEO. And I'm wondering, is there a way to quantify any ACA benefits you're getting and if that benefit goes away next year. Or is the PEO, at least the way you look at it, and the HRS business, the trends are fairly strong, so we should continue to kind of see the growth you've been witnessing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nMy initial answer to that is that I would expect a continuation of trends. Having said that, we are going through the planning process and having our usual discussions with sales about what we think is attainable. I think we're -- it's fair to say we're in a favorable environment. How we set that for next year's plans still remains to be decided.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gary Bisbee (Analysts)】\nJust going back to the minimum premium plan for one more question. Can you give us a sense, is that growing much more quickly than other PEO? And I guess now that we've annualized you adding that, I'm trying to think, will that be growing faster and thus be somewhat of a drag on margins even though there's little profit impact for several more quarters? Or is most of that behind you now that you've lapped the introduction of that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nI think next quarter is when it will pretty much anniversary, Gary. So we'll see a little bit of drag into next quarter. And then starting the following quarter, it should be a more fair compare. But the point you're making is a fair one. To the extent that more PEO clients attach health care, it does have a slight drag on margins simply because we don't get much of a margin flow through. But after fourth quarter, it shouldn't be significant.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gary Bisbee (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then I think we all know PEO is, because of the past, there is this somewhat lower margin. But when you look at the mix of new business, and just the composition of your growth in the last year or 2 and going forward, how do we think about the puts and takes around margins? Is stuff -- a lot of stuff coming in at a lower margin or some of it is add-on, is that just incrementally more profitable for existing customers? What are the main issues?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. So Gary, that's a good question. The answer is, if you look at most of HRS with the exclusion -- exception of PEO, if I take all of those products, they are all growing pretty strongly and they all have margins that are comparable to payroll. One exception to that is insurance. But it's still too small to exert and an overall drag on margin. So the answer is we shouldn't see significant dilution. There may be a moderate impact if PEO really, really starts to grow much faster than everything else. It's been growing nicely. But it's part of the mix and it's reflected in our results. So unless that really took off, it shouldn't have a significant impact on overall margins.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gary Bisbee (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then just one last one. Last time, the company got north of $1 billion of net cash and corporate investment, there was a sizable buyback. I think it seems like you've been more likely to do some steady buybacks over time rather than the one big dip. So I wondered if you've given any thought to maybe a special dividend or some other way of earning more quick proportion of that excess cash.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. So we -- I guess my nuanced answer to that is that when it's above $1 billion, we have to think about what we do with it. And it's a function of where we are with respect to opportunities within the M&A portfolio. So to the extent we don't see those materializing in a shorter-term time frame, then we have to have that conversation with the board. And they're ultimately going to decide what makes sense. But we'll be having those conversations.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Macdonald (Analysts)】\nOn the double-digit new bookings growth, do you think we'll see that more in HR or somewhat in payroll? Or how's that going to lay out?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think both of them are pretty strong, but I think it's a little stronger in the HR side. That's obviously where we have more opportunity to sell the ancillary, the wide breadth of ancillary products that we have. So a little bit stronger on the HR side, particularly, as Efrain said, between PEO, ASO, 401(k), our online services, time and attendance and everything -- kind of everything but payroll is in there. So I think it's certainly been a little stronger on the HR side, but both have been good.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nAnd I'd say this, Jim, that Marty mentioned it was double digit. It was in the fourth quarter double -- I'm sorry, fourth quarter -- third quarter, it was in double digit in payroll. So to Marty's point, we were pretty strong across the board.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Macdonald (Analysts)】\nGreat. And this I think is similar to other questions. But as people continue to adopt the minimum premium plan, will you continue to get a little bit of a tailwind in revenue growth that you sort of had this year from the new revenue recognition?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. That's a good question. You really don't see as much of it next year. We really obviously got a -- there are 2 things. We obviously got an uplift this year. We've been careful to call it out because we don't want people to misunderstand what's going on in the underlying numbers and most people understand it. We were within $3 million of what The Street had on revenue. So everyone understands kind of what's going on. You get a modest tick-up. But after this year, the impact is not significant.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Macdonald (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just one sort of thing. On the repurchase, your share count kind of started to drift back up again. Any thoughts on that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. I wish the share count didn't drift up. Yes, we will -- I would say we'll repurchase opportunistically. I think that's where we're at right now. Before -- I think Gary's question earlier on would we do something more, we'll have to take a look at where we are with M&A and address whether we think something larger is warranted.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Evan Bull (Analysts)】\nThis is Evan Bull on for Bryan. Just real quick on the bookings growth in the December and January quarters. Just maybe directionally, was that ahead of your expectations, below or right at, just kind of given the magnitude of those months.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think it was pretty close to our expectations. I mean, we set pretty high goals for the sales team and what we expected particularly in selling season. I'd say it was pretty much at our expectations because we set pretty high ones.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Evan Bull (Analysts)】\nSure, that helps. And then you guys have introduced a number of SaaS-based products over the course of the past year. Can you just maybe talk about the traction with those products and then maybe the competition and kind of the competitive dynamic there? Aside from ADP, who else are the players that you're kind of competing with directly?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. I always hate the name competitors because it just gives them credibility. I think ADP is the one we run into the most. There's a couple of other that have recently gone through IPOs you run into. But we're winning some of those clients back actually right now over service issues and so forth. So I think from a product standpoint, we stand up very competitively. And all SaaS, the ability of the SaaS products and the bundling of these and the integration is so critical to us. And we're continuing, you'll see over the next 6 months, to really even more fully integrate a lot of kind of, I think, the kind of best-in-class products. So we have myStaffingPro, for example, which is sold and integrated. But it will see even better integration this year as well as stratustime, which is I think the leading time-and-attendance SaaS offering that we purchased last June. And now you'll see it. Not only is it integrated now, but it will go much more of a full integration. So we compete very well. It's still primarily with ADP. And then there's some of the pays that we call them that you'll see, but again, we're starting to win those back. They're pretty small losses for them at this stage.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Siva Borra (Analysts)】\nThanks for taking my question. First one is probably just on the timing impact. You guys talk about double-digit growth you're seeing in bookings, how long does it take to actually see that from a revenue side?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYou'll start to see that probably a couple of quarters out. That's when -- so the first quarter, not much. Depending on where it occurred, you start to get the client set up. There's a little bit of time. And then probably after the second quarter, that's when you're starting to see the impact.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Siva Borra (Analysts)】\nOkay. Probably if you could provide some color on some of the new products, which you guys have launched over the last few quarters. PEO, I understand it's at a lower margin profile on the group level. But just thinking about these newer products, are there any products or services which are at higher margin than the group level?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI'd say, as Efrain mentioned earlier, most of the products are at a pretty strong margin level across the board. I think insurance, Efrain mentioned, was pretty strong margin and -- but that's still a small part of the business, although the insurance, the health insurance in particular, workers' comp has always been pretty strong. The health insurance is really starting to pick up now. And that's in addition to the Affordable Care Act products that we have. I think our -- as a business, we work very hard to make sure we have the strongest margins possible obviously with our high margins in the industry now and we keep trying to drive those. But I think when you look at the newer products that we've either purchased or built, stratustime from a time-and-attendance SaaS product, myStaffingPro from a recruitment and applicant tracking product, BeneTrac, the benefit enrollment, all of those will have pretty good margins particularly as we build scale and more fully integrate them into the bundle. So all those products are doing well and they're getting out of the gate. And this is even before we more fully integrate them into the Paychex Flex, our SaaS -- kind of a SaaS base for the whole thing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Siva Borra (Analysts)】\nAnd probably just last one regarding float income. Yes, there's some positive comments coming from Fed, and you might end up seeing some positive impact from that. But just from a long-term strategy around your portfolio, would you be open to considering options like small business lending, given your strong distribution strength and strong customer base?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nTo answer your question, S.K., we have that discussion probably I would say once a quarter. The challenge we see there -- so we're looking at ways to partner. We do partner with Biz2Credit on small business loans and our referral arrangement. We're just very cautious about tiptoeing into an area that could be highly regulated. So that's why we've been cautious about doing it. It's an area of interest. If we could participate a little bit more fully, we'd look at it. But that's the inhibitor.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Silber (Analysts)】\nEfrain, not to nitpick here, but in looking at the supplemental schedule, if I look at the operating margin guidance for the fourth quarter, 35% to 36%, I think last quarter, that number was 36% to 37%. Is there something going on that we should be aware of?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, I think, Jeff, so what -- first of all, eagle eyes there. I did not call it out except that in my comments, what you saw were -- was some discussion about higher costs in the quarter. And the higher costs were driven by -- primarily by sales-related expense. And so we're just simply calling out that we think, given strong sales performance now, we're moderating a little bit the margin, given the strong sales performance in the back half of the year. That's what's driving that modest change.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jeffrey Silber (Analysts)】\nThat makes sense. And I wish I could take credit for it, but somebody pointed it out to me. Just one other question. You mentioned on the checks per payroll, and I know it's not as big of an issue as it was before and that you expect more normalized growth in the fourth quarter. Is that because of the bonus issue you mentioned that shouldn't really impact the quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. So it's not going to impact the quarter. And I think the timing shifts that I discussed in Q2, these happen from time to time -- I'm sorry, that I mentioned in Q3. That doesn't occur in Q4. And then we're back at a more normalized rate, like what you saw in the first half of the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Grossman (Analysts)】\nI was wondering if you could just step back to the growth in HRS and perhaps help us better understand the ASO versus the PEO and what the trends are you are seeing with the buyers of each of those different products?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. I think primarily the PEO has typically been in states where they're just more comfortable and more used to PEOs and -- but I think what's expanded a little bit from a PEO side, David, is there -- because of the Affordable Care Act, they're looking more to kind of feel more comfortable kind of within a co-employer relationship. So there's a little bit more acceptance, I think, to the PEO in not just the typical states, the Florida, Texas, et cetera, type of states. So we do see that growing. And I think that's been frankly a lot of the Affordable Care Act has pushed more people into seeing the opportunity and just feeling more comfortable being part of a shared kind of employment service. And those who don't need to go that far have the ASO. And both -- I think the ASO's still coming primarily at it from an HR outsourcing type of business. We've seen that drop down. So where clients didn't think about HR outsourcing at 30 employees or 20 employees now do because of the complexity of the regulations of the hiring and firing and other compliance issues. So both are growing. I think PEO still tends to grow a little bit more from thinking -- starting to think about insurance, but then realizing that the HR support is there and that's why they buy totally because that's really how we sell it, as the value of HR support. But the -- and the ASO continues to be HR. And I just think it's so complex now, the Affordable Care Act, there's a number of immigration reform issues that are out there for hiring and so forth. All of these things add more people to say, \"Hey, I want to be -- I want to outsource my HR to somebody who's going to stay current.\" And of course, we've been a leader in this business. We have more client employees than anybody else in the business by far that we service and in -- over 400 individuals around the country, who service the clients face to face. And I think that's made for great growth.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nAnd to build on that, David. I think that when you look at how we are going to market and how we sell that product, ASO tends to be, as Marty mentioned, tends to be a little bit lower typically worksite employees and within the base. PEO tends to be a little bit bigger and a combination of inside the base and outside the base. So our PEO sales are not just to existing Paychex clients but also outside the base.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Grossman (Analysts)】\nAnd is development growth rate, just without getting into specific numbers, are they comparable? And if not, do you expect them to diverge at all over the next couple of years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think they're generally comparable. Yes, they're pretty close on both sides. It's just the preference for what -- how the client thinks. I think the other thing that we probably didn't mention is selling this more up-front, we have found that typically our model was sell them payroll then come back and say, \"Do you need HR services in 3 months or 6 months?\" And we're selling much more up-front. If we think the client is of a 20-plus in their complexity, we will go in and team sell. And I think we're winning more clients right up-front on an ASO or PEO basis.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Grossman (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just one other question. Are you -- do you sell the ancillary services without payroll? And if you don't, have you ever considered doing that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nGood question. So the answer is yes, we do. Although, for example, we reported I believe last year about 580,000 clients, we think we had in excess of 20,000 clients that don't take payroll but take other ancillary products. And I think, David, it points to the fact that the company that we were part of the recession is very different from the company that we emerged out of the recession. We're much more of an integrated full-service provider to small- and medium-sized businesses and you're starting to see that in the client base. And we'll update some of that information when we get to the end of the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nWith regards to the core payroll growth that you've seen, can you characterize where you're seeing the strongest growth in terms of -- is it the smallest end of your client size or just the average small client? And how are -- what are you seeing on the MMS side?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI would say on the average, it's not necessarily the smallest clients, although new business formation has picked up some obviously and we're kind of getting back to where we were pre-recession levels. And I think our -- and our sales to new businesses are back up over last year at this time. And so I think there's some small -- but I think primarily it's net average base, if not slightly higher, I'd say, meaning, 1 or 2 employees or something like that. So I think we're right in the average. And in the mid-market, I think it's about the same. I think we focused very heavily on the 50 to 500 in that mid-market space. And I think that's been a very good sweet spot for us. We certainly have clients that are above that. But we're really focusing the team on that 50 to 500. It's a very hot space right now for multiple products. Those are the clients that need multiple products that are integrated and SaaS-based and we fit really well there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nSo you're seeing the same level of growth in that 50 to 500 as in that sub-20 group?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. I'd say, yes, pretty close, I'd say. Yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nGreat. And do you still have some improvements to make to that 50 to 500 products, is that right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nWell, I think what I mentioned earlier is over the next 6 months, you'll see even stronger integration. So all on the kind of the same user interface and so forth. So they're integrated today from -- at different levels. But over the next 6 months, stratustime that we acquired last year, myStaffingPro and BeneTrac will see even enhanced integration and...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nSo it's a single sign-on, single database?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nMark, just to -- I'm sorry, go ahead.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nWhich will make that even a stronger product right from applicant tracking right through to retirement, as they say, but particularly on the front end of the applicant tracking and the benefit enrollment.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nBuilding on what Marty said, the way we segment the markets, Mark, is under 50 and 50 to 500. We look at it from a unit basis, the growth is pretty comparable.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nOkay. Great. And with regards to the sales that you've seen, can you characterize the number of add-on modules that you're seeing now relative to, say, a year ago?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nAdd-on modules. I guess I'd say we -- if this is what you mean, we sell a lot more bundled services certainly than stand-alone payroll. That's gone up dramatically over the last 4 years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nWhat does dramatically mean?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI'd say from low double digits as a percent to mid almost, okay, double digit kind of. If you think double -- so where we used to sell probably stand-alone payroll -- and this is a change in the whole sales team, probably 10% to 20% of the -- I'm sorry, bundled services right up-front 10% to 20% of the time. Now we're selling a complete bundle probably 40% to 50% of the time. It's pretty dramatic. But it's the way we've bundled the products as well and the way that sales has looked to increase the revenue per client and really to sell the client everything they need right up-front as part of a bundle.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then what percentage of your sales are now coming from brand new businesses?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI'd say it's still close to half. It's still close to that 50%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nOkay. But that is picking up?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then if the economy stays as it is, would you expect your new business revenue growth target to basically stay about the same?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think so, yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. Mark, I think it's really been typically between about 45 and low 50s, 52, 53. It's hard to envision that, that changes that much. I mean, part of what distinguishes us from a lot of companies is that we're mining that new base to get our customers. So we get the 3% payroll and they eventually become an 8%, 10%, 20% payroll because we mine that base. So that's part of the way we sell. How we do that, how we go to market over time may change. But that's really core to how we're approaching the market.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Marcon (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then lastly, this is completely separate from new business formations in terms of a question but just specific to your bookings growth. When we take a look at the target that was set and if the environment stays the same in terms of how you're judged, do you think that your target level will roughly stay the same as what we've recently seen in certain documents?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nOkay. So that's a very wonderfully, elliptical euphemistic way of saying we typically have a pretty tough target. Management doesn't get paid. We don't start having conversations until we're getting close to double digits. So we will expect that we will have a double-digit target. And we will expect that if we don't meet it, we'll suffer the consequences. So that's kind of where we're at from management's comp perspective, obviously, sales has its own set of comp.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Williams (Analysts)】\nSo you had mentioned in the release a couple of things that I thought were interesting, and maybe speak to what's happening in the wider world, specifically regarding, number one, pricing, and number two, just the fact that you're starting to see wages move up a little bit. I was wondering if there's any read that you have perhaps more on the wage side than on the pricing side. You've talked a bit about the pricing side, but I'm curious to know what you're seeing on a wider scale with wage inflation, and if that's something you think is going to become an issue in the next few months?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI think wages we've generally seen around 2%. So I wouldn't say it's anything overly strong. I think we saw -- Efrain I think mentioned earlier from a bonus perspective, which we watched, bonuses were higher. They weren't -- didn't seem to be as many necessarily or isn't much of an increase as we thought, but they were higher. But general wage has been pretty consistent at around 2% increase.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes, I think you're picking up, John, on the 3% client fund balances. And so that incorporates not only wages, but anything else that we're paying. So it looks like it's ticking up moderately.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Ellis (Analysts)】\nCan you comment, just following up on the strong bookings and then also increase in sales expense, can you just give a little bit more color around sales productivity and how that's trending compared to say, growth in the sales force?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, I think we're showing, obviously, good productivity in this third quarter in the selling season from a standpoint of revenue per rep. So we're seeing pretty good productivity there kind of as we projected or set our goals, I guess I'd say. And so that always drives -- when you tie it back to expense in the third quarter because we have a lot of sales in the third quarter with January starts per payroll in particular, that drives the sales expense up. But I would say sales expense kind of per sale is generally consistent with where we thought it would be. And we're continuing to get productivity out of the sales team. I think they're executing very well as you look over the last few years in particular.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Ellis (Analysts)】\nTerrific. And then second one on the ASO and PEO businesses, how much of the growth there is coming from greenfield versus -- and how many of those deals are you seeing that it's competitive or it's actually a take out?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nI would say in the PEO side, I think it's probably 60-40. I haven't seen that number lately. But I would say more new. Just when you think about, it trends tended to be with our overall business. So we're 50% new businesses, I think, if that's what you're asking from a payroll standpoint. I think the PEO is similar to that, maybe a little bit more on the new side. But I think it's right in that range of 50-50.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Ellis (Analysts)】\nTerrific. Okay. And then last one, just a little bit of a longer-term question. You made in your comments up-front, talked a bit about Flex and the health care reform offering and myStaffingPro and then made some comments in response to your question about looking more actively at M&A. Can you just take a step back and give us an idea of looking out 2, 3, 4 years, how you envision the product portfolio evolving?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. I think when you look out, it will be a fully integrated Software-as-a-Service offering, meaning single database UI, very client friendly. Mobility will be tied into it very directly. One of the things we didn't really comment on today just quickly in the comments is mobility. Our mobile app has been continually -- we've added to the mobile app. And it has seen pretty dramatic usage being picked up even more from client employees than clients. And so we're seeing a nice kind of roll up of client employees, which we think will add to retention by the way which will -- because the client employees now will be interfacing with our products and will get -- we have very positive feedback on the mobility. When you look out, it's going to be that single source for our client to come to us for everything, from hire to retire, as they do now. And I think it will just be a very full product set. I think the M&A piece of it is some product tuck-ins were needed. But to be straightforward, we've got pretty much the products that we need. Now it's finishing the full integration of a single database with them this year. And then it will be adding I think where we can execute and add more ability and make the company more efficient, so PEOs, payroll companies, probably 401(k) is always out there and any offshoot of anything from recruiting, et cetera, those kinds of businesses. So those are pretty wide scope that we look at from an M&A perspective. But our job will be to drive upper single-digit revenue growth on the top line and still be one of the most profitable companies in the business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Simmons (Analysts)】\nThis is Robert Simmons on for Joe. So you actually just answered my first question, but what are your thoughts on international expansion?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nWe -- I have been in Germany now for 9 or 10 years. We doubled our size last year with an acquisition and continued sales growth. So we've got a nice base there. Brazil, we started last year. And we're kind of chugging along. It didn't help that the kind of Brazil economy kind of slowed down at the time that we were starting up there. But we're kind of learning there and we're breaking into the business of winning over the CPA so that they'll refer more of their payroll business out to us. We're still very interested in it. We were going to focus on 2 or 3 countries, kind of the third country we haven't quite found a good entryway in yet. We've looked at a number of them. We -- it will always, I think at this point, it tends to be small. It's going to tend to be small part of where we are as we approach $3 billion in revenue. But it's still of interest to us. And we continue to look at acquisition opportunities and ways to increase sales and profit there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew O'Neill (Analysts)】\nI was just hoping you could give us any updates you might be willing to provide on the short payroll business, specifically. And possibly if you could parse the client growth rate of 1% to 3% and the contribution from the SaaS side.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes. Sure. We don't really -- well, SaaS -- most of our products now or most of our clients are on SaaS, so well over 80% of them. From a growth standpoint, we don't break out SurePayroll anymore. But they're doing fine. I mean, really, they've had good client growth year-over-year. And I think they're competing very effectively with particularly the micro businesses for payroll. All of that is done through Web marketing and sales on the phone once people call in. I think they've been very effective at that in growing their client base. And we continue to be pleased with that and continue to always watch who we're competing against. Not a lot of new competitors there. There -- some start-ups got some -- quite a bit of press for a while, but then it's kind of dropped out a little bit because they're not as -- a full product as Sure. And so I think primarily it's Intuit that we run into as a competitor there. And folks just wanting to stay manual, doing their payroll manually.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nAnd the other thing I'd add is -- you'd surf the Web, there's a bunch of these different rating services. But they just won a recent award in terms of user access and appearance. And so they are a very, very formidable competitor and platform in that micro enterprise space.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ashwin Shirvaikar (Analysts)】\nI guess my question is as your bookings roll into revenues, can you talk about sort of -- are there other incremental expenses involved? And then taking that question longer term, just longer-term expense growth assumptions where you're making in less [indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes. Ashwin, so 2 things. In a quarter when we have particularly strong sales execution, then our expenses tend to ramp up. So we had probably a little bit higher expense growth in the quarter and then in the back half of the year, based on the performance we're seeing. Hopefully, obviously, that leads to a little bit better billed revenue going forward. So -- but I don't think it's -- unless we set our plans too low and they constantly beat them, that's not the way we tend to do it. We tend to set them pretty high. And the sales force has done a great job of rising to the challenge. With respect to expense, where we -- I think there's really going to be no change in terms of the approach we take. We're going to leverage operating expenses as much as we can. We're going to continue to invest in IT, probably at a little bit more of the moderate rate than you've seen in past years or where it then has been embedded in the SG&A number, which is where it appears. And then we're going to continue to make selective investments in sales, where we think there's opportunities to grow the business. So I think that will not change dramatically. Quarter-over-quarter, you might have some changes as results are higher than where we expect it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ashwin Shirvaikar (Analysts)】\nSo the incremental IT investment, is it just part of the ongoing transition as you move towards more product releases, more of a cloud basis and...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nYes, we've had very, as you know, double-digit increases in IT investment for many years. And I think what we're saying is it tends to flatten out. We've reached a very good point of the amount of productivity we're getting and the development needs. And that's still a very -- it's become a very large part of our investment. As you would expect with a SaaS-based company that's a very much technology-driven service.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ashwin Shirvaikar (Analysts)】\nAnd last question. If you can help with sort of the relative sizing of various HRS offerings, ballpark.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nSo the biggest now, certainly, as I say, is HR outsourcing, both ASO, PEO, and what we call our HR Essentials product, which is more telephonic support, HR light, HR outsourcing light. The second is our retirement services business. And then third, insurance, nothing's changed there. Those are all businesses that are growing nicely and performing well within the portfolio.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ashwin Shirvaikar (Analysts)】\nI was hoping you'd put numbers relative to sizing. But okay, maybe you will add better investments.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Efrain Rivera (Executives)】\nSo your biggest followed by the next biggest, followed by the smallest.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Mucci (Executives)】\nAll right. Thank you. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast for this conference call, it will be archived until approximately April 25. We thank you for your interest in Paychex and for your participation on the call. Have a good day.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Brandy. Good morning to everyone. This morning's release, we'll review our second quarter and first half fiscal 2015 operating results for the 12- and 24-week periods ended February 15, and our monthly 4-week sales results for the 4-week period ending this past Sunday, March 1.\r\nThe discussions we are having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements except as required by law.\r\nTo begin with, our 12-week second quarter fiscal '15 operating results. As you saw this morning, for the quarter, reported earnings per share came in at $1.35, up 29% from last year's $1.05.\r\nAs noted in this morning's release, this year's net income was positively impacted by a $57 million or $0.13 a share income tax benefit. This was in connection with a portion of the $5 per share special cash dividend paid by the company last month to company 401(k) plan participants.\r\nPartially offsetting this reduction to the income tax line was a $14 million or $0.03 a share income tax charge related to an ongoing overseas income tax matter.\r\nThe net impact of these 2 discrete tax items to our reported second quarter earnings, $1.35 earnings per share, was $43 million or $0.10 a share to the positive. So excluding these 2 items, EPS for the second quarter would have been $1.25 or up 19%.\r\nOther factors that impacted our second quarter when you're comparing year-over-year results, gasoline operations. As was the case in Q1 '15, we benefited from strong margins and profits in our gas business. I'll speak to this a little bit more when I discuss our gross margin.\r\nFX. As compared to a year ago, in Q2 this year, the foreign currencies where we operate weakened versus the U.S. dollar in all countries, but primarily in Canada, Mexico and Japan. This resulted in our foreign earnings in Q2 when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about $32 million pretax or $0.05 a share than those earnings would have been had FX exchange rates been flat year-over-year. So again, another relative weakening of these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.\r\nThird, IT modernization cost. As discussed in each of the past 8 or 10-or-so fiscal quarters, our major IT modernization efforts will continue to negatively impact our SG&A expenses through this year and into next year, and possibly a little beyond, especially as new systems are placed into service and depreciation begins. In Q2, on an incremental year-over-year basis, these costs impacted SG&A by an estimated $22 million or about $0.03 a share.\r\nFourth, stock compensation expense. This was higher year-over-year in the quarter by $14 million or $0.02 a share. While this change --- this charge was about a 4-basis-point hit to SG&A, it was a much smaller year-over-year impact to SG&A this quarter than it was in Q1 when the year-over-year delta was $38 million or $0.06 a share to the negative.\r\nLastly, interest income and other. This number was lower year-over-year in Q2 by $10 million in pretax or $0.02 a share. The decrease primarily related to the revaluation and settlement of U.S. dollar payables, primarily in our Mexico operations. As you know, this line item, if you will, goes back and forth. Sometimes it helps us a little, sometimes it hurts us a little. Under GAAP, these adjustments are recorded to the interest income and other line.\r\nNow in terms of sales for the quarter. Reported sales were up 4.3%, and our 12-week reported comp sales figure was up 2%.\r\nFor the quarter, sales were negatively impacted by significant year-over-year gas price deflation, and this had about a 323-basis-point impact to the number, to the negative and by weakening FX -- foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. This was just under 250 basis points to the negative.\r\nSo excluding gas, our reported 4% U.S. comp sales increase in Q2 would have been plus 8%. Our reported minus 2% international comp, assuming flat year-over-year FX rates, would have been plus 8% as well. Such that total comps, again, reported 2% for the quarter, plus 2%, excluding gas and FX were plus 8% for the quarter on a more normalized basis.\r\nFor our 4-week month of February, which included the last 2 weeks of the fiscal second quarter, reported comps came in at plus 1%, consisting of a plus 2% comp in the U.S., flat international.\r\nSales, again, were negatively impacted by gas price deflation, almost 400 basis points for the month, to the negative, and a weakening FX, just under 300 basis points to the negative. So excluding gas, the plus 2% reported comp for February would have been a plus 7%. The reported flat international comp would have actually been a plus 12%. And there's a little benefit in there from the switch in the Lunar New Year, I believe, that impacted a couple of the Asia countries for us. As such that total company comps, the reported plus 1% for the month would have been a plus 8%, excluding gas, deflation and FX.\r\nIn terms of new openings. After opening 9 new locations in Q1, including 1 relo, we opened no new locations in Q2. All told, that puts our fiscal 2015 openings through the second quarter still at 8 net new locations. And we now operate 670 -- 671 locations around the world.\r\nBetween now and the end of fiscal 2015, we expect to open an additional 20 new locations. Just a couple in Q3, which will end in early to mid-May, and then 18 planned for Q4. Of these 20 additional openings before our August 30 fiscal year-end, 10 are in the U.S., and 10 will be international. So we'll most likely end the fiscal year with 691 total locations.\r\nNow a few of those near the end -- very end of the fiscal year could slip into Q1 of '16. So my guess is that, that additional 20 may be 17, 18, who knows?\r\nAlso this morning, I'll review with you our e-commerce activities; our membership trends and renewal rates; a little more discussion on margins and SG&A in the quarter; our recent $5 a share special cash dividend and the related $1 billion debt offering; and our recent announcement related to the planned changes for our U.S. co-branded credit card offering.\r\nFor our second quarter results. Sales for the quarter -- for the 12 weeks ended February 15 were $26.87 billion, up 4% from last year's $25.76 billion. On a reported comp basis, as I mentioned, Q2 comps were up 2%, but up 8% excluding gas and FX.\r\nNow for the quarter, that reported plus 2% was a combination of an average transaction decrease of a little over minus 3%. But again, taking gas out of that number, then the average transaction increase would have been plus -- taking gas and FX out of that number, the average normalized transaction increase would have been a little over 2% to the positive, and average frequency increase of a little over 5.5%. So year-to-date, shopping frequency is up a little over 5%.\r\nIn terms of sales comparisons by geographic region. For the quarter, in terms of geography, Midwest, Southeast and Northeast regions were the strongest. Internationally, in local currencies, Japan was the weakest, still due -- impacted by cannibalization of 2 units we opened in the last 12 months on a base of -- a total base of only 20 over there; and with Taiwan, Korea and Mexico being strongest in local currency comps.\r\nIn terms of merchandise categories for the quarter. For the second quarter, within food and sundries, overall in the mid-single digits. Candy, meat, deli, beer and wine were the relative standouts.\r\nWithin hardlines, overall in the low-single digits. Departments that were the strongest were tires and electronics. Consumer electronics was up in the mid-single digits.\r\nWithin mid-single digit softlines comps, domestics and apparel were standouts.\r\nAnd in fresh foods, where comps were in the high singles, meat showed the best results, although impacted by inflation there.\r\nFor February, traffic was up again 5%, while average transaction on a reported basis was down 3.5%. But again, getting really impacted by FX and even weaker gas year-over-year.\r\nGas prices during the month -- 4-week month of February year-over-year, the average price of gasoline is almost down by 3.5 -- 31.5%.\r\nIn terms of geography. Midwest, Southeast and Bay Area regions were the strongest during February. And internationally, in local currencies, Taiwan and Korea were the strongest. As I previously -- a I mentioned previously, the shift in the Lunar New Year holiday from January to February negatively impact January comps and positively impact February comps for the company probably about 50 basis points each way.\r\nFrom a merchandising categories -- merchandise category standpoint, x FX, food and sundries overall for the month was in the mid-single-digit range. Hardlines overall came in to the mid- to low-single digits, which was consistent with what electronics did during February. Softlines was up in the mid-single-digit range. And finally, fresh foods up nicely in the low-teens overall, with meat being the strongest. And again, as I mentioned, see quite a bit of inflation in that area.\r\nMoving on to the line items down the income statement. Membership fees were up 4 basis points and up 6% from $550 million a year ago in the quarter to $582 million or up $32 million. Take out FX, the up 6% in dollars would have been up 9%.\r\nIn terms of membership. We continue to enjoy strong renewal rates. Our U.S. and Canada renewal rates still is at 91%. I think just a shade under that. We're averaging up to 91%. And for the first time, our fully captured worldwide rate is rounding up to 88% instead of down to 87%.\r\nContinued increasing penetration of Executive member, of course, help us as well as those numbers tend to be the most loyal. New membership sign-ups in Q2 company-wide were up 9%.\r\nIn terms of members at Q2 end. In terms of Gold Star, we ended Q2 with 32.7 million members, up from 32.0 million, up about -- a little under 700,000 from the end of the first quarter 12 weeks earlier.\r\nPrimary Business inched up from 6.9 million to 7.0 million. Add-on remained at 3.5 million.\r\nSo total member households, 42.5 million at the end of Q1 and 43.2 million at the end of Q2. And representing total cardholders going from 77.5 million to 78.7 million over the 12-week fiscal quarter.\r\nAt Q2 end, on February 15, Paid Executive memberships were a shade over 15.4 million, which was an increase of 188,000 during the quarter or about 15,000 a week. And that's both new member sign-ups as well as conversions.\r\nThe Executive members, as I mentioned before, a little over 2/3 of our -- about 2/3 of our membership base -- a little over 2/3 of our membership base and just about 2/3 of our sales. I'm sorry, about 1/3 of our membership base and about 2/3 of our sales.\r\nIn terms of renewal rates. They continued strong. Again, from business renewal -- business member renewal rates at Q1 end was 94.5%. It tweaked up to 94.6% at the end of Q2. Gold Star was 89.8%, inched up to 89.9%. And total was -- remained at a 90.7%. And worldwide, the 87.3% went to an 87.9%.\r\nYou'll see a little bit bigger increase there because when you start at a lower base that tends to improve a little bit faster in those first few years.\r\nNow I'll comment on this past Monday's press release regarding Costco entering into long term co-brand credit card agreement with Citi and our acceptance and co-brand agreement with Visa.\r\nAs the press release stated, we've entered into a new co-branded credit card agreement with Citi and an acceptance and co-brand incentive agreement with Visa. These agreements are subject to the purchase from American Express of the existing co-brand credit card portfolio by Citi and would be implemented -- wouldn't be implemented until next April 1, 2016, at the end of our current co-brand arrangement.\r\nWhile there's not a lot of specifics I can give you at this point, I can tell you the following: once issued, the new co-brand Costco Visa credit card will be accepted throughout the United States and Puerto Rico; the new rewards-based card will be fees free -- fee free; the new card will, needless to say, provide generous rewards to Costco members utilizing the new card. And again, I can't tell you a lot of specifics about that, but we certainly look forward to telling you and our members more about it, but not -- but it probably is not going to be until several months down the road this calendar year\r\nThe new card, of course, will also serve as the members' Costco membership card. Again, there's not a lot of detail we can give you at this point. Needless to say, what we do is ultimately for the long-term benefit of our company and our members, in this case, the co-brand credit card holders as well.\r\nGoing down the gross margin line. Gross margin were up 54 basis points on a reported basis from 10.53% to 11.07%. As I always ask you to do, I'll ask you to jot down 4 columns and 6 line items. The columns, of course, will be Q1 '15, both reported and without gas deflation, and then the columns 3 and 4 would be Q2 '15 reported and without gas deflation.\r\nAnd going across those line items, the first one is core merchandise. And reported in Q1 was minus 6 basis points year-over-year; without gas deflation was minus 13. In Q2, reported was plus 10; without gas deflation was minus 20. Ancillary, plus 22 and plus 20 in Q1; and plus 46 and plus 49 (sic) [ 39 ] in Q2. 2% Reward, minus 1 and minus 1; and then minus 5 and minus 2. LIFO, plus 1 and plus 1; and then in Q2, plus 3 and plus 3. And then Other, plus 6 and plus 7 in Q1; and 0 and 0 in Q2. All told, in Q1 last -- Q1 '15 year-over-year to Q1 '14, we had a reported gross margin improvement of 22, which is the sum of those line items in column 1. On a gas-neutral basis, it was plus 14. Again, reported for this quarter was plus 54. And on a gas-neutral basis, excluding gas deflation, was a plus 20.\r\nNow as you can see, again, our overall gross margin was up by plus 54 and even at plus 20 without gas deflation. Again, a lot of this has to do with gas sales penetration, which were way up as well, even though with a lower price per gallon.\r\nOur core merchandise gross margin was up 10 basis points year-over-year. But again, excluding gas, you see in this chart, it was down 20. Again, this is a function of both increased sales penetration and strong gross margins with our gas business.\r\nIf you look at the core gross margins as a percent of the various departments of their own sales -- and then when I talk about core, I'm talking about food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, which account for about 80-plus percent of our total sales -- on their own sales, they were down year-over-year by 3 basis points in the second quarter, with food and sundries and hardlines being up year-over-year a little and softlines and fresh foods being down a little.\r\nFrankly, margins are fine. We're driving sales. And certainly, gas prices give us plenty of room to be -- to continue to be aggressive. Although with gas prices going up the other way right now, we're -- you don't expect to see those kind of outsized gas profits in the next quarter.\r\nAncillary and other business gross margin was up 46 on a reported basis, 39 without gas deflation. Again, our gas business accounted for nearly 2/3 of this Q2 year-over-year increase. But we also showed higher year-over-year margins in optical, hearing aids and pharmacy.\r\nThe impact of the increasing Executive membership was good. It hit margins by 5 basis points or 2 basis points without gas deflation. And again, that's, that 2% Reward feature. This just generally reflects continued increased sales penetration of the Executive members, which, again, as I mentioned, buy more and are more loyal and shop more frequently.\r\nLIFO in the second quarter. We recorded a $4 million credit pretax compared to a $5 million pretax charge last year, so about $0.01 a share -- $0.01 a share or 3-basis-points benefit year-over-year for $9 million to the gross margin.\r\nMoving on to SG&A. Our SG&A percentage Q2-over-Q2 was higher or worse by 11 basis points, coming in at 9.94% this year versus a 9.90% -- 9.83% last year. Again, we'll do the same 4 columns, reported and without gas impact Q1 '15, then columns 3 and 4, Q2 '15, both reported and without gas.\r\nFive line items, first one is core operations or just operations. Plus 8 basis points was reported in Q1. That mean -- plus here is a positive, meaning lower year-over-year, plus 15 without gas deflation; in Q2 was a plus 3 and a plus 29. Central, minus 1 and minus 1; and in Q2, minus 10 and minus 7, so higher year-over-year in that row. Stock compensation, minus 11 and minus 11; and then minus 4 and minus 3. There are no quarterly adjustments, so the last line item would be total. Again, we reported a minus -- a higher -- minus 4 -- year-over-year SG&A higher by 4 basis points in Q1, both on a reported -- on a reported basis plus 4 or lower by 4 basis points in Q1 without gas deflation. Again, in Q2, higher or minus 11 basis points and then better or lower by 19 basis points or a plus 19 basis points without gas deflation.\r\nNow a little editorial on SG&A here. Again, the operations component of SG&A was better by 3 in Q2 on a reported basis and better by 29 year-over-year, excluding gas deflation. Again, gasoline sales penetration and very low SG&A in the gas business certainly helps that number.\r\nWithin operations, excluding gas and other warehouse businesses, so taking all that out, payroll and benefits represented an improvement of 16 basis points of this 29-basis-point improvement. So again, strong sales overall certainly helped us improve payroll and benefits as well and get some leverage there.\r\nCentral expense was higher year-over-year by 10 or 7 without gas inflation (sic) [ deflation ]. As I mentioned earlier, increased IT spending for our modernization. This was a 7 basis points on a reported basis, 5 basis points without deflation and FX. And lastly, in both years, we had a few discrete items to the tune of about minus 5 basis points, but that is what it is.\r\nFinally, within SG&A, our stock compensation expense, as I mentioned, was higher or worse by 4 basis points on a reported basis, 3 without gas deflation.\r\nNext on the income statement line, preopening expense. $8 million last year and $9 million this year. Last year, we had 3 openings. This year, we had no openings, but we've got plenty of openings coming up. So you've got quite a bit of preopening expense really starting, and there's lots of other little things that go into that number. No real surprises.\r\nAll told, operating income for Q2 came in at 877 -- $877 million, 21% higher year-over-year or higher by $153 million compared to last year's $724 million in the quarter.\r\nBelow the operating income line. Reported interest expense was essentially the same year-over-year, coming in at $26 million last year and $27 million this year.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, interest income and other was lower by $10 million, coming in last year in the quarter of $30 million to the positive; this year, only $20 million to the positive. Actual interest income for the quarter was higher by $3 million. The other swing was a minus $13 million. And again, most of that relates to year-over-year swings in various FX things. In this case, I think the biggest piece was the revaluation settlement of dollar payables -- U.S. dollar payables, primarily in our Mexico operations. I think that was a small positive last quarter.\r\nOverall, pretax income was higher by 20% or up $142 million from $728 million last year in the quarter to $870 million this year.\r\nIn terms of income taxes. Our company tax rate this quarter came in at a -- needless to say, on a reported basis, at a very low 30.2% versus 35.0% last year. Again, the income tax line benefited primarily from a $57 million tax benefit in connection with the special cash dividend.\r\nDividends paid on Costco shares held by our employees in our 401(k) plan, which total about 29 million shares, are deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. And we recognized a onetime income tax benefit of approximately $57 million related to that. As I mentioned, there was an offset to that benefit of about $14 million after-tax charge to the income tax line related to an ongoing income tax matter.\r\nExcluding 2 -- these 2 items, our Q2 tax rate this year was actually up -- would have been up 0.1% to 35.1%, just slightly higher compared to last year's 35.0% on a normal basis.\r\nOverall, reported net income was $463 million last year compared to a reported $598 million in net income this year. Again, this year's net income on a reported basis was up 28%, 29%. Taking out those 2 tax items, up about 19%.\r\nFor a quick rundown of other topics. The balance sheet is included in the morning's press release, a couple of balance sheet information items. Depreciation and amortization for Q2 totaled $260 million in the quarter and $514 million year-to-date.\r\nAccounts payable ratio, accounts payable as a percent of inventories, on a reported basis has shown improvement year-over-year from a 93% to a 97%. There's a lot of construction payables in that. It showed a comparable improvement from an 83%, if you just do merchandise -- accounts payable as a percent of merchandise inventories -- merchandise accounts payable as a percent of merchandise inventories, 83% last year up to 87% this year in the quarter.\r\nAverage inventory per warehouse was darn near flat, coming in at $12.8 million this year on average per warehouse, up about $20,000 compared to a year ago. So pretty much flat. x FX, year-over-year inventory was -- levels were up -- would have been up about $350,000 or about 2.7% of sales on, again, an 8% sales increase. So I think good control of our inventories. And inventory is in good shape. Our mid-year fiscals came in just fine because of the inventories.\r\nI'll respond at this point to questions received in the past few months about the work slowdowns. As you know, in the West Coast ports, there's -- 1.5 weeks ago, I guess, there was a new agreement. So things are getting back to order, although the view is it will take 4 to 8 weeks, if not a little longer, to get through the back up there. We, like, I'm sure, every other employer of containers are trying to identify which ones have priority where we can. And really, pretty much the impact of that's over.\r\nWhen we talk to our head -- our heads of merchandising in the different areas, their view is, in Q2, we might -- probably got hit by $100 million, $200 million. Nothing to really speak of in terms of sales. And it's probably a little worse for some others out there.\r\nIn terms of CapEx. In Q1, we spent $555 million on CapEx. In Q2, we spent $619 million. So quarter-to-date, just under $1.2 billion. For the year, we still expect to be somewhere in the $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion range, which is up from $2.0 billion last year.\r\nIn terms of Costco Online. We continue to operate it in the 4 countries: U.S., Canada, U.K. and Mexico. We're also doing things, not really online, but through Alibaba Tmall in Asia. But in terms of the 4 countries online, there's costco.com. Sales and profits, needless to say, were up during the quarter. Sales were up 23% in the quarter. Comp sales in the U.S. were similarly up right around 23%. Foreign sales in the other 3 countries were up, on a local currency basis, 20-and-more percent as well. But again, with the currencies being down, there's some impact there. But overall, continued good results and sales strengthen on our dot-com efforts.\r\nIn terms of expansion. As I mentioned, we plan in Q3 to open 3 units, including 1 relocation, so net of 2; and have current plans for 19, which includes 1 relo, so net of 18 new in Q4.\r\nAssuming we opened those, we'd be at 28 net new units for the year or about 4.5% square footage growth. And by country, assuming we get to 28, it would be 17 in the U.S., so a little under 2/3 there; 1 in Canada; 1 in the U.K.; 5 in Asia; 1 in Korea; 1 in Taiwan; and 3 in Japan; as well as 1 in Australia; and 3 new in Mexico. As of Q2 end, total square footage stood at 96.4 million square feet.\r\nIn terms of stock buybacks. In Q1, as you know, we started the process, have bought a little bit. We bought $18 million worth or 139,000 shares at an average price of $120 -- a little over $126 a share. In Q2, we expended $92 million to buy 642,000 shares at an average price of $143.21. Now a bunch of that was done before the dividend date, the $5 ex-dividend date.\r\nIn terms of dividends. Our quarter -- our current quarterly dividend stands at $0.355 a share or $1.42 per share annualized. That represents a total cost to the company of about $630 million.\r\nThis regular dividend, of course, was in addition to the $5 per share dividend, which amounted to $2.2 billion that we paid out last -- on February 27. And in fact, both dividends were paid to shareholders on February 27.\r\nAs I mentioned, we also completed a 1 -- to pay in part for the $2.2 billion special dividend, we did a $1 billion debt offering a few weeks back. That $500 million of 5-year fixed and $500 million of 7-year fixed at attractive market rates.\r\nLastly, just a couple of other items of note. The March comp sales reporting period for this year will include 34 selling days versus -- which is 1 day less than the 35 days last year, reflecting the calendar shift of the Easter holiday.\r\nAnd in addition, beginning next month, we'll report -- we'll start reporting comp sales 1 day earlier than we have historically done. So March comp sales will be announced on Wednesday, April 8, after the market close, around 6 p.m. Pacific time and 9 p.m. Eastern time. Hopefully, that will help our East Coast friends.\r\nAnd similarly, our Q3 scheduled earnings release date will be Wednesday, May 27, for the 12-week third quarter ending May 10. Again, the release will occur at 6 p.m. Pacific time, 9 p.m. Eastern time that Wednesday, with the earnings conference call still occurring the following morning.\r\nBefore I turn the call back to Brandy for Q&A, hopefully, I've helped everyone understanding some of the factors impacting the number. Overall, I think, we had -- and certainly, the outsized gas profits helped, but there are lots of other little things that went the other way. So overall, still we felt pretty good a quarter and certainly strong sales, membership renewal rates and the like.\r\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Brandy for any Q&A. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nThank you, Brandy. Good morning to everyone. This morning's release, we'll review our second quarter and first half fiscal 2015 operating results for the 12- and 24-week periods ended February 15, and our monthly 4-week sales results for the 4-week period ending this past Sunday, March 1.\r\nThe discussions we are having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements except as required by law.\r\nTo begin with, our 12-week second quarter fiscal '15 operating results. As you saw this morning, for the quarter, reported earnings per share came in at $1.35, up 29% from last year's $1.05.\r\nAs noted in this morning's release, this year's net income was positively impacted by a $57 million or $0.13 a share income tax benefit. This was in connection with a portion of the $5 per share special cash dividend paid by the company last month to company 401(k) plan participants.\r\nPartially offsetting this reduction to the income tax line was a $14 million or $0.03 a share income tax charge related to an ongoing overseas income tax matter.\r\nThe net impact of these 2 discrete tax items to our reported second quarter earnings, $1.35 earnings per share, was $43 million or $0.10 a share to the positive. So excluding these 2 items, EPS for the second quarter would have been $1.25 or up 19%.\r\nOther factors that impacted our second quarter when you're comparing year-over-year results, gasoline operations. As was the case in Q1 '15, we benefited from strong margins and profits in our gas business. I'll speak to this a little bit more when I discuss our gross margin.\r\nFX. As compared to a year ago, in Q2 this year, the foreign currencies where we operate weakened versus the U.S. dollar in all countries, but primarily in Canada, Mexico and Japan. This resulted in our foreign earnings in Q2 when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about $32 million pretax or $0.05 a share than those earnings would have been had FX exchange rates been flat year-over-year. So again, another relative weakening of these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.\r\nThird, IT modernization cost. As discussed in each of the past 8 or 10-or-so fiscal quarters, our major IT modernization efforts will continue to negatively impact our SG&A expenses through this year and into next year, and possibly a little beyond, especially as new systems are placed into service and depreciation begins. In Q2, on an incremental year-over-year basis, these costs impacted SG&A by an estimated $22 million or about $0.03 a share.\r\nFourth, stock compensation expense. This was higher year-over-year in the quarter by $14 million or $0.02 a share. While this change --- this charge was about a 4-basis-point hit to SG&A, it was a much smaller year-over-year impact to SG&A this quarter than it was in Q1 when the year-over-year delta was $38 million or $0.06 a share to the negative.\r\nLastly, interest income and other. This number was lower year-over-year in Q2 by $10 million in pretax or $0.02 a share. The decrease primarily related to the revaluation and settlement of U.S. dollar payables, primarily in our Mexico operations. As you know, this line item, if you will, goes back and forth. Sometimes it helps us a little, sometimes it hurts us a little. Under GAAP, these adjustments are recorded to the interest income and other line.\r\nNow in terms of sales for the quarter. Reported sales were up 4.3%, and our 12-week reported comp sales figure was up 2%.\r\nFor the quarter, sales were negatively impacted by significant year-over-year gas price deflation, and this had about a 323-basis-point impact to the number, to the negative and by weakening FX -- foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. This was just under 250 basis points to the negative.\r\nSo excluding gas, our reported 4% U.S. comp sales increase in Q2 would have been plus 8%. Our reported minus 2% international comp, assuming flat year-over-year FX rates, would have been plus 8% as well. Such that total comps, again, reported 2% for the quarter, plus 2%, excluding gas and FX were plus 8% for the quarter on a more normalized basis.\r\nFor our 4-week month of February, which included the last 2 weeks of the fiscal second quarter, reported comps came in at plus 1%, consisting of a plus 2% comp in the U.S., flat international.\r\nSales, again, were negatively impacted by gas price deflation, almost 400 basis points for the month, to the negative, and a weakening FX, just under 300 basis points to the negative. So excluding gas, the plus 2% reported comp for February would have been a plus 7%. The reported flat international comp would have actually been a plus 12%. And there's a little benefit in there from the switch in the Lunar New Year, I believe, that impacted a couple of the Asia countries for us. As such that total company comps, the reported plus 1% for the month would have been a plus 8%, excluding gas, deflation and FX.\r\nIn terms of new openings. After opening 9 new locations in Q1, including 1 relo, we opened no new locations in Q2. All told, that puts our fiscal 2015 openings through the second quarter still at 8 net new locations. And we now operate 670 -- 671 locations around the world.\r\nBetween now and the end of fiscal 2015, we expect to open an additional 20 new locations. Just a couple in Q3, which will end in early to mid-May, and then 18 planned for Q4. Of these 20 additional openings before our August 30 fiscal year-end, 10 are in the U.S., and 10 will be international. So we'll most likely end the fiscal year with 691 total locations.\r\nNow a few of those near the end -- very end of the fiscal year could slip into Q1 of '16. So my guess is that, that additional 20 may be 17, 18, who knows?\r\nAlso this morning, I'll review with you our e-commerce activities; our membership trends and renewal rates; a little more discussion on margins and SG&A in the quarter; our recent $5 a share special cash dividend and the related $1 billion debt offering; and our recent announcement related to the planned changes for our U.S. co-branded credit card offering.\r\nFor our second quarter results. Sales for the quarter -- for the 12 weeks ended February 15 were $26.87 billion, up 4% from last year's $25.76 billion. On a reported comp basis, as I mentioned, Q2 comps were up 2%, but up 8% excluding gas and FX.\r\nNow for the quarter, that reported plus 2% was a combination of an average transaction decrease of a little over minus 3%. But again, taking gas out of that number, then the average transaction increase would have been plus -- taking gas and FX out of that number, the average normalized transaction increase would have been a little over 2% to the positive, and average frequency increase of a little over 5.5%. So year-to-date, shopping frequency is up a little over 5%.\r\nIn terms of sales comparisons by geographic region. For the quarter, in terms of geography, Midwest, Southeast and Northeast regions were the strongest. Internationally, in local currencies, Japan was the weakest, still due -- impacted by cannibalization of 2 units we opened in the last 12 months on a base of -- a total base of only 20 over there; and with Taiwan, Korea and Mexico being strongest in local currency comps.\r\nIn terms of merchandise categories for the quarter. For the second quarter, within food and sundries, overall in the mid-single digits. Candy, meat, deli, beer and wine were the relative standouts.\r\nWithin hardlines, overall in the low-single digits. Departments that were the strongest were tires and electronics. Consumer electronics was up in the mid-single digits.\r\nWithin mid-single digit softlines comps, domestics and apparel were standouts.\r\nAnd in fresh foods, where comps were in the high singles, meat showed the best results, although impacted by inflation there.\r\nFor February, traffic was up again 5%, while average transaction on a reported basis was down 3.5%. But again, getting really impacted by FX and even weaker gas year-over-year.\r\nGas prices during the month -- 4-week month of February year-over-year, the average price of gasoline is almost down by 3.5 -- 31.5%.\r\nIn terms of geography. Midwest, Southeast and Bay Area regions were the strongest during February. And internationally, in local currencies, Taiwan and Korea were the strongest. As I previously -- a I mentioned previously, the shift in the Lunar New Year holiday from January to February negatively impact January comps and positively impact February comps for the company probably about 50 basis points each way.\r\nFrom a merchandising categories -- merchandise category standpoint, x FX, food and sundries overall for the month was in the mid-single-digit range. Hardlines overall came in to the mid- to low-single digits, which was consistent with what electronics did during February. Softlines was up in the mid-single-digit range. And finally, fresh foods up nicely in the low-teens overall, with meat being the strongest. And again, as I mentioned, see quite a bit of inflation in that area.\r\nMoving on to the line items down the income statement. Membership fees were up 4 basis points and up 6% from $550 million a year ago in the quarter to $582 million or up $32 million. Take out FX, the up 6% in dollars would have been up 9%.\r\nIn terms of membership. We continue to enjoy strong renewal rates. Our U.S. and Canada renewal rates still is at 91%. I think just a shade under that. We're averaging up to 91%. And for the first time, our fully captured worldwide rate is rounding up to 88% instead of down to 87%.\r\nContinued increasing penetration of Executive member, of course, help us as well as those numbers tend to be the most loyal. New membership sign-ups in Q2 company-wide were up 9%.\r\nIn terms of members at Q2 end. In terms of Gold Star, we ended Q2 with 32.7 million members, up from 32.0 million, up about -- a little under 700,000 from the end of the first quarter 12 weeks earlier.\r\nPrimary Business inched up from 6.9 million to 7.0 million. Add-on remained at 3.5 million.\r\nSo total member households, 42.5 million at the end of Q1 and 43.2 million at the end of Q2. And representing total cardholders going from 77.5 million to 78.7 million over the 12-week fiscal quarter.\r\nAt Q2 end, on February 15, Paid Executive memberships were a shade over 15.4 million, which was an increase of 188,000 during the quarter or about 15,000 a week. And that's both new member sign-ups as well as conversions.\r\nThe Executive members, as I mentioned before, a little over 2/3 of our -- about 2/3 of our membership base -- a little over 2/3 of our membership base and just about 2/3 of our sales. I'm sorry, about 1/3 of our membership base and about 2/3 of our sales.\r\nIn terms of renewal rates. They continued strong. Again, from business renewal -- business member renewal rates at Q1 end was 94.5%. It tweaked up to 94.6% at the end of Q2. Gold Star was 89.8%, inched up to 89.9%. And total was -- remained at a 90.7%. And worldwide, the 87.3% went to an 87.9%.\r\nYou'll see a little bit bigger increase there because when you start at a lower base that tends to improve a little bit faster in those first few years.\r\nNow I'll comment on this past Monday's press release regarding Costco entering into long term co-brand credit card agreement with Citi and our acceptance and co-brand agreement with Visa.\r\nAs the press release stated, we've entered into a new co-branded credit card agreement with Citi and an acceptance and co-brand incentive agreement with Visa. These agreements are subject to the purchase from American Express of the existing co-brand credit card portfolio by Citi and would be implemented -- wouldn't be implemented until next April 1, 2016, at the end of our current co-brand arrangement.\r\nWhile there's not a lot of specifics I can give you at this point, I can tell you the following: once issued, the new co-brand Costco Visa credit card will be accepted throughout the United States and Puerto Rico; the new rewards-based card will be fees free -- fee free; the new card will, needless to say, provide generous rewards to Costco members utilizing the new card. And again, I can't tell you a lot of specifics about that, but we certainly look forward to telling you and our members more about it, but not -- but it probably is not going to be until several months down the road this calendar year\r\nThe new card, of course, will also serve as the members' Costco membership card. Again, there's not a lot of detail we can give you at this point. Needless to say, what we do is ultimately for the long-term benefit of our company and our members, in this case, the co-brand credit card holders as well.\r\nGoing down the gross margin line. Gross margin were up 54 basis points on a reported basis from 10.53% to 11.07%. As I always ask you to do, I'll ask you to jot down 4 columns and 6 line items. The columns, of course, will be Q1 '15, both reported and without gas deflation, and then the columns 3 and 4 would be Q2 '15 reported and without gas deflation.\r\nAnd going across those line items, the first one is core merchandise. And reported in Q1 was minus 6 basis points year-over-year; without gas deflation was minus 13. In Q2, reported was plus 10; without gas deflation was minus 20. Ancillary, plus 22 and plus 20 in Q1; and plus 46 and plus 49 (sic) [ 39 ] in Q2. 2% Reward, minus 1 and minus 1; and then minus 5 and minus 2. LIFO, plus 1 and plus 1; and then in Q2, plus 3 and plus 3. And then Other, plus 6 and plus 7 in Q1; and 0 and 0 in Q2. All told, in Q1 last -- Q1 '15 year-over-year to Q1 '14, we had a reported gross margin improvement of 22, which is the sum of those line items in column 1. On a gas-neutral basis, it was plus 14. Again, reported for this quarter was plus 54. And on a gas-neutral basis, excluding gas deflation, was a plus 20.\r\nNow as you can see, again, our overall gross margin was up by plus 54 and even at plus 20 without gas deflation. Again, a lot of this has to do with gas sales penetration, which were way up as well, even though with a lower price per gallon.\r\nOur core merchandise gross margin was up 10 basis points year-over-year. But again, excluding gas, you see in this chart, it was down 20. Again, this is a function of both increased sales penetration and strong gross margins with our gas business.\r\nIf you look at the core gross margins as a percent of the various departments of their own sales -- and then when I talk about core, I'm talking about food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, which account for about 80-plus percent of our total sales -- on their own sales, they were down year-over-year by 3 basis points in the second quarter, with food and sundries and hardlines being up year-over-year a little and softlines and fresh foods being down a little.\r\nFrankly, margins are fine. We're driving sales. And certainly, gas prices give us plenty of room to be -- to continue to be aggressive. Although with gas prices going up the other way right now, we're -- you don't expect to see those kind of outsized gas profits in the next quarter.\r\nAncillary and other business gross margin was up 46 on a reported basis, 39 without gas deflation. Again, our gas business accounted for nearly 2/3 of this Q2 year-over-year increase. But we also showed higher year-over-year margins in optical, hearing aids and pharmacy.\r\nThe impact of the increasing Executive membership was good. It hit margins by 5 basis points or 2 basis points without gas deflation. And again, that's, that 2% Reward feature. This just generally reflects continued increased sales penetration of the Executive members, which, again, as I mentioned, buy more and are more loyal and shop more frequently.\r\nLIFO in the second quarter. We recorded a $4 million credit pretax compared to a $5 million pretax charge last year, so about $0.01 a share -- $0.01 a share or 3-basis-points benefit year-over-year for $9 million to the gross margin.\r\nMoving on to SG&A. Our SG&A percentage Q2-over-Q2 was higher or worse by 11 basis points, coming in at 9.94% this year versus a 9.90% -- 9.83% last year. Again, we'll do the same 4 columns, reported and without gas impact Q1 '15, then columns 3 and 4, Q2 '15, both reported and without gas.\r\nFive line items, first one is core operations or just operations. Plus 8 basis points was reported in Q1. That mean -- plus here is a positive, meaning lower year-over-year, plus 15 without gas deflation; in Q2 was a plus 3 and a plus 29. Central, minus 1 and minus 1; and in Q2, minus 10 and minus 7, so higher year-over-year in that row. Stock compensation, minus 11 and minus 11; and then minus 4 and minus 3. There are no quarterly adjustments, so the last line item would be total. Again, we reported a minus -- a higher -- minus 4 -- year-over-year SG&A higher by 4 basis points in Q1, both on a reported -- on a reported basis plus 4 or lower by 4 basis points in Q1 without gas deflation. Again, in Q2, higher or minus 11 basis points and then better or lower by 19 basis points or a plus 19 basis points without gas deflation.\r\nNow a little editorial on SG&A here. Again, the operations component of SG&A was better by 3 in Q2 on a reported basis and better by 29 year-over-year, excluding gas deflation. Again, gasoline sales penetration and very low SG&A in the gas business certainly helps that number.\r\nWithin operations, excluding gas and other warehouse businesses, so taking all that out, payroll and benefits represented an improvement of 16 basis points of this 29-basis-point improvement. So again, strong sales overall certainly helped us improve payroll and benefits as well and get some leverage there.\r\nCentral expense was higher year-over-year by 10 or 7 without gas inflation (sic) [ deflation ]. As I mentioned earlier, increased IT spending for our modernization. This was a 7 basis points on a reported basis, 5 basis points without deflation and FX. And lastly, in both years, we had a few discrete items to the tune of about minus 5 basis points, but that is what it is.\r\nFinally, within SG&A, our stock compensation expense, as I mentioned, was higher or worse by 4 basis points on a reported basis, 3 without gas deflation.\r\nNext on the income statement line, preopening expense. $8 million last year and $9 million this year. Last year, we had 3 openings. This year, we had no openings, but we've got plenty of openings coming up. So you've got quite a bit of preopening expense really starting, and there's lots of other little things that go into that number. No real surprises.\r\nAll told, operating income for Q2 came in at 877 -- $877 million, 21% higher year-over-year or higher by $153 million compared to last year's $724 million in the quarter.\r\nBelow the operating income line. Reported interest expense was essentially the same year-over-year, coming in at $26 million last year and $27 million this year.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, interest income and other was lower by $10 million, coming in last year in the quarter of $30 million to the positive; this year, only $20 million to the positive. Actual interest income for the quarter was higher by $3 million. The other swing was a minus $13 million. And again, most of that relates to year-over-year swings in various FX things. In this case, I think the biggest piece was the revaluation settlement of dollar payables -- U.S. dollar payables, primarily in our Mexico operations. I think that was a small positive last quarter.\r\nOverall, pretax income was higher by 20% or up $142 million from $728 million last year in the quarter to $870 million this year.\r\nIn terms of income taxes. Our company tax rate this quarter came in at a -- needless to say, on a reported basis, at a very low 30.2% versus 35.0% last year. Again, the income tax line benefited primarily from a $57 million tax benefit in connection with the special cash dividend.\r\nDividends paid on Costco shares held by our employees in our 401(k) plan, which total about 29 million shares, are deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. And we recognized a onetime income tax benefit of approximately $57 million related to that. As I mentioned, there was an offset to that benefit of about $14 million after-tax charge to the income tax line related to an ongoing income tax matter.\r\nExcluding 2 -- these 2 items, our Q2 tax rate this year was actually up -- would have been up 0.1% to 35.1%, just slightly higher compared to last year's 35.0% on a normal basis.\r\nOverall, reported net income was $463 million last year compared to a reported $598 million in net income this year. Again, this year's net income on a reported basis was up 28%, 29%. Taking out those 2 tax items, up about 19%.\r\nFor a quick rundown of other topics. The balance sheet is included in the morning's press release, a couple of balance sheet information items. Depreciation and amortization for Q2 totaled $260 million in the quarter and $514 million year-to-date.\r\nAccounts payable ratio, accounts payable as a percent of inventories, on a reported basis has shown improvement year-over-year from a 93% to a 97%. There's a lot of construction payables in that. It showed a comparable improvement from an 83%, if you just do merchandise -- accounts payable as a percent of merchandise inventories -- merchandise accounts payable as a percent of merchandise inventories, 83% last year up to 87% this year in the quarter.\r\nAverage inventory per warehouse was darn near flat, coming in at $12.8 million this year on average per warehouse, up about $20,000 compared to a year ago. So pretty much flat. x FX, year-over-year inventory was -- levels were up -- would have been up about $350,000 or about 2.7% of sales on, again, an 8% sales increase. So I think good control of our inventories. And inventory is in good shape. Our mid-year fiscals came in just fine because of the inventories.\r\nI'll respond at this point to questions received in the past few months about the work slowdowns. As you know, in the West Coast ports, there's -- 1.5 weeks ago, I guess, there was a new agreement. So things are getting back to order, although the view is it will take 4 to 8 weeks, if not a little longer, to get through the back up there. We, like, I'm sure, every other employer of containers are trying to identify which ones have priority where we can. And really, pretty much the impact of that's over.\r\nWhen we talk to our head -- our heads of merchandising in the different areas, their view is, in Q2, we might -- probably got hit by $100 million, $200 million. Nothing to really speak of in terms of sales. And it's probably a little worse for some others out there.\r\nIn terms of CapEx. In Q1, we spent $555 million on CapEx. In Q2, we spent $619 million. So quarter-to-date, just under $1.2 billion. For the year, we still expect to be somewhere in the $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion range, which is up from $2.0 billion last year.\r\nIn terms of Costco Online. We continue to operate it in the 4 countries: U.S., Canada, U.K. and Mexico. We're also doing things, not really online, but through Alibaba Tmall in Asia. But in terms of the 4 countries online, there's costco.com. Sales and profits, needless to say, were up during the quarter. Sales were up 23% in the quarter. Comp sales in the U.S. were similarly up right around 23%. Foreign sales in the other 3 countries were up, on a local currency basis, 20-and-more percent as well. But again, with the currencies being down, there's some impact there. But overall, continued good results and sales strengthen on our dot-com efforts.\r\nIn terms of expansion. As I mentioned, we plan in Q3 to open 3 units, including 1 relocation, so net of 2; and have current plans for 19, which includes 1 relo, so net of 18 new in Q4.\r\nAssuming we opened those, we'd be at 28 net new units for the year or about 4.5% square footage growth. And by country, assuming we get to 28, it would be 17 in the U.S., so a little under 2/3 there; 1 in Canada; 1 in the U.K.; 5 in Asia; 1 in Korea; 1 in Taiwan; and 3 in Japan; as well as 1 in Australia; and 3 new in Mexico. As of Q2 end, total square footage stood at 96.4 million square feet.\r\nIn terms of stock buybacks. In Q1, as you know, we started the process, have bought a little bit. We bought $18 million worth or 139,000 shares at an average price of $120 -- a little over $126 a share. In Q2, we expended $92 million to buy 642,000 shares at an average price of $143.21. Now a bunch of that was done before the dividend date, the $5 ex-dividend date.\r\nIn terms of dividends. Our quarter -- our current quarterly dividend stands at $0.355 a share or $1.42 per share annualized. That represents a total cost to the company of about $630 million.\r\nThis regular dividend, of course, was in addition to the $5 per share dividend, which amounted to $2.2 billion that we paid out last -- on February 27. And in fact, both dividends were paid to shareholders on February 27.\r\nAs I mentioned, we also completed a 1 -- to pay in part for the $2.2 billion special dividend, we did a $1 billion debt offering a few weeks back. That $500 million of 5-year fixed and $500 million of 7-year fixed at attractive market rates.\r\nLastly, just a couple of other items of note. The March comp sales reporting period for this year will include 34 selling days versus -- which is 1 day less than the 35 days last year, reflecting the calendar shift of the Easter holiday.\r\nAnd in addition, beginning next month, we'll report -- we'll start reporting comp sales 1 day earlier than we have historically done. So March comp sales will be announced on Wednesday, April 8, after the market close, around 6 p.m. Pacific time and 9 p.m. Eastern time. Hopefully, that will help our East Coast friends.\r\nAnd similarly, our Q3 scheduled earnings release date will be Wednesday, May 27, for the 12-week third quarter ending May 10. Again, the release will occur at 6 p.m. Pacific time, 9 p.m. Eastern time that Wednesday, with the earnings conference call still occurring the following morning.\r\nBefore I turn the call back to Brandy for Q&A, hopefully, I've helped everyone understanding some of the factors impacting the number. Overall, I think, we had -- and certainly, the outsized gas profits helped, but there are lots of other little things that went the other way. So overall, still we felt pretty good a quarter and certainly strong sales, membership renewal rates and the like.\r\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Brandy for any Q&A. Thank you.",
      "transcript_text3": "I guess my first question is, when you look at your gas business today, clearly, it's a bucket for you guys to pull from to invest back in pricing for you guys to kind of be like Costco, if you will. Is there a way to quantify that this quarter? I mean, clearly, the core margins within the 80% of the business being down 3 basis points, was there some impact from you guys being more aggressive on price? Or if you can maybe just speak there thematically.\n\n---\n\nI think, qualitatively, it allowed us to be a little more aggressive. We just didn't say, \"Hey, take this extra money and put it at all there.\" We didn't. We certainly benefited from it in the quarter. And again, it's not like we looked at it as, that will be an offset to FX, as an example, because we know that FX has still got -- even if FX rates continue to stay where they are right now and don't get any relatively weaker, it's still on a relative basis in Q3 and 4 are going to be relatively weaker. So we recognize that Q3 and 4 will be a little more challenged in that regard. But certainly, could margins have been up a few instead of down a few? Probably, but who knows?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Fair enough. And then when you look to March of next year and the change in tenders, it's my understanding there's roughly 750 million U.S. Visa cardholders today, and there's roughly 50 million Amex holders today in the U.S. How big an opportunity this could be for you guys to expand your membership base when you move into next year?\n\n---\n\nWell, look, we'll see. I mean, there's a lot of unknowns. The first order of business is for Citi to work with American Express and figure out the account portfolio. A lot hinges on that. We expect that to happen, but there's no guarantees. And there'll be -- and again, there's a lot I'd like to tell you. There's a lot we'll figure out now. We know the bucket of dollars, if you will, in our mind, of what we can use to drive usage of that kind of card, recognizing there'll be some cannibalization. Somebody that has a Visa Mileage card in their wallet that may want to use that instead. Just like there's cannibalization now. There's people that use a non-cobranded Amex card. Similar, there'll be other places where there's outside spend increase because your neighborhood dry cleaner, one card is accepted and another card is not. So there's lots -- I think there's lots of opportunities, and we have to get there first. And first order of business is the transition itself. And we'll -- there'll be a lot more to say once we get there.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just last question on e-commerce, up 23% in the quarter. Can you just remind us the number of SKUs online today relative to a year ago and where you think that can go? How much is crossing through your depots versus not? And then just margins on e-commerce relative to the clubs.\n\n---\n\nIt's probably approaching 8,000 regular SKUs. I'm excluding from that that we have a lot of tire SKUs based on all the sizes. We've got a lot of office product SKUs through a third party. But the core SKUs on our side is 8,000, probably 1,500-plus more than a year ago. And I'm guessing there, but that's probably a good number. And that we're -- those increases are -- a lot are sundries items, some apparel items, things like that, trying to get you to come back on a more frequent basis. And smaller ticket items, a lot of the items we've added are items like I've mentioned versus $300 to $2,000 televisions and furniture sets.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Any color on profitability?\n\n---\n\nExcuse me?\n\n---\n\nJust those margins in the e-commerce business.\n\n---\n\nMargins overall are probably a shade lower -- are a shade a lower. SG&A is a lot lower. So profitability-wise, e-commerce is a very profitable operation relative to the company as a whole.\n\n---\n\nSo Rich, a two-part question to get at kind of the same thing. You've got some very busy clubs, and you keep increasing traffic mid-single digit every year. Do you guys spend a lot of time looking at kind of quality of experience in the club and maybe different parts of the club, right, like fresh? And with that in mind, is there an opportunity to open more clubs in the U.S. than you might have thought before, maybe cannibalize yourselves, gain share, improve the experience if some of them are too crowded. Have you guys done much work on that?\n\n---\n\nWell, yes, in a lot of different ways, but not in terms of, let's sit down and do that today at one time. I mean, first of all, quality of the experience, as you, I think, know -- I'm sure you know, our operators and our merchants are in the warehouses a lot. Craig and a random set of merchandising and operating executives just spent 2 days schlumping around part of the country visiting warehouses, both us and competition and other things, and looking at new sites. So I think, certainly, the number of responses that we get every day, the types of throughput per hour at the front-end register, all those things go into that. And I got to tell you, when a member writes a little complaint, doesn't have to be nasty, just a complaint, it gets heard. And recognizing we have -- we're always going to have some challenges. So we're constantly looking for that experience. We're constantly looking for that -- to get you out of there faster and to make it a better experience. I've got to tell you, we still get probably more positives than negatives in terms of e-mails that are sent in to senior management about positive experiences with -- a member with a particular employee who -- that helped in the warehouse or somebody who went above and beyond. So we have no illusion that we'll do everything right, but we're pretty steadfast of looking at all those things. In terms of willing to open more units, absolutely. I mean, if you would ask me 5 years ago when we were opening about 20 units a year, and probably -- I don't have the numbers in front of me, but probably it was 70-30 U.S. And you said, \"Richard, 5 years hence, where are you going to be?\" And I'd say, well, we're going to be about 30. And we actually got there, pretty close. And if it's 70-30 U.S. back then, it's probably 50-50 heading to 30-70 over the next 5 years. And here we are, almost 60-40, still in the U.S. I think that's a reflection that we're finding probably more opportunities than we thought possible. Some of it's what you mentioned, opening up in busy -- that quality of experience, the units that are 250 and 300 and even a few that are 300-plus, trying to get those in. We're trying to balance that because cannibalization does cause a little heartburn for a year. But a lot of it also is in, I think, surprising how many units we can put in some of the newer markets. And that newer is a relative term. Newer markets over the last -- in markets that we've been in for the last 5 or 10 years. And so I think it's a combination of all that. Again, last year, I think of that 20 -- in fact, I have it here, hold on. Of the -- here it is. Of the 20 -- in fiscal '13 -- sorry, last year, of the 29 net openings we had, I think 16 were in the U.S. And this year, of the 28 -- or 16 or 17 are in the U.S., so a little over half. And this year, it's -- what did I say? 17 out of 28, so almost 2/3. And so I think you'll -- probably, 5 years from now, as we go from, let's say, 30 to 35, probably still half are in the U.S., and we're finding more opportunities.\n\n---\n\nDo you think you can get to 1,000 there ultimately? Or you maybe have not gone out that far?\n\n---\n\nWell, we haven't gone out that far off yet. Yes, if you mean -- if you added 30 -- even 30 a year for 10 years, you're in a sense there. So yes, I think so. That's certainly not out of the realm.\n\n---\n\nAll right. And then secondly, what's the thought -- at least, it seems like anecdotally, maybe in certain items or categories, there may be a Kirkland introduced, maybe the brand or a brand is no longer carried. I don't think there's a conscious effort to -- although the quality and value of Kirkland certainly outstrips a lot of the brands, a conscious effort to get more Kirkland items in the store more space to them. Is there a conscious effort? Or that's just kind of it happens? You put it in, it's where the demand is and so maybe it squeezes out some brands along the way.\n\n---\n\nWell, I think, there's an ongoing conscious effort to -- there are people that are in charge of coming up with new Kirkland stuff in each merchandise category. And their job is to try to find new things, just like any buyer's job is to find good, exciting branded items. And ultimately, an item -- it is our cousin. It has Kirkland name on it, but it has to live and die like any other item. I think if we've added 30 or 40 items in the past 12 or 18 months, I bet you we've subtracted 20 or 30 that ultimately didn't work out. Then we bring back some a few years later that worked better. I remember years ago, we had an organic peanut butter Kirkland Signature that didn't set the world on fire. I think we're now testing it again, and it's a pretty good item. But we'll see how long pretty good means. So yes, we're -- it has to -- we recognize the strength of our concept is both KS and brand. And I don't think we -- if you said, \"Richard, you're at -- in the mid-20s now in terms of KS, do you ever see it going to 50?\" That's a stretch. I mean, even our own numbers internally when we say, \"How can we get it from 25 to 30?\" There's no formal game plan how many years is that going to take. It's what items work. And certainly, there's not a lot of low-hanging fruit. There's lots of $20 million and $30 million and $50 million items over time, not a lot of $300 million and $400 million items like paper goods or water and things like that or K-cups. And last comment before getting to the next question out there. In terms of cannibalization, even if that's ramped up a little bit, I was just looking over the last few years, if you go back to fiscal '13, what we call cannibalization, that's just not just here. That's opening 3 units in Japan, and that affects 3 or 5 other Japanese units. Total cannibalization in fiscal '13 was 65 basis points and '14 58 basis points. And for the first half of this year, it looks like it's about something in the low 40s. So it's going to fluctuate between 35 and 75, depending on what we do and where we do it. But my guess is something in the 40 to 50 range is kind of -- we're not going to be able to move that number overall a lot, okay? Next question?\n\n---\n\nIt's Dan Binder. My question -- my first question is related to the gas business. Can you just give us an update on where the comp gallons were in the quarter, where gas is as a percentage of the total sales? And then you mentioned that the gas margin would start to be a little bit less favorable given where price is, what prices are doing. Can you help us just understand kind of what the excess margin may have been to EPS this quarter?\n\n---\n\nYes, look, it was -- just on that line item, it was 2/3 of the margin improvement of all ancillary businesses. It could be 200-plus basis points of extra margin. I mean, our margins in gas on a daily basis over the years could be anywhere from a 0 to 5 or 6. And it's all over the board. Might even be a little higher sometimes. But it really ranges. And frankly, when it's a little higher, we're saving the customer more money. In terms of gallonage comps, I remember, for a couple of years, when the U.S. overall, not Costco, but all U.S. vehicle gallonage consumption was in the low-single digits and maybe when the bad economy hit, it went to the low negative single digits. And we went from -- we remained at 4, 5, 6, 7. Right now, we're in the mid-teens. So we're getting a lot of people coming in to Costco to buy gas. And that certainly drives them into the warehouse as well.\n\n---\n\nThen on the IT spend, you mentioned that -- I think you said it was $0.02 this quarter. As you look at Q3 and 4, what do you expect that impact to look like?\n\n---\n\nIt's hard to guess completely. I know we've had a couple of -- some of the original modules. And modules makes it sound like it's a small number. These are big numbers. But yes, you have projects that are $50 million, $60 million projects that the day they're put into service, they then, over the next, in our case, 55 [ph] 4-week periods, over the next 5 years, generally, you take a little under $1 million a month hit. And so some of those are starting to hit. So my guess is, it will -- is it that much? Is a little enough? It's hard to say. But still over a several-year period, incrementally recognizing your denominator, sales, keep getting bigger, too. But even with that bigger sales, we had indicated something in the low to mid-teens of basis points. I can be off by a couple of basis points, but it ain't cheap.\n\n---\n\nAnd then my last question was related to organics. Can you just give us an update on how many SKUs are in the club in at this point? What the mix is of sales and how that performed in the quarter, kind of what you're thinking about that business going forward?\n\n---\n\nYes. It's still a small percentage of Costco. It's a rising -- but it's a fast-growing area as it is with a lot of other retailers as well. You're going to see more and more of it. A part of that's availability. We could sell -- we and everybody else could sell a lot more if there was more out there. I think we're doing a pretty good job of lining up our sourcing. And I think I mentioned last quarter that for all of '14, organic was like approaching $3 billion, which was more than twice what it was 2 years earlier, 1.5 years earlier. It's growing fast. I don't know if it's 50% a year, but it's certainly growing at a high -- at a mid -- a low mid or mid-double-digit number. And it's great for us because we show even a better value on that stuff than some of the things that it replaces. When we can do organic ground beef, where everybody football's regular ground beef, and everybody makes a lower-than-average margin, this is the item that everybody tries to make more on. And so we can make a little more, not a lot more, and show a greater value to our member. So it'll keep growing. Sorry, I can't be more specific.\n\n---\n\nIt's Mark Becks on for Chris. Just a follow-up on a couple of Chuck's questions, actually. So it doesn't look like you're getting into too much specifics about the change in that credit card, AMX, et cetera. Just curious, what has been the response that you've seen from our friends up north? I know that sort of changed over in January. Maybe what the reception has been there?\n\n---\n\nWell, it's been good so far. I mean, we're getting a lot of people to switch, recognizing it's people's membership card as well. And if anything, our view of the U.S. should be -- I guess, I can't get into a lot of it right now. We wouldn't have done this if I thought there was a lot of risk associated with it. We think it's a big positive over a long period of time, but recognizing big positives to us means giving most of it back to the customer, in this case, most of it back to the co-branded user of a credit card. And that's going to happen. We're really not going to be able to tell you a lot about it for a number of months.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I guess I'll switch back to the gas prices then. Historically, the adage has been you guys benefit when prices go up. But it looks like, just based on gallonage and then mileage driven, which has only been up a couple of percent, that you guys are actually capturing a lot more share now than in sort of history period. Would you -- Is that something you would agree with?\n\n---\n\nYes. No, there's 2 prices to that, just so everybody understands. When prices go up, we make less and save the customer. We still save them but save them less. When prices go down, we save them more, and we make more. Certainly, prices going down, we save the customer more, and that's positive. And we make a little more -- or a lot more, right, of -- that's changed in the last few weeks. But we made a lot more in the last few quarters. If you go -- the other thing -- the thing, I think, you're talking about is when -- it was in the press every day. As prices went from $3 to $4 to $4-plus dollars a gallon, it was on the news every night in every city. That helped us, I think. The offset to that would be as prices are less important, how can that help you? I don't know, other than it is. And it is a lot because our gallon's just quite a bit up.\n\n---\n\nDid you say what the volume and gallonage was? I think it was, call it up, 11% last quarter.\n\n---\n\nIt was in the mid-teens, I think, we mentioned.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Yes. So pretty big acceleration there. And then just finally on geography...\n\n---\n\nYes, by the way, just getting back to that comment. I think you people ask us why? I think it's because we do a good job of being the most competitive price. There's that third-party, it's gasbody.com, that 40-whatever million people input their price to what they bought gas for, for 2 years in a row since they started announcing best overall low price out there by $0.14 Or $0.16 a gallon across the country. Now you're going to -- that's not every station, every day, everywhere. But on average, with all those data points, we're in. I think that kind of publicity helps us as well.\n\n---\n\nNow, that makes perfect sense. And then just the last question on sort of geographical differences. It looks like you caught out the Midwest, then the South area as the strongest. Obviously, a lot of moving pieces there with the Chinese New Year that helped. But then the port shutdowns, which, on our math, comes out to 60 basis points roughly. Maybe just sort of what you're seeing. Elaborate a little bit geography, and then maybe the Northeast. I know we've seen some pretty severe weather here as of late.\n\n---\n\nWell, look, I think you summed up what we summed up on the port strike and the Lunar New Year switch. Yes, I think the big deal is that weather has played a role, although we -- it did last year as well. But if I look at New York -- the Northeast as an example, the 4 weeks that comprised February, the first 2 weeks were mid-positive single, and the last 2 weeks were mid-negative single-digit. That's a huge swing. But other areas did just fine. The Texas region got hammered last week with weather, but overall, we're -- it's -- we've done okay.\n\n---\n\nA couple of quick ones. On the credit card, I know you're not going to share a lot of details. Is there -- besides, probably, some savings just from some lower interchange fees or credit card fees, is there any elevators such that if there's certain volumes met, you could see benefits -- further benefits down the road? Or is this the lower fees, you'll see a benefit upfront? And then from there, just how much business you do?\n\n---\n\nAs you are asking, I'm looking at my wall behind me, and there's a handwritten note from many years ago when our Securities Counsel was sitting here. He quickly -- if somebody's asking a question, he wrote, \"We have no comment beyond the release.\" The reality is, there's lots of buttons that you push on these agreements. There's all aspects of it. At the end of the day, whatever our current arrangement -- as we look at it, whatever our current arrangement is with our current provider, both what we pay, what we receive to offset some of that, what our member using that co-brand cardholder is rewarded, we start with a premise of how much is that to start with? What do we think we can go to? At the end of the day, we can -- whatever that bucket of money is, it can go towards lowering merchant fees, raising rewards or using some other place in our company. We'll figure it out. There's -- we think that's an exciting bucket, and we'll do a lot with it. But just like I've told people in the past, if we can save $1 on buying a product better, whether it's detergent or coffee or anything or due to packaging or raw materials cost or energy costs, we're going to give $0.80, $0.90 back to the customer. And rest assured, there'll be -- whatever benefit x is, a little bit of it will accrue to our P&L and a lot of it will accrue to the member in some way, shape or form. But none of that -- we can't really tell you until next year.\n\n---\n\nThat's fine. That makes sense. On membership, I know you don't say a lot international versus U.S. But can you just speak directionally to whatever growth rate you're seeing in membership, whatever trend line has been occurring? How is that? Has it changed much? Is it the same in the U.S. versus international?\n\n---\n\nIt's higher international because we're newer. Needless to say -- and I think I've shared in the past. I mean, if you take the total number of members divided by our total number of warehouses, you've got roughly 59,000, 60,000 member households per warehouse. In Japan, you've got a number that has -- is a 3-digit number. It's 100 -- in the low 100s. You also have a higher -- a lower renewal rate in those first few years. So it tends to balance out over time, but we operate overall in other countries on a membership fee as a higher percentage of sales, particularly in Asia.\n\n---\n\nBut whatever prevailing growth rate there has been in membership in the U.S. up until second quarter or up until the first meeting, has that run rate stayed the same in the U.S.?\n\n---\n\nYes, again, a lot of it is dictated by new openings. And again, it's going to be dictated more by -- when I said new member sign-ups in the quarter were up 9%, there've been times when it's been almost flat. But part of that -- or down a little bit because a year earlier in that quarter, you opened 3 units in Asia, where you might have -- and again, I talked about an average of roughly 60,000 member households per location. We've had locations that will have new member sign-ups as of opening day. And that as of opening day means during the 8 or 10 or 12 weeks prior to opening when the parking lot is kind of set, and we have the flags and the tabling activities out front side. You could have anywhere from 25,000 to 40,000 members signed up. Now 40% of market renewal a year later, but in terms of new members coming in and buying a membership, and that really distorts that number. So I don't know how much meaning -- that plus 9 is a function of that as well, but we always point that out.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just very quickly, can you just remind us on the e-commerce business. Is there other member-only items or meaning -- or is there items someone can just -- that's not a member can come on the website and purchase as well?\n\n---\n\nIt is crazy world. There are some items that we have online where we have agreed not to show the price unless you're a member.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Not to show the price. But the only person who's buying on your website is a member?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to just touch on membership as well, certainly with consistent and strong traffic. And you certainly are saving people money at the palm. How are you thinking about the value proposition of your membership currently in the U.S. and international? What may be the timeline in terms of you kind of reassessing what you think the value of the membership should be?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think, at a roundabout what you're asking about when do we see this, I think, there is a possibility of a fee change. Historically, that, really, we think about last. We drive prices and value every day in everything we do. And I mean it. If you go to our budget meetings every 4 weeks, and you've got a 1.5 days, and 1/2 of that time or 1/3 of that time is merchants. And we're figuring out how to improve the value and lower the price and raise the quality. And historically, using U.S. and Canada as 80% of our business, first of all, and probably 80-ish -- a little different than that number, but pretty close in terms of percent of members, you have a -- we've done a fee increase about every 5 or 6 years. The last one we did was in very late '11, very early '12. So during the -- most of the calendar year of '12, those renewers, for the first time in 5 or 6 years, saw a fee increase from 50 to 55 and from 100 to 110 on the executive in the U.S. and Canada. If history repeats itself, 5 to 6 years from January of '12 would be January of '17 into January of '18. So that, again, based on history, doesn't mean we're going to do or not going to do it. We've chosen generally to hold membership fees at whatever their prices are, mostly other countries, in part, because it's so darn strong to start with, and why not continue to drive the business? And so, again, I think, it's generally the last thing we look at, but something we've looked at regularly over 30 years. And I'm sure we'll look at it again when the time is right.\n\n---\n\nSounds good. And then just circling back to gas profitability. I know you've addressed this a few times on the call, but given the spread between the street's forecast and the actual for 2Q, I just wanted to touch back on your comments around the third quarter. You mentioned that gas prices have started to trickle back up. But frankly, can you help us just kind of think about our expectations for the back half of the year? Should it be closer to a more normalized cadence around gasoline profitability? Or do you continue to see a little bit of tailwind given the favorable mix?\n\n---\n\nWell, if you look at history, when we -- each quarter for the last several years, we'll share with people that gas helped us a little, hurt us a little, helped us a lot, hurt us a lot, it's all -- it's virtually all -- it's pretty much in proportion with the trend of gas prices per gallon. And so, as you know, the constant drive-down has stopped, and it should've been up a little bit. So a lot of that party is now behind us for right now. And -- but I can't really tell you what it's going to be other than, historically, that's what it's been.\n\n---\n\nIt's Matt Fassler. First question relates to the special dividend. I guess, this is our first conference call since you announced the last one. With prior special dividend, it was around the time of tax policy change, and many companies pursued that tack. As you take a bigger picture look now at capital allocation, understanding that you did accelerate the stock buyback a bit, how are you thinking about special dividends, perhaps, as a recurring element of capital allocation? And any other light you want to share on your decision to issue that one last week?\n\n---\n\nWell, I mean, we now have 2 data points instead of 1. We did it. And you're right, the motivation or one of the motivations for doing it when we did it was reading about in the Wall Street Journal every day and just before people expected a dividend tax rate to go up dramatically. So it made sense to be not only shareholder-friendly but shareholder-friendly in a way that might help people as well if tax rates were going to change and be proactive about that. I think we appreciate the fact that it was perceived as being shareholder-friendly. As you might expect, both management and the Board wanted to continue to do things in that regard. And it's not like we sat down and did this giant study exactly when, how much and what should we do. I think we liked it the first time, and it seems like our shareholders liked it the second time. I'm not trying to be cute or coy about it. They're a little independent of each other. I think when we did the first one, which was a little over $3 billion worth, it was quite sizable. It was a time when, I guess, in retrospect, we could've bought some more stock back. It would've been a smart thing to do given where it's at now. But we wanted -- we tend to do both. And we tend to look all things, first and foremost, CapEx, how can we ramp up CapEx, and we've done that. Second would be our regular dividend, what are we going to do with that every year? Again, there's no guarantees. But in each of the last spring periods over the last 9 years, I think we've raised it, on average, around 13.5%. We looked -- as you know, from your models and our models, we are generating more cash than we can use in CapEx. And so we'll continue to look at ways to be shareholder-friendly. And -- but there's no reason to think it will be 2 years, hence, we'll do another one. But as always, we think we will. We'll see.\n\n---\n\nIt's interesting. Even though you're running with several billion dollars of cash on the balance sheet, you have come to the debt markets, which, I understand, is opportunistic. Should we think about the cash balance that you have today as something that you feel you need to be comfortable with? Or is that a number that you can whittle down over time?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think it's a number we could whittle down. Mind you, I'm looking at quarter end. This number might be a shade different than the balance sheet number, but I think we had cash and short-term investments of -- it was in the press release number there. Hold on a second. Actually, we had cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter of $7.4 billion roughly and add a number that wasn't completely consolidated like $7.2 billion. But if you look at that roughly $7.4 billion number, about $2.5 billion is real cash in the U.S. Another $2.5 billion, $3 billion is real cash outside the U.S. where we're spending it, frankly. In addition, we announced last year that we brought back some of the cash in Canada. So I think we can whittle the number down, but it's -- I guess some of it's cash equivalents. If you think about -- from the time banks closed on Friday night to the time they open on Monday morning, all those debit and credit receivables, which could be upwards of $1 billion, $1.5 billion -- $1 billion-plus, that is a cash equivalent, but it's not cash.\n\n---\n\nGot it. That's very helpful. And then just a very quick follow-up. We're seeing the LIFO metric creep up. I know it's only a couple of basis points, but it's a nice change from a year ago when, I guess, you peaked at around an 8 basis point hit. Could you just talk about what the moving pieces are in driving that? I know you feel like you're fully marked at the end of any given quarter, but if you had to place bets, which direction that would go for the rest of the year? It'd be very helpful.\n\n---\n\nI don't know. Gas has come up a little bit, although it's still below where it was at the beginning of the year. So that's still probably -- as of today, it's LIFO-creditable. I don't think it's going to be a big, giant number either way, but it's a little bit of a crapshoot at this point. Yes, by the way, Matt, a part of it is some proteins are inflationary right now for not all reasons related. And then some other things, we're just starting to see the beginnings of some deflationary pressure on items manufactured with oil, plastic bags and the like. So some of that is starting to finally flow through. So there'll be some things that are inflationary and some that are deflationary.\n\n---\n\nI'm not sure if it's too early to ask this, but just curious about the members that you brought in via the LivingSocial promotion several months ago. Just curious if you're tracking them following -- are they following that typical spending pattern of a new member in terms of spending and frequency?\n\n---\n\nI'm going to punt because I don't know the answer to that. But if you hold that question for next quarter, I promise we'll have some numbers. I know that we are tracking it, and I just don't have the detail on it. I know that, on average, they are a little younger. I don't know spend habits.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Then just another one. You mentioned the Bay Area as, I think, a strong region either in the quarter or for the month. Just -- I know that's an area where you have more robust offering in organics. Just curious if that's part of it. And maybe are -- how plans are to kind of bring that more robust organic offering to some more clubs in the rest of the country?\n\n---\n\nWell, that's probably a little piece of it. I think weather, overall, has helped. The West Coast, as bad as it's been in Texas and the Midwest and the East Coast, it's been offsettingly good over on our side of the country. And I'm sure that's helped some. Clearly, I think, some of the merchandising efforts we've done on organics has helped. Part of that, we are doing it more in other parts of the country. Part of it is supply issues, and it will still take time for that to grow.\n\n---\n\nLet me go back to e-Commerce and then the ancillary services x gas. And just explore -- I know, I think, you said that the margins are great. Did you give us a number on how big e-Commerce is?\n\n---\n\nNo. It's -- you mean total size of e-Commerce?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nIt's about 3% of our total.\n\n---\n\n3% of your total sales?\n\n---\n\nOn an annualized basis, I think last year, it was 2.9-something.\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n$3 billion and growing at 20%.\n\n---\n\n$3 billion and going 20%, 25%. And then from a gross margin perspective, I mean, how do we think about SG&A associated with that business? Is there much of it? I mean, is it like fractional? A couple of percent? I mean, how do we think of SG&A when you look at it. I know a lot of stuff just goes directly to the consumer. About 60% of it is the -- is there really a lot of SG&A associated?\n\n---\n\nNo, there's -- margins are a -- let me just look here. Margins are a shade lower, not a lot. And SG&A is a lot lower.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Okay. So -- and then from a philosophical -- everyone's always ragged on -- or not ragged on, that way. Everyone's always -- there are some people who have criticized Costco because they don't let enough flow through to shareholders. How do we think about that? I think the gross margins are -- what you're saying, a little bit lower. SG&A is a lot lower. So net-net, we got much better operating profit in the e-Commerce business. Is that okay with the company? Or is that something that you would try to make look like the rest of it -- rest of the business?\n\n---\n\nNo, look, I don't -- I mean, we're retailers. There's different parts of it. No, we're happy to make a little more there. We're still making -- first and foremost, are we as competitive as we can be relative to others? And we feel that we are very competitive. We're also recognizing that e-commerce is supported by the buying strength of the  warehouses. As we brought inline electronics and furniture and some of those bigger-ticket categories, that buying strength, how do you compensate -- how does e-Commerce, if you will, compensate for that? So it's all part of the same thing. The fact that its margins overall are a little lower than the warehouses, I think, is indicative -- is a function of that. And we'll continue to do that. We work on a strong profit than some of the other ancillary businesses, but they also have different either costs associated with it or purchasing powers. Pharmacies, of course, you've got pharmacists and pharmacy techs that make more than your average hourly employees. So you've got a higher cost structure there as well as all the regulatory and billing stuff going on in that business. So we work on a higher margin to offset some of that, but we also work on a profitability number that's good. So it's all part of the equation, if you will.\n\n---\n\nSure. Then just one last one. So I think you said you're up to 8,000 SKUs. One of the things we think benefits Costco hugely on the e-Commerce is that you're basically willing to use your people to do the shopping for me. In other words, like the fact that there isn't 2 million SKUs like there is on Wal-Mart site, I think, is a great attribute. So what's your thought about where the SKU count goes, kind of balancing Costco being a personal shopper versus wanting more, maybe more SKUs? Where do you think it goes?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think it probably goes up a little bit, but not a lot. The fact that it went from 4,000 to 8,000 or something in the last few years is a lot. But part of that was just trying to drive business -- adding some categories to get people -- for people to think of it as top-of-mind or near top-of-mind instead of not at all. If I had to think about a comment from a very loyal shareholder and somebody who loves Costco with 3 kids at home, 3 teenagers and said, \"Look, I love Costco. And I know when I go into a warehouse, I know I'm going to get the 10 items I planned to get in the food and sundries area and the other 10 that I didn't plan to get. But I know I'm going to come out with 20. I'm going to be sated. I know I'm going to have great food samples. I know we'll get 3 other things I'm not wearing and I had no plans to get them. And I'm excited about that, but I knew, going in, I was going to get 3 or 4 items that I didn't plan on getting. But when I go to -- gosh, I don't know why -- when do I go to costco.com?\" So part of our challenge in the west here on costco.com is not only driving sales of those bigger physical ticket -- bigger dollar ticket and physical ticket items that not everybody wants to shop home, like furniture and big-screen TVs and have a great price and a great, in many case, white glove service delivery. And we're driving that business. But also, how do we get you there more regularly? And whether it's K-cups and other items for your office or home or some apparel items, as you know, the 5.5 million KS sweatshirts that we sell every year, which is a great value. If you -- I always joked, if you're really tall with shorter arms, we cannot serve you because we don't sell all the sizes -- size and sleeve -- and color combinations.  Online, we do. So trying to get different reasons to get you onto the site more often is part of the equation here. And I think we're doing a pretty good job of doing that. But I don't see -- if you said, \"Richard, do you think you can get to 50,000 one day?\" Gosh, I don't see it in my near future.\n\n---\n\nI just had a bigger-picture question about holiday. Did you have -- would you prioritize any major learnings from holiday in terms of where you might look to do things differently next year? And then on the core merchandising margins number, what should we look at as helpful drivers for that positively going forward? Or what kind of run rate might we expect there?\n\n---\n\nWhat were you saying, what was the second part of that question?\n\n---\n\nThe core merchandise margins. What are some of the positive drivers we should look for in terms of optimism on the core merchandise margins? Whether it be inventory control? Or is the run rate at a slight negative, kind of realistic for us to model?\n\n---\n\nWell, needless to say, we don't provide -- on the latter part, we don't provide specific direction in that area. I remember, several years ago, when our margins were just down year-over-year every quarter for a couple of years, and every quarter we'd say, \"Margins are fine. We can tweak them a little bit if we want to and when we want to.\" I think that sentence -- that response is still there. I think we are -- we continue to get excited by strong sales and strong loyalty and strong conversion to executive member. And all those things will continue to take front seat to a little margin improvement. But if we want to get a little bit, we think we can while still being very competitive. In terms of what have we learned or not learned during the holiday, I think when we look back, I think we did a pretty good job of planning for the port slowdowns. And arguably, it's probably easier to do a better job when you're managing fewer items. And so while we got hurt by it a little bit, I think we probably mitigated that hurt. Beyond that, again, I think we are comfortable when raw materials prices and  bakery and food court and the like go up, that we're not going to change our prices. And if it hurts our margin a little bit, it hurts it. We can get it elsewhere. So I don't think there -- this was not -- given our strength, we didn't -- there weren't a lot of things necessarily learned as it relates to did sales soften and we drive more sales by more markdowns or something. I think we probably came out of this season pretty good and, if anything, we'll continue to be aggressive in terms of the types of products, the price points of products that -- our member wants great value or great items. And we'll continue to drive value the proposition in upscale items.\n\n---\n\nYes, that sounds encouraging. And inventories were nicely growing versus sales, like underpinning sales. Is that a trend we should also model going forward in terms of the spread being neutral?\n\n---\n\nProbably a little bit. Again, I wouldn't read too much into one quarter. For a number of years here, we've generally -- again, taking FX, gas out of it, which is the 4 walls of warehouse inventories on a non-FX-dilutive or increased basis. Generally speaking, we've had sales greater than inventory per warehouse increases. Sales were up 8 or 9. Inventories were up 5 or 6. I think my guess is this Q2 was a little better than we thought, but luck of the draw a little bit, but still trending in a positive ratio there.\n\n---\n\nOkay. In our last question, you gave a lot of great details on e-Commerce and the evolution there. What about flexible store fulfillment and reserve and pickup and ship-from-store? Is that on the horizon? Is it something your customer appreciates? And will that be a material driver of traffic? At some competitors, e-Com contributes 100 basis points or more to comp.\n\n---\n\nYes, well, 23% of growth on $3 billion is like 6 60 [ph] or whatever -- $500 million. So that's like a little under 0.5% of comp to the company. We -- first of all, we don't do it right now. With the exception of 8 or 9 Costco business centers that we have that we both deliver and order for pickup, some of the things we're testing like Google and the cart are something enhanced. But it's not like you can't call Costco or go online at Costco and say, \"I want to order this stuff, and I'll come and pick it up.\" So I don't know if our member appreciates it. I know there's a lot of effort out there doing it. Our first order of business is get -- we just are installing the membership module, which includes a lot of hooks to things. But I don't see us doing that for the -- certainly in the next year.\n\n---\n\nTwo, actually. One, just give me the evidence that gas prices correlate either to customers' willingness spend more on food, sundries and hardlines in your stores or your ability to sign up more members at your clubs when gas prices are either moving up or moving down.\n\n---\n\nWell, it used to be when prices were moving up, and it was the topic du jour every night on the -- from the consumer product and -- the consumer activist on the local news stations. When prices were skyrocketing is when we saw some real sign-ups related to that market. Conversely, you see less of that right now. Certainly, we're seeing -- the answer is I don't know completely. But certainly, we're seeing more traffic to the gas stations, more and continued strong shopping frequency in the 4 walls of the warehouse. And some of that's got to be related to that, but I couldn't tell you how much.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And my second question is on the credit card. Can you give us a sense to what the private label credit card penetration is in your clubs?\n\n---\n\nI don't think we disclose that. Total credit card -- in the U.S., total credit card is about 40, debit's about 40. Cash, check and other is about 20.\n\n---\n\nAnd -- but presumably, a big portion is private label?\n\n---\n\nProbably -- certainly more than half. But there are people that choose -- using our current thing. There are people that choose to get Starwood points or Delta points on a different Amex card than the Costco one. Our goal, though, is to certainly drive more of it, and we have successfully historically. And hopefully, we do that in the future to drive more of it to this top-of-wallet card.\n\n---\n\nI guess I have 2 questions for you. The first one is, when you look at the impact of FX this quarter throughout the P&L, can you just help us understand a little better like what we should expect both on MFI and on SG&A over the coming quarters as we look at the foreign exchange where we are today? And the second question is, with gas prices rising a bit over the past few weeks, are you adjusting the merchandise pricing that quickly to reflect the movement in gas? As you'd -- we're opportunistic this quarter with gas prices going up, will you change things as we go into the next few weeks, given the rising prices?\n\n---\n\nThe answer to the last one is no. And again, I'm not -- I can't tell you all exactly what, when and where and how. But did it give us a little bit of cover to be aggressive? Yes. Did it give us a lot? No. It gave us a lot of cover, but we chose not to use it. So, I mean, it's not like we're going to say, \"Hey, let's take all this and go use it.\" So, yes. As gas profits come down, that was part of our improvement. It so happened that this quarter, one of the reasons I pointed out of all those other things, some of which will continue to hit. You guys can figure out FX based on where the currencies of each country are. If it weakens a little bit relative to the dollar from a year ago, it's a little more impactful. If it weakens a little less, it's a little less impactful, but still with a negative in front of it. Interest income and others, a little bit of a crapshoot. It goes both ways. Gas, we know, is going to be less outsized profitable in the coming quarters. And there's no reason to -- hopefully that sales will continue to drive in the right direction. I think, overall, I look at Q2, and taking all the good of gas out and the negatives as well as other things, some of that will go away in Q3, but if we can drive sales and frequency, we'll be fine.\n\n---\n\nTwo questions. One is -- I know really it's just a lot of moving pieces, but if you were to look at gas and how much that helps EPS this quarter, could you give a range? Or if it was $0.10 and then sort of think about it going forward, if gas was steady, is that something you sort of -- you have to cycle, it comes back, or is it something that's a new plan? And then my other question was on gross margin. I think I heard you say that in ancillary, there was pharmacy and maybe something else where there was some margin expansion. Could you help explain that if I heard that right?\n\n---\n\nSure. We're not going to give specifics on gas. It was very profitable. A little bit -- it can be an offset to other margins. A lot of it is just outsized. And -- but then we also had a few other things that went our -- that went the other way. So that outsize, this was a less outsized. In terms of gross margin, optical and hearing aids. Again, just looking -- just like I say in the quarter, gas was the big one, but several other key ancillary business also had slightly improving margins year-over-year, pharmacy, optical and hearing aid.\n\n---\n\nAnd that -- what drove that? Was there an excess [indiscernible] or...\n\n---\n\nI think some of it -- I think it's driving sales -- a big chunk of it is driving sales. I think in hearing aids, and I'm guessing here because I don't know, our success of our Kirkland Signature, which is an incredible value and quality, I'm told that the penetration of that is huge. Generally, we make more margin and save the customer more money on our private label, but I'm guessing at that one.\n\n---\n\nAnd I guess just because it's flanked a little bit. Where are we now with inflation for the whole store if you were to roll it together? Beefs up and electronics down and all that kind of stuff?\n\n---\n\nYear-to-date, we're about 0.5% deflationary. And that's a LIFO index for U.S. inventory. So what were all like items cost us on day 1 of this fiscal year? And one of these same items cost us on day 180-ish or whatever of this year. And if on day 1, it was 100.00. At the end of 24 weeks, it was 0.995. So literally, 0.5%. You had a little bit of inflation in sundries and apparel and domestics. You had deflation, as you expect, in majors. You had deflation in gas. And you had deflation in food and sundries a little bit -- in food a little bit. Sundries were up a little. Food was down a little. So not a lot of inflation.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to just ask about international for a moment. I think we've been -- you've been in Spain now for about a year. Just was curious for a little update there, update on what you're thinking about new countries. I believe France was going to be next. And also just, more generally, just store productivity. When you're opening internationally, are you still kind of achieving and exceeding the targets that you've set out?\n\n---\n\nWell, in Asia and Australia, historically, we've achieved and exceeded -- recognizing whenever you're in a new country, and I would go back -- I'll use Japan as an example, 15, 18 years ago -- 15 years ago. Our original plan there was to open a unit a year for 5 years and just to achieve breakeven at the end of year 5. I think we ended up opening 6 in 5 years, and we achieved breakeven at the end of the year 4 roughly. And a lot of that has to do with you've got a $5-plus-million a year net on central expense, buyers, carrying department, small IT department, you name it, and then, of course, all of the inefficiencies of starting up. Membership-wise, we're doing great in Spain. We have 1 unit, mind you. Sales-wise, we were a little under our plan, but it's growing -- starting to finally grow nicely. I think now that we're there to stay, we've got 2 openings planned for the remaining part of this calendar year, one -- both of them in the Madrid area. And what dates are those?\n\n---\n\nOne is September.\n\n---\n\nOne's in September, and one is later that year?\n\n---\n\nYes, in the fall.\n\n---\n\nI think they're both in the fall. And again, what we find, even if it's in different cities, once we're there, you start getting more local vendors willing to sell you because we're going to be around. And you get a little more play in the press. So we'll see. But we feel good about going so far. France, we're still, at least, a year away from opening. I think when we first sat down 4-or-so years ago, the view was that Spain would take 3 to 5 years and France would take 3 to 8 years, and it is. So it's just a long drawn-out process of permitting and the whole appeals process over there by third parties. \r\nAnd I thank you for listening for 1.5 hours, and have a good day.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nI guess my first question is, when you look at your gas business today, clearly, it's a bucket for you guys to pull from to invest back in pricing for you guys to kind of be like Costco, if you will. Is there a way to quantify that this quarter? I mean, clearly, the core margins within the 80% of the business being down 3 basis points, was there some impact from you guys being more aggressive on price? Or if you can maybe just speak there thematically.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI think, qualitatively, it allowed us to be a little more aggressive. We just didn't say, \"Hey, take this extra money and put it at all there.\" We didn't. We certainly benefited from it in the quarter. And again, it's not like we looked at it as, that will be an offset to FX, as an example, because we know that FX has still got -- even if FX rates continue to stay where they are right now and don't get any relatively weaker, it's still on a relative basis in Q3 and 4 are going to be relatively weaker. So we recognize that Q3 and 4 will be a little more challenged in that regard. But certainly, could margins have been up a few instead of down a few? Probably, but who knows?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nOkay. Fair enough. And then when you look to March of next year and the change in tenders, it's my understanding there's roughly 750 million U.S. Visa cardholders today, and there's roughly 50 million Amex holders today in the U.S. How big an opportunity this could be for you guys to expand your membership base when you move into next year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, look, we'll see. I mean, there's a lot of unknowns. The first order of business is for Citi to work with American Express and figure out the account portfolio. A lot hinges on that. We expect that to happen, but there's no guarantees. And there'll be -- and again, there's a lot I'd like to tell you. There's a lot we'll figure out now. We know the bucket of dollars, if you will, in our mind, of what we can use to drive usage of that kind of card, recognizing there'll be some cannibalization. Somebody that has a Visa Mileage card in their wallet that may want to use that instead. Just like there's cannibalization now. There's people that use a non-cobranded Amex card. Similar, there'll be other places where there's outside spend increase because your neighborhood dry cleaner, one card is accepted and another card is not. So there's lots -- I think there's lots of opportunities, and we have to get there first. And first order of business is the transition itself. And we'll -- there'll be a lot more to say once we get there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just last question on e-commerce, up 23% in the quarter. Can you just remind us the number of SKUs online today relative to a year ago and where you think that can go? How much is crossing through your depots versus not? And then just margins on e-commerce relative to the clubs.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nIt's probably approaching 8,000 regular SKUs. I'm excluding from that that we have a lot of tire SKUs based on all the sizes. We've got a lot of office product SKUs through a third party. But the core SKUs on our side is 8,000, probably 1,500-plus more than a year ago. And I'm guessing there, but that's probably a good number. And that we're -- those increases are -- a lot are sundries items, some apparel items, things like that, trying to get you to come back on a more frequent basis. And smaller ticket items, a lot of the items we've added are items like I've mentioned versus $300 to $2,000 televisions and furniture sets.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nOkay. Any color on profitability?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nExcuse me?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nJust those margins in the e-commerce business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nMargins overall are probably a shade lower -- are a shade a lower. SG&A is a lot lower. So profitability-wise, e-commerce is a very profitable operation relative to the company as a whole.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nSo Rich, a two-part question to get at kind of the same thing. You've got some very busy clubs, and you keep increasing traffic mid-single digit every year. Do you guys spend a lot of time looking at kind of quality of experience in the club and maybe different parts of the club, right, like fresh? And with that in mind, is there an opportunity to open more clubs in the U.S. than you might have thought before, maybe cannibalize yourselves, gain share, improve the experience if some of them are too crowded. Have you guys done much work on that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, yes, in a lot of different ways, but not in terms of, let's sit down and do that today at one time. I mean, first of all, quality of the experience, as you, I think, know -- I'm sure you know, our operators and our merchants are in the warehouses a lot. Craig and a random set of merchandising and operating executives just spent 2 days schlumping around part of the country visiting warehouses, both us and competition and other things, and looking at new sites. So I think, certainly, the number of responses that we get every day, the types of throughput per hour at the front-end register, all those things go into that. And I got to tell you, when a member writes a little complaint, doesn't have to be nasty, just a complaint, it gets heard. And recognizing we have -- we're always going to have some challenges. So we're constantly looking for that experience. We're constantly looking for that -- to get you out of there faster and to make it a better experience. I've got to tell you, we still get probably more positives than negatives in terms of e-mails that are sent in to senior management about positive experiences with -- a member with a particular employee who -- that helped in the warehouse or somebody who went above and beyond. So we have no illusion that we'll do everything right, but we're pretty steadfast of looking at all those things. In terms of willing to open more units, absolutely. I mean, if you would ask me 5 years ago when we were opening about 20 units a year, and probably -- I don't have the numbers in front of me, but probably it was 70-30 U.S. And you said, \"Richard, 5 years hence, where are you going to be?\" And I'd say, well, we're going to be about 30. And we actually got there, pretty close. And if it's 70-30 U.S. back then, it's probably 50-50 heading to 30-70 over the next 5 years. And here we are, almost 60-40, still in the U.S. I think that's a reflection that we're finding probably more opportunities than we thought possible. Some of it's what you mentioned, opening up in busy -- that quality of experience, the units that are 250 and 300 and even a few that are 300-plus, trying to get those in. We're trying to balance that because cannibalization does cause a little heartburn for a year. But a lot of it also is in, I think, surprising how many units we can put in some of the newer markets. And that newer is a relative term. Newer markets over the last -- in markets that we've been in for the last 5 or 10 years. And so I think it's a combination of all that. Again, last year, I think of that 20 -- in fact, I have it here, hold on. Of the -- here it is. Of the 20 -- in fiscal '13 -- sorry, last year, of the 29 net openings we had, I think 16 were in the U.S. And this year, of the 28 -- or 16 or 17 are in the U.S., so a little over half. And this year, it's -- what did I say? 17 out of 28, so almost 2/3. And so I think you'll -- probably, 5 years from now, as we go from, let's say, 30 to 35, probably still half are in the U.S., and we're finding more opportunities.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nDo you think you can get to 1,000 there ultimately? Or you maybe have not gone out that far?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, we haven't gone out that far off yet. Yes, if you mean -- if you added 30 -- even 30 a year for 10 years, you're in a sense there. So yes, I think so. That's certainly not out of the realm.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nAll right. And then secondly, what's the thought -- at least, it seems like anecdotally, maybe in certain items or categories, there may be a Kirkland introduced, maybe the brand or a brand is no longer carried. I don't think there's a conscious effort to -- although the quality and value of Kirkland certainly outstrips a lot of the brands, a conscious effort to get more Kirkland items in the store more space to them. Is there a conscious effort? Or that's just kind of it happens? You put it in, it's where the demand is and so maybe it squeezes out some brands along the way.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, I think, there's an ongoing conscious effort to -- there are people that are in charge of coming up with new Kirkland stuff in each merchandise category. And their job is to try to find new things, just like any buyer's job is to find good, exciting branded items. And ultimately, an item -- it is our cousin. It has Kirkland name on it, but it has to live and die like any other item. I think if we've added 30 or 40 items in the past 12 or 18 months, I bet you we've subtracted 20 or 30 that ultimately didn't work out. Then we bring back some a few years later that worked better. I remember years ago, we had an organic peanut butter Kirkland Signature that didn't set the world on fire. I think we're now testing it again, and it's a pretty good item. But we'll see how long pretty good means. So yes, we're -- it has to -- we recognize the strength of our concept is both KS and brand. And I don't think we -- if you said, \"Richard, you're at -- in the mid-20s now in terms of KS, do you ever see it going to 50?\" That's a stretch. I mean, even our own numbers internally when we say, \"How can we get it from 25 to 30?\" There's no formal game plan how many years is that going to take. It's what items work. And certainly, there's not a lot of low-hanging fruit. There's lots of $20 million and $30 million and $50 million items over time, not a lot of $300 million and $400 million items like paper goods or water and things like that or K-cups. And last comment before getting to the next question out there. In terms of cannibalization, even if that's ramped up a little bit, I was just looking over the last few years, if you go back to fiscal '13, what we call cannibalization, that's just not just here. That's opening 3 units in Japan, and that affects 3 or 5 other Japanese units. Total cannibalization in fiscal '13 was 65 basis points and '14 58 basis points. And for the first half of this year, it looks like it's about something in the low 40s. So it's going to fluctuate between 35 and 75, depending on what we do and where we do it. But my guess is something in the 40 to 50 range is kind of -- we're not going to be able to move that number overall a lot, okay? Next question?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nIt's Dan Binder. My question -- my first question is related to the gas business. Can you just give us an update on where the comp gallons were in the quarter, where gas is as a percentage of the total sales? And then you mentioned that the gas margin would start to be a little bit less favorable given where price is, what prices are doing. Can you help us just understand kind of what the excess margin may have been to EPS this quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes, look, it was -- just on that line item, it was 2/3 of the margin improvement of all ancillary businesses. It could be 200-plus basis points of extra margin. I mean, our margins in gas on a daily basis over the years could be anywhere from a 0 to 5 or 6. And it's all over the board. Might even be a little higher sometimes. But it really ranges. And frankly, when it's a little higher, we're saving the customer more money. In terms of gallonage comps, I remember, for a couple of years, when the U.S. overall, not Costco, but all U.S. vehicle gallonage consumption was in the low-single digits and maybe when the bad economy hit, it went to the low negative single digits. And we went from -- we remained at 4, 5, 6, 7. Right now, we're in the mid-teens. So we're getting a lot of people coming in to Costco to buy gas. And that certainly drives them into the warehouse as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nThen on the IT spend, you mentioned that -- I think you said it was $0.02 this quarter. As you look at Q3 and 4, what do you expect that impact to look like?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nIt's hard to guess completely. I know we've had a couple of -- some of the original modules. And modules makes it sound like it's a small number. These are big numbers. But yes, you have projects that are $50 million, $60 million projects that the day they're put into service, they then, over the next, in our case, 55 [ph] 4-week periods, over the next 5 years, generally, you take a little under $1 million a month hit. And so some of those are starting to hit. So my guess is, it will -- is it that much? Is a little enough? It's hard to say. But still over a several-year period, incrementally recognizing your denominator, sales, keep getting bigger, too. But even with that bigger sales, we had indicated something in the low to mid-teens of basis points. I can be off by a couple of basis points, but it ain't cheap.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nAnd then my last question was related to organics. Can you just give us an update on how many SKUs are in the club in at this point? What the mix is of sales and how that performed in the quarter, kind of what you're thinking about that business going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes. It's still a small percentage of Costco. It's a rising -- but it's a fast-growing area as it is with a lot of other retailers as well. You're going to see more and more of it. A part of that's availability. We could sell -- we and everybody else could sell a lot more if there was more out there. I think we're doing a pretty good job of lining up our sourcing. And I think I mentioned last quarter that for all of '14, organic was like approaching $3 billion, which was more than twice what it was 2 years earlier, 1.5 years earlier. It's growing fast. I don't know if it's 50% a year, but it's certainly growing at a high -- at a mid -- a low mid or mid-double-digit number. And it's great for us because we show even a better value on that stuff than some of the things that it replaces. When we can do organic ground beef, where everybody football's regular ground beef, and everybody makes a lower-than-average margin, this is the item that everybody tries to make more on. And so we can make a little more, not a lot more, and show a greater value to our member. So it'll keep growing. Sorry, I can't be more specific.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Becks (Analysts)】\nIt's Mark Becks on for Chris. Just a follow-up on a couple of Chuck's questions, actually. So it doesn't look like you're getting into too much specifics about the change in that credit card, AMX, et cetera. Just curious, what has been the response that you've seen from our friends up north? I know that sort of changed over in January. Maybe what the reception has been there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, it's been good so far. I mean, we're getting a lot of people to switch, recognizing it's people's membership card as well. And if anything, our view of the U.S. should be -- I guess, I can't get into a lot of it right now. We wouldn't have done this if I thought there was a lot of risk associated with it. We think it's a big positive over a long period of time, but recognizing big positives to us means giving most of it back to the customer, in this case, most of it back to the co-branded user of a credit card. And that's going to happen. We're really not going to be able to tell you a lot about it for a number of months.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Becks (Analysts)】\nOkay. I guess I'll switch back to the gas prices then. Historically, the adage has been you guys benefit when prices go up. But it looks like, just based on gallonage and then mileage driven, which has only been up a couple of percent, that you guys are actually capturing a lot more share now than in sort of history period. Would you -- Is that something you would agree with?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes. No, there's 2 prices to that, just so everybody understands. When prices go up, we make less and save the customer. We still save them but save them less. When prices go down, we save them more, and we make more. Certainly, prices going down, we save the customer more, and that's positive. And we make a little more -- or a lot more, right, of -- that's changed in the last few weeks. But we made a lot more in the last few quarters. If you go -- the other thing -- the thing, I think, you're talking about is when -- it was in the press every day. As prices went from $3 to $4 to $4-plus dollars a gallon, it was on the news every night in every city. That helped us, I think. The offset to that would be as prices are less important, how can that help you? I don't know, other than it is. And it is a lot because our gallon's just quite a bit up.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Becks (Analysts)】\nDid you say what the volume and gallonage was? I think it was, call it up, 11% last quarter.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nIt was in the mid-teens, I think, we mentioned.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Becks (Analysts)】\nOkay. Yes. So pretty big acceleration there. And then just finally on geography...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes, by the way, just getting back to that comment. I think you people ask us why? I think it's because we do a good job of being the most competitive price. There's that third-party, it's gasbody.com, that 40-whatever million people input their price to what they bought gas for, for 2 years in a row since they started announcing best overall low price out there by $0.14 Or $0.16 a gallon across the country. Now you're going to -- that's not every station, every day, everywhere. But on average, with all those data points, we're in. I think that kind of publicity helps us as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Mark Becks (Analysts)】\nNow, that makes perfect sense. And then just the last question on sort of geographical differences. It looks like you caught out the Midwest, then the South area as the strongest. Obviously, a lot of moving pieces there with the Chinese New Year that helped. But then the port shutdowns, which, on our math, comes out to 60 basis points roughly. Maybe just sort of what you're seeing. Elaborate a little bit geography, and then maybe the Northeast. I know we've seen some pretty severe weather here as of late.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, look, I think you summed up what we summed up on the port strike and the Lunar New Year switch. Yes, I think the big deal is that weather has played a role, although we -- it did last year as well. But if I look at New York -- the Northeast as an example, the 4 weeks that comprised February, the first 2 weeks were mid-positive single, and the last 2 weeks were mid-negative single-digit. That's a huge swing. But other areas did just fine. The Texas region got hammered last week with weather, but overall, we're -- it's -- we've done okay.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simeon Gutman (Analysts)】\nA couple of quick ones. On the credit card, I know you're not going to share a lot of details. Is there -- besides, probably, some savings just from some lower interchange fees or credit card fees, is there any elevators such that if there's certain volumes met, you could see benefits -- further benefits down the road? Or is this the lower fees, you'll see a benefit upfront? And then from there, just how much business you do?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nAs you are asking, I'm looking at my wall behind me, and there's a handwritten note from many years ago when our Securities Counsel was sitting here. He quickly -- if somebody's asking a question, he wrote, \"We have no comment beyond the release.\" The reality is, there's lots of buttons that you push on these agreements. There's all aspects of it. At the end of the day, whatever our current arrangement -- as we look at it, whatever our current arrangement is with our current provider, both what we pay, what we receive to offset some of that, what our member using that co-brand cardholder is rewarded, we start with a premise of how much is that to start with? What do we think we can go to? At the end of the day, we can -- whatever that bucket of money is, it can go towards lowering merchant fees, raising rewards or using some other place in our company. We'll figure it out. There's -- we think that's an exciting bucket, and we'll do a lot with it. But just like I've told people in the past, if we can save $1 on buying a product better, whether it's detergent or coffee or anything or due to packaging or raw materials cost or energy costs, we're going to give $0.80, $0.90 back to the customer. And rest assured, there'll be -- whatever benefit x is, a little bit of it will accrue to our P&L and a lot of it will accrue to the member in some way, shape or form. But none of that -- we can't really tell you until next year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simeon Gutman (Analysts)】\nThat's fine. That makes sense. On membership, I know you don't say a lot international versus U.S. But can you just speak directionally to whatever growth rate you're seeing in membership, whatever trend line has been occurring? How is that? Has it changed much? Is it the same in the U.S. versus international?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nIt's higher international because we're newer. Needless to say -- and I think I've shared in the past. I mean, if you take the total number of members divided by our total number of warehouses, you've got roughly 59,000, 60,000 member households per warehouse. In Japan, you've got a number that has -- is a 3-digit number. It's 100 -- in the low 100s. You also have a higher -- a lower renewal rate in those first few years. So it tends to balance out over time, but we operate overall in other countries on a membership fee as a higher percentage of sales, particularly in Asia.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simeon Gutman (Analysts)】\nBut whatever prevailing growth rate there has been in membership in the U.S. up until second quarter or up until the first meeting, has that run rate stayed the same in the U.S.?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes, again, a lot of it is dictated by new openings. And again, it's going to be dictated more by -- when I said new member sign-ups in the quarter were up 9%, there've been times when it's been almost flat. But part of that -- or down a little bit because a year earlier in that quarter, you opened 3 units in Asia, where you might have -- and again, I talked about an average of roughly 60,000 member households per location. We've had locations that will have new member sign-ups as of opening day. And that as of opening day means during the 8 or 10 or 12 weeks prior to opening when the parking lot is kind of set, and we have the flags and the tabling activities out front side. You could have anywhere from 25,000 to 40,000 members signed up. Now 40% of market renewal a year later, but in terms of new members coming in and buying a membership, and that really distorts that number. So I don't know how much meaning -- that plus 9 is a function of that as well, but we always point that out.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simeon Gutman (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just very quickly, can you just remind us on the e-commerce business. Is there other member-only items or meaning -- or is there items someone can just -- that's not a member can come on the website and purchase as well?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nIt is crazy world. There are some items that we have online where we have agreed not to show the price unless you're a member.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simeon Gutman (Analysts)】\nOkay. Not to show the price. But the only person who's buying on your website is a member?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nI wanted to just touch on membership as well, certainly with consistent and strong traffic. And you certainly are saving people money at the palm. How are you thinking about the value proposition of your membership currently in the U.S. and international? What may be the timeline in terms of you kind of reassessing what you think the value of the membership should be?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, I think, at a roundabout what you're asking about when do we see this, I think, there is a possibility of a fee change. Historically, that, really, we think about last. We drive prices and value every day in everything we do. And I mean it. If you go to our budget meetings every 4 weeks, and you've got a 1.5 days, and 1/2 of that time or 1/3 of that time is merchants. And we're figuring out how to improve the value and lower the price and raise the quality. And historically, using U.S. and Canada as 80% of our business, first of all, and probably 80-ish -- a little different than that number, but pretty close in terms of percent of members, you have a -- we've done a fee increase about every 5 or 6 years. The last one we did was in very late '11, very early '12. So during the -- most of the calendar year of '12, those renewers, for the first time in 5 or 6 years, saw a fee increase from 50 to 55 and from 100 to 110 on the executive in the U.S. and Canada. If history repeats itself, 5 to 6 years from January of '12 would be January of '17 into January of '18. So that, again, based on history, doesn't mean we're going to do or not going to do it. We've chosen generally to hold membership fees at whatever their prices are, mostly other countries, in part, because it's so darn strong to start with, and why not continue to drive the business? And so, again, I think, it's generally the last thing we look at, but something we've looked at regularly over 30 years. And I'm sure we'll look at it again when the time is right.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nSounds good. And then just circling back to gas profitability. I know you've addressed this a few times on the call, but given the spread between the street's forecast and the actual for 2Q, I just wanted to touch back on your comments around the third quarter. You mentioned that gas prices have started to trickle back up. But frankly, can you help us just kind of think about our expectations for the back half of the year? Should it be closer to a more normalized cadence around gasoline profitability? Or do you continue to see a little bit of tailwind given the favorable mix?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, if you look at history, when we -- each quarter for the last several years, we'll share with people that gas helped us a little, hurt us a little, helped us a lot, hurt us a lot, it's all -- it's virtually all -- it's pretty much in proportion with the trend of gas prices per gallon. And so, as you know, the constant drive-down has stopped, and it should've been up a little bit. So a lot of that party is now behind us for right now. And -- but I can't really tell you what it's going to be other than, historically, that's what it's been.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Fassler (Analysts)】\nIt's Matt Fassler. First question relates to the special dividend. I guess, this is our first conference call since you announced the last one. With prior special dividend, it was around the time of tax policy change, and many companies pursued that tack. As you take a bigger picture look now at capital allocation, understanding that you did accelerate the stock buyback a bit, how are you thinking about special dividends, perhaps, as a recurring element of capital allocation? And any other light you want to share on your decision to issue that one last week?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, I mean, we now have 2 data points instead of 1. We did it. And you're right, the motivation or one of the motivations for doing it when we did it was reading about in the Wall Street Journal every day and just before people expected a dividend tax rate to go up dramatically. So it made sense to be not only shareholder-friendly but shareholder-friendly in a way that might help people as well if tax rates were going to change and be proactive about that. I think we appreciate the fact that it was perceived as being shareholder-friendly. As you might expect, both management and the Board wanted to continue to do things in that regard. And it's not like we sat down and did this giant study exactly when, how much and what should we do. I think we liked it the first time, and it seems like our shareholders liked it the second time. I'm not trying to be cute or coy about it. They're a little independent of each other. I think when we did the first one, which was a little over $3 billion worth, it was quite sizable. It was a time when, I guess, in retrospect, we could've bought some more stock back. It would've been a smart thing to do given where it's at now. But we wanted -- we tend to do both. And we tend to look all things, first and foremost, CapEx, how can we ramp up CapEx, and we've done that. Second would be our regular dividend, what are we going to do with that every year? Again, there's no guarantees. But in each of the last spring periods over the last 9 years, I think we've raised it, on average, around 13.5%. We looked -- as you know, from your models and our models, we are generating more cash than we can use in CapEx. And so we'll continue to look at ways to be shareholder-friendly. And -- but there's no reason to think it will be 2 years, hence, we'll do another one. But as always, we think we will. We'll see.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Fassler (Analysts)】\nIt's interesting. Even though you're running with several billion dollars of cash on the balance sheet, you have come to the debt markets, which, I understand, is opportunistic. Should we think about the cash balance that you have today as something that you feel you need to be comfortable with? Or is that a number that you can whittle down over time?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, I think it's a number we could whittle down. Mind you, I'm looking at quarter end. This number might be a shade different than the balance sheet number, but I think we had cash and short-term investments of -- it was in the press release number there. Hold on a second. Actually, we had cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter of $7.4 billion roughly and add a number that wasn't completely consolidated like $7.2 billion. But if you look at that roughly $7.4 billion number, about $2.5 billion is real cash in the U.S. Another $2.5 billion, $3 billion is real cash outside the U.S. where we're spending it, frankly. In addition, we announced last year that we brought back some of the cash in Canada. So I think we can whittle the number down, but it's -- I guess some of it's cash equivalents. If you think about -- from the time banks closed on Friday night to the time they open on Monday morning, all those debit and credit receivables, which could be upwards of $1 billion, $1.5 billion -- $1 billion-plus, that is a cash equivalent, but it's not cash.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Fassler (Analysts)】\nGot it. That's very helpful. And then just a very quick follow-up. We're seeing the LIFO metric creep up. I know it's only a couple of basis points, but it's a nice change from a year ago when, I guess, you peaked at around an 8 basis point hit. Could you just talk about what the moving pieces are in driving that? I know you feel like you're fully marked at the end of any given quarter, but if you had to place bets, which direction that would go for the rest of the year? It'd be very helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI don't know. Gas has come up a little bit, although it's still below where it was at the beginning of the year. So that's still probably -- as of today, it's LIFO-creditable. I don't think it's going to be a big, giant number either way, but it's a little bit of a crapshoot at this point. Yes, by the way, Matt, a part of it is some proteins are inflationary right now for not all reasons related. And then some other things, we're just starting to see the beginnings of some deflationary pressure on items manufactured with oil, plastic bags and the like. So some of that is starting to finally flow through. So there'll be some things that are inflationary and some that are deflationary.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kelly Bania (Analysts)】\nI'm not sure if it's too early to ask this, but just curious about the members that you brought in via the LivingSocial promotion several months ago. Just curious if you're tracking them following -- are they following that typical spending pattern of a new member in terms of spending and frequency?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI'm going to punt because I don't know the answer to that. But if you hold that question for next quarter, I promise we'll have some numbers. I know that we are tracking it, and I just don't have the detail on it. I know that, on average, they are a little younger. I don't know spend habits.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kelly Bania (Analysts)】\nOkay. Then just another one. You mentioned the Bay Area as, I think, a strong region either in the quarter or for the month. Just -- I know that's an area where you have more robust offering in organics. Just curious if that's part of it. And maybe are -- how plans are to kind of bring that more robust organic offering to some more clubs in the rest of the country?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, that's probably a little piece of it. I think weather, overall, has helped. The West Coast, as bad as it's been in Texas and the Midwest and the East Coast, it's been offsettingly good over on our side of the country. And I'm sure that's helped some. Clearly, I think, some of the merchandising efforts we've done on organics has helped. Part of that, we are doing it more in other parts of the country. Part of it is supply issues, and it will still take time for that to grow.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nLet me go back to e-Commerce and then the ancillary services x gas. And just explore -- I know, I think, you said that the margins are great. Did you give us a number on how big e-Commerce is?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nNo. It's -- you mean total size of e-Commerce?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nIt's about 3% of our total.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\n3% of your total sales?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nOn an annualized basis, I think last year, it was 2.9-something.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\n$3 billion and growing at 20%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\n$3 billion and going 20%, 25%. And then from a gross margin perspective, I mean, how do we think about SG&A associated with that business? Is there much of it? I mean, is it like fractional? A couple of percent? I mean, how do we think of SG&A when you look at it. I know a lot of stuff just goes directly to the consumer. About 60% of it is the -- is there really a lot of SG&A associated?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nNo, there's -- margins are a -- let me just look here. Margins are a shade lower, not a lot. And SG&A is a lot lower.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nOkay. Okay. So -- and then from a philosophical -- everyone's always ragged on -- or not ragged on, that way. Everyone's always -- there are some people who have criticized Costco because they don't let enough flow through to shareholders. How do we think about that? I think the gross margins are -- what you're saying, a little bit lower. SG&A is a lot lower. So net-net, we got much better operating profit in the e-Commerce business. Is that okay with the company? Or is that something that you would try to make look like the rest of it -- rest of the business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nNo, look, I don't -- I mean, we're retailers. There's different parts of it. No, we're happy to make a little more there. We're still making -- first and foremost, are we as competitive as we can be relative to others? And we feel that we are very competitive. We're also recognizing that e-commerce is supported by the buying strength of the  warehouses. As we brought inline electronics and furniture and some of those bigger-ticket categories, that buying strength, how do you compensate -- how does e-Commerce, if you will, compensate for that? So it's all part of the same thing. The fact that its margins overall are a little lower than the warehouses, I think, is indicative -- is a function of that. And we'll continue to do that. We work on a strong profit than some of the other ancillary businesses, but they also have different either costs associated with it or purchasing powers. Pharmacies, of course, you've got pharmacists and pharmacy techs that make more than your average hourly employees. So you've got a higher cost structure there as well as all the regulatory and billing stuff going on in that business. So we work on a higher margin to offset some of that, but we also work on a profitability number that's good. So it's all part of the equation, if you will.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nSure. Then just one last one. So I think you said you're up to 8,000 SKUs. One of the things we think benefits Costco hugely on the e-Commerce is that you're basically willing to use your people to do the shopping for me. In other words, like the fact that there isn't 2 million SKUs like there is on Wal-Mart site, I think, is a great attribute. So what's your thought about where the SKU count goes, kind of balancing Costco being a personal shopper versus wanting more, maybe more SKUs? Where do you think it goes?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, I think it probably goes up a little bit, but not a lot. The fact that it went from 4,000 to 8,000 or something in the last few years is a lot. But part of that was just trying to drive business -- adding some categories to get people -- for people to think of it as top-of-mind or near top-of-mind instead of not at all. If I had to think about a comment from a very loyal shareholder and somebody who loves Costco with 3 kids at home, 3 teenagers and said, \"Look, I love Costco. And I know when I go into a warehouse, I know I'm going to get the 10 items I planned to get in the food and sundries area and the other 10 that I didn't plan to get. But I know I'm going to come out with 20. I'm going to be sated. I know I'm going to have great food samples. I know we'll get 3 other things I'm not wearing and I had no plans to get them. And I'm excited about that, but I knew, going in, I was going to get 3 or 4 items that I didn't plan on getting. But when I go to -- gosh, I don't know why -- when do I go to costco.com?\" So part of our challenge in the west here on costco.com is not only driving sales of those bigger physical ticket -- bigger dollar ticket and physical ticket items that not everybody wants to shop home, like furniture and big-screen TVs and have a great price and a great, in many case, white glove service delivery. And we're driving that business. But also, how do we get you there more regularly? And whether it's K-cups and other items for your office or home or some apparel items, as you know, the 5.5 million KS sweatshirts that we sell every year, which is a great value. If you -- I always joked, if you're really tall with shorter arms, we cannot serve you because we don't sell all the sizes -- size and sleeve -- and color combinations.  Online, we do. So trying to get different reasons to get you onto the site more often is part of the equation here. And I think we're doing a pretty good job of doing that. But I don't see -- if you said, \"Richard, do you think you can get to 50,000 one day?\" Gosh, I don't see it in my near future.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Oliver Chen (Analysts)】\nI just had a bigger-picture question about holiday. Did you have -- would you prioritize any major learnings from holiday in terms of where you might look to do things differently next year? And then on the core merchandising margins number, what should we look at as helpful drivers for that positively going forward? Or what kind of run rate might we expect there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWhat were you saying, what was the second part of that question?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Oliver Chen (Analysts)】\nThe core merchandise margins. What are some of the positive drivers we should look for in terms of optimism on the core merchandise margins? Whether it be inventory control? Or is the run rate at a slight negative, kind of realistic for us to model?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, needless to say, we don't provide -- on the latter part, we don't provide specific direction in that area. I remember, several years ago, when our margins were just down year-over-year every quarter for a couple of years, and every quarter we'd say, \"Margins are fine. We can tweak them a little bit if we want to and when we want to.\" I think that sentence -- that response is still there. I think we are -- we continue to get excited by strong sales and strong loyalty and strong conversion to executive member. And all those things will continue to take front seat to a little margin improvement. But if we want to get a little bit, we think we can while still being very competitive. In terms of what have we learned or not learned during the holiday, I think when we look back, I think we did a pretty good job of planning for the port slowdowns. And arguably, it's probably easier to do a better job when you're managing fewer items. And so while we got hurt by it a little bit, I think we probably mitigated that hurt. Beyond that, again, I think we are comfortable when raw materials prices and  bakery and food court and the like go up, that we're not going to change our prices. And if it hurts our margin a little bit, it hurts it. We can get it elsewhere. So I don't think there -- this was not -- given our strength, we didn't -- there weren't a lot of things necessarily learned as it relates to did sales soften and we drive more sales by more markdowns or something. I think we probably came out of this season pretty good and, if anything, we'll continue to be aggressive in terms of the types of products, the price points of products that -- our member wants great value or great items. And we'll continue to drive value the proposition in upscale items.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Oliver Chen (Analysts)】\nYes, that sounds encouraging. And inventories were nicely growing versus sales, like underpinning sales. Is that a trend we should also model going forward in terms of the spread being neutral?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nProbably a little bit. Again, I wouldn't read too much into one quarter. For a number of years here, we've generally -- again, taking FX, gas out of it, which is the 4 walls of warehouse inventories on a non-FX-dilutive or increased basis. Generally speaking, we've had sales greater than inventory per warehouse increases. Sales were up 8 or 9. Inventories were up 5 or 6. I think my guess is this Q2 was a little better than we thought, but luck of the draw a little bit, but still trending in a positive ratio there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Oliver Chen (Analysts)】\nOkay. In our last question, you gave a lot of great details on e-Commerce and the evolution there. What about flexible store fulfillment and reserve and pickup and ship-from-store? Is that on the horizon? Is it something your customer appreciates? And will that be a material driver of traffic? At some competitors, e-Com contributes 100 basis points or more to comp.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYes, well, 23% of growth on $3 billion is like 6 60 [ph] or whatever -- $500 million. So that's like a little under 0.5% of comp to the company. We -- first of all, we don't do it right now. With the exception of 8 or 9 Costco business centers that we have that we both deliver and order for pickup, some of the things we're testing like Google and the cart are something enhanced. But it's not like you can't call Costco or go online at Costco and say, \"I want to order this stuff, and I'll come and pick it up.\" So I don't know if our member appreciates it. I know there's a lot of effort out there doing it. Our first order of business is get -- we just are installing the membership module, which includes a lot of hooks to things. But I don't see us doing that for the -- certainly in the next year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nTwo, actually. One, just give me the evidence that gas prices correlate either to customers' willingness spend more on food, sundries and hardlines in your stores or your ability to sign up more members at your clubs when gas prices are either moving up or moving down.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, it used to be when prices were moving up, and it was the topic du jour every night on the -- from the consumer product and -- the consumer activist on the local news stations. When prices were skyrocketing is when we saw some real sign-ups related to that market. Conversely, you see less of that right now. Certainly, we're seeing -- the answer is I don't know completely. But certainly, we're seeing more traffic to the gas stations, more and continued strong shopping frequency in the 4 walls of the warehouse. And some of that's got to be related to that, but I couldn't tell you how much.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nOkay. And my second question is on the credit card. Can you give us a sense to what the private label credit card penetration is in your clubs?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI don't think we disclose that. Total credit card -- in the U.S., total credit card is about 40, debit's about 40. Cash, check and other is about 20.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Lasser (Analysts)】\nAnd -- but presumably, a big portion is private label?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nProbably -- certainly more than half. But there are people that choose -- using our current thing. There are people that choose to get Starwood points or Delta points on a different Amex card than the Costco one. Our goal, though, is to certainly drive more of it, and we have successfully historically. And hopefully, we do that in the future to drive more of it to this top-of-wallet card.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Drbul (Analysts)】\nI guess I have 2 questions for you. The first one is, when you look at the impact of FX this quarter throughout the P&L, can you just help us understand a little better like what we should expect both on MFI and on SG&A over the coming quarters as we look at the foreign exchange where we are today? And the second question is, with gas prices rising a bit over the past few weeks, are you adjusting the merchandise pricing that quickly to reflect the movement in gas? As you'd -- we're opportunistic this quarter with gas prices going up, will you change things as we go into the next few weeks, given the rising prices?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nThe answer to the last one is no. And again, I'm not -- I can't tell you all exactly what, when and where and how. But did it give us a little bit of cover to be aggressive? Yes. Did it give us a lot? No. It gave us a lot of cover, but we chose not to use it. So, I mean, it's not like we're going to say, \"Hey, let's take all this and go use it.\" So, yes. As gas profits come down, that was part of our improvement. It so happened that this quarter, one of the reasons I pointed out of all those other things, some of which will continue to hit. You guys can figure out FX based on where the currencies of each country are. If it weakens a little bit relative to the dollar from a year ago, it's a little more impactful. If it weakens a little less, it's a little less impactful, but still with a negative in front of it. Interest income and others, a little bit of a crapshoot. It goes both ways. Gas, we know, is going to be less outsized profitable in the coming quarters. And there's no reason to -- hopefully that sales will continue to drive in the right direction. I think, overall, I look at Q2, and taking all the good of gas out and the negatives as well as other things, some of that will go away in Q3, but if we can drive sales and frequency, we'll be fine.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nTwo questions. One is -- I know really it's just a lot of moving pieces, but if you were to look at gas and how much that helps EPS this quarter, could you give a range? Or if it was $0.10 and then sort of think about it going forward, if gas was steady, is that something you sort of -- you have to cycle, it comes back, or is it something that's a new plan? And then my other question was on gross margin. I think I heard you say that in ancillary, there was pharmacy and maybe something else where there was some margin expansion. Could you help explain that if I heard that right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nSure. We're not going to give specifics on gas. It was very profitable. A little bit -- it can be an offset to other margins. A lot of it is just outsized. And -- but then we also had a few other things that went our -- that went the other way. So that outsize, this was a less outsized. In terms of gross margin, optical and hearing aids. Again, just looking -- just like I say in the quarter, gas was the big one, but several other key ancillary business also had slightly improving margins year-over-year, pharmacy, optical and hearing aid.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nAnd that -- what drove that? Was there an excess [indiscernible] or...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI think some of it -- I think it's driving sales -- a big chunk of it is driving sales. I think in hearing aids, and I'm guessing here because I don't know, our success of our Kirkland Signature, which is an incredible value and quality, I'm told that the penetration of that is huge. Generally, we make more margin and save the customer more money on our private label, but I'm guessing at that one.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gregory Melich (Analysts)】\nAnd I guess just because it's flanked a little bit. Where are we now with inflation for the whole store if you were to roll it together? Beefs up and electronics down and all that kind of stuff?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nYear-to-date, we're about 0.5% deflationary. And that's a LIFO index for U.S. inventory. So what were all like items cost us on day 1 of this fiscal year? And one of these same items cost us on day 180-ish or whatever of this year. And if on day 1, it was 100.00. At the end of 24 weeks, it was 0.995. So literally, 0.5%. You had a little bit of inflation in sundries and apparel and domestics. You had deflation, as you expect, in majors. You had deflation in gas. And you had deflation in food and sundries a little bit -- in food a little bit. Sundries were up a little. Food was down a little. So not a lot of inflation.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Joseph Feldman (Analysts)】\nI wanted to just ask about international for a moment. I think we've been -- you've been in Spain now for about a year. Just was curious for a little update there, update on what you're thinking about new countries. I believe France was going to be next. And also just, more generally, just store productivity. When you're opening internationally, are you still kind of achieving and exceeding the targets that you've set out?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nWell, in Asia and Australia, historically, we've achieved and exceeded -- recognizing whenever you're in a new country, and I would go back -- I'll use Japan as an example, 15, 18 years ago -- 15 years ago. Our original plan there was to open a unit a year for 5 years and just to achieve breakeven at the end of year 5. I think we ended up opening 6 in 5 years, and we achieved breakeven at the end of the year 4 roughly. And a lot of that has to do with you've got a $5-plus-million a year net on central expense, buyers, carrying department, small IT department, you name it, and then, of course, all of the inefficiencies of starting up. Membership-wise, we're doing great in Spain. We have 1 unit, mind you. Sales-wise, we were a little under our plan, but it's growing -- starting to finally grow nicely. I think now that we're there to stay, we've got 2 openings planned for the remaining part of this calendar year, one -- both of them in the Madrid area. And what dates are those?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nOne is September.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nOne's in September, and one is later that year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nYes, in the fall.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Galanti (Executives)】\nI think they're both in the fall. And again, what we find, even if it's in different cities, once we're there, you start getting more local vendors willing to sell you because we're going to be around. And you get a little more play in the press. So we'll see. But we feel good about going so far. France, we're still, at least, a year away from opening. I think when we first sat down 4-or-so years ago, the view was that Spain would take 3 to 5 years and France would take 3 to 8 years, and it is. So it's just a long drawn-out process of permitting and the whole appeals process over there by third parties. \r\nAnd I thank you for listening for 1.5 hours, and have a good day.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Brandon, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to Foot Locker, Inc.'s Fourth Quarter and 2014 Full Year Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for joining us today.\r\nAs noted in this morning's press release, we reported GAAP net income of $146 million in the fourth quarter, 21% more than the $121 million that the company earned in the fourth quarter last year. On a per share basis, we earned $1.01 this year on a GAAP basis compared to $0.81 in the same period a year ago, a 25% increase.\r\nFor the full year, we topped $0.5 billion in net income for the first time in our history as an athletic company, reaching a total of $520 million. This represents a 21% increase over the $429 million that the company earned in 2013. Earnings per share improved to 25% to $3.56 from $2.85 per share.\r\nAs noted in our release, we had a onetime gain from the sale of a property as well as a write-down of a trademark. Excluding these items, fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was an even $1, a 22% increase over the $0.82 a share we earned on a non-GAAP basis last year.\r\nA reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in our press release, and except as otherwise indicated, the numbers mentioned during our remarks this morning will be based on the non-GAAP results.\r\nWith me this morning are Dick Johnson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \r\nLauren will lead off our call with a detailed look at our fourth quarter financial performance, followed by Dick, who will provide insight into some of the merchandising industry trends that led to our strong results. Lauren will wrap up our prepared remarks with an overview of our annual and quarterly expectations for 2015. \r\nAs we announced last month, we will be hosting an investor meeting here in our New York headquarters on March 16 at 2 p.m. during which we will describe our long-term strategic priorities for growth and update our financial goals. Therefore, during today's question-and-answer period, we ask that you focus your questions on our fourth quarter results and near-term outlook for 2015.\r\nLauren?\n\n---\n\nThank you, John, and good morning to you all. We really appreciate you joining us this morning as we review our 2014 results and take a first look at 2015.\r\nWhat better place to start in describing our strong fourth quarter results than with our comparable sales gain of 10.2%. This is an enormous credit to our merchants and operations team that we were able to drive such positive, and as you'll hear, broad-based and consistent results. The direct-to-customer segment led the way, as it has all year, with a 21.9% sales gain for the quarter. Within the segment, our Eastbay banner was up low double digits while our U.S. store banner dot-com businesses were collectively up over 30%. For the year, our direct business had a comparable sales gain of 17.8% with Eastbay up mid-single digits while store banner dot-com sales were up almost 40%.\r\nThe stores segment posted a strong 8.5% comparable sales gain for the quarter. Several U.S. banners produced double-digit gains led by Footaction and Foot Locker with increases in the teens followed by low double-digit gains in Kids Foot Locker, and yes, Lady Foot Locker. The gain at Lady Foot Locker was its third consecutive quarterly increase and its first double-digit gain in several years. To quote Ken's reaction, \"Oorah!\"\r\nChamps Sports was up mid-single digits as were European businesses. Elsewhere internationally, Foot Locker Asia/Pacific was up low double digits while Foot Locker Canada was up high single digits. \r\nSo very strong comparable sales gains across the board by channel, geography and gender. Our 10.2% comparable sales gain, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was partially offset by FX and other factors to bring our total sales gain to a still very healthy 6.7% in the quarter. Almost all of the 350 basis point difference between our comp gain and the total sales increase was attributable to the stronger U.S. dollar in Q4 this year compared to last year with the lack of CCS sales this year and a net 50 store count reduction by the end of the quarter, smaller contributing factors.\r\nOur monthly comp cadence was steady through the quarter. We finished November with a low double-digit comp gain, driven in part by strong products supporting our Week of Greatness marketing campaign. The Week of Greatness was so great, in fact, it now extends more than a week and we have successfully exported it to the other Foot Locker banners around the globe. \r\nOur November performance was followed by a high single-digit gain in December and another low double-digit gain in January. Although, I'll say more about 2015 towards the end of our remarks, I'll mention now that we continue to have solid top line momentum, having posted a mid-single digit comparable sales gain in February 2015 as well.\r\nMoving down the P&L to gross margin. We produced a 40 basis point improvement to 32.9% of sales from 32.5%. As has been the case all year, the primary driver was leveraging our relatively fixed occupancy and buyer salary expenses in which we benefited 60 basis points. Largely by lowering our markdown rates, we offset ongoing initial markup pressure and produced a slight improvement in merchandise margin on a constant currency basis while also maintaining our inventory aging standards. However, between FX and some other small margin elements such as shipping, overall gross margin netted to a 40 basis point gain. \r\nOur team did an excellent job managing expenses in the quarter as our selling, general and administrative expense rate decreased to 19.6% of sales from 20.4% of sales last year. For the full year, our SG&A expense rate improved by 50 basis points from 20.4% to 19.9%, the first time we have ever had an expense rate below 20%. \r\nThe biggest factor in our full year SG&A performance was the increased productivity of our store associates. We have invested in systems and training to ensure we have the right associates on the sales floor at the right time and that they are well prepared to provide excellent service to our customers. As a result, we experienced improvements across the company in sales-per-payroll hour while maintaining a strong in-store service level. Depreciation expense decreased this quarter to $33 million from $36 million, partly due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. On a constant currency basis, we expect depreciation to increase again next year as we sustain a strong level of investment in our stores, digital capabilities and system technologies. \r\nOur capital expenditures reached just over $200 million in 2014 on an accrual basis, slightly below our most recent guidance. FX played a role here, too, as spending in Europe translated into fewer U.S. dollars, but the larger factor was the timing of certain technology projects such as the new order management system for our digital business, which has been extended into 2015.\r\nOur earnings before interest and taxes reached a rate of 11.4% of sales, better than our long-range goal of 11%. \r\nOur fourth quarter tax rate was 34.8%, below our expected run rate of 36.5% due largely to the expiration of statutes of limitations on foreign tax positions the company had taken in prior years. Last year's rate of 33% was particularly low due to the effective tax planning initiatives that received a boost from the favorable ruling on a foreign tax position during the quarter.\r\nTaken all together, it was another record quarter and another record year. Net income in the quarter of $144 million, an even $1 per share, was 18% higher than last year and represented the first time in our history that we produced 2 separate quarters of at least $1 per share in earnings, having also earned $1.11 in the first quarter. \r\nThe net impact of FX on earnings in the quarter was, as forecasted on our previous call, about $0.02 per share. The effect on the bottom line would have been $0.03, but we had a onetime financial hedge in place to minimize the effect of the stronger dollar. \r\nFor the full year, net income was $522 million, a 21% increase. Our net income margin was 7.3% in 2014, making it the third of our long-range goals that we have surpassed along with EBIT margin and a 15% return on invested capital. Clearly, it was an outstanding performance by the entire team at Foot Locker that enabled us to achieve these significant milestones. \r\nFull year EPS was $3.58 compared to $2.87 last year. The 25% improvement was 4% higher than the increase in net income, reflecting the significant return of cash to shareholders we executed throughout the year via our share repurchase program. \r\nFor the quarter, we repurchased a total of 2.34 million shares for approximately $131 million, bringing our full year total to 5.9 million shares at a cost of $305 million. \r\nWe also returned $127 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends during 2014, which brought our total return to shareholders for the year to $432 million, more than 80% of net income. \r\nAs we announced in February, our board both increased our quarterly dividend payout rate to $0.25 per share and authorizing a new $1 billion share repurchase program. These initiatives demonstrate that we have enhanced returns to shareholders as our underlying business momentum has continued to build. \r\nBefore I hand it over to Dick to go over the merchandise highlights, let me touch on inventory. At actual FX rates, inventory increased $30 million or 2.5%, less than half of our 6.7% sales increase. Using constant currencies, inventory was up 6.6%, a little higher than our standard when compared to our 10.2% comparable sales gain. However, we deliberately brought in a significant amount of inventory early before year-end to ensure that we avoided any major West Coast port delay issues and were well positioned, particularly for NBA All-Stars events. That inventory strategy helped support the solid sales gain in February I mentioned before.\r\nLet me now turn the call over to Dick.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Wow, what a great list of accomplishments that you just ran through, and for every high-level achievement that you mentioned, there were so many smaller individual and team wins that contributed to our success. I can't thank the team at Foot Locker, Inc. enough for all of their efforts. Record-breaking results such as we delivered in 2014 could not have been produced without excellent leadership, teamwork and customer service across every part of our company.\r\nWe've now reached 20 consecutive quarters of significant sales and profit growth, and as Lauren mentioned, we're off to a good start in quarter 21. The excitement around the NBA All-Star game has given our business a nice boost to begin the year.\r\nI should call out here the diligent work of our logistics team. They partnered very effectively with our vendors to ensure a minimum of delivery delays both in Q4 and then the lead up to the All-Star game last month related to the West Coast port slowdown. Yes, there was some impact and it will take some time to get fully back on schedule, but we do not expect the backlog to have a material impact on our business, either in Q1 or the full year.\r\nLet's take a look now at the key drivers of our performance in our fourth quarter. From a family of business perspective, footwear was once again the leader with comparable sales gain in the teens while apparel was down low single digits. Basketball and running footwear were both up double digits with strong gains in both categories in all major regions. \r\nStarting with basketball. Well, I know this is the same story you've heard me tell all year, but brand Jordan was very strong across all of our banners and geographies. The Retro business continued to build momentum, the Sportswear collection performed very well and the Jordan Player shoes also saw increases. \r\nSignature basketball was also very strong in the quarter. Particularly encouraging was the emergence of Kyrie Irving with Nike whose new signature shoes sold very well, at the same time that the shoes of the more established Nike players, LeBron, Kobe and KD, also continued performed at a high level. The ClutchFit shoe from Under Armour had solid results in the fourth quarter, and we're excited about the early performance of the Steph Curry signature shoe so far in Q1. With Lillard, Rose and Walt, adidas also has a promising position in signature basketball. \r\nAs I believe we have continually demonstrated, strength in one category does not preclude strength in another. And as strong as basketball was in the quarter, running was even stronger. The gains were driven by lifestyle running silhouettes including the Roshe, Huarache and various elements of the Max Air platform from Nike. Other brands are performing well, too, in particular, adidas with its popular ZX Flux shoe, PUMA, New Balance and ASICS also are developing encouraging lifestyle running footwear offerings. \r\nSpeaking of lifestyle, the shift towards boots as a fashion item led by Timberland and Nike contributed significantly to strong Q4 results in casual footwear. \r\nAs I mentioned briefly before, apparel was more challenging for us as it has been all year. We had good results in several banners, but the 2 banners with the highest apparel penetration, Champs Sports and Foot Locker Europe, still faced significant challenges. In the U.S., apparel at Foot Locker was up just shy of double digits while Footaction apparel sales were up in the teens. Our ongoing banner differentiation efforts have positioned these 2 banners well to attract their unique customers with the Foot Locker customer preferring a performance-inspired look while Footaction customer is squarely in the lifestyle camp. \r\nThe team at Footaction has done an excellent job in mixing lifestyle items from the major athletic brands, alongside more niche brands such as Asphalt Yacht Club, American Stitch and Fairplay. That said, margins in apparel continue to trail footwear, so we have a lot of opportunity to get even stronger in this part of our business. \r\nLady Foot Locker also had an excellent apparel gain, well into the double digits with a higher margin rate as well. We are successfully transitioning our women's apparel mix to reflect a more premium offering from our key vendor partners such as Nike, Under Armour and adidas. It is still work in progress, but we feel very well aligned with our vendors on the shared strategy of emphasizing and growing the women's athletic apparel business. \r\nOn the flip side, apparel sales decreased double digits in Foot Locker Europe where the down trends in certain branded lifestyle programs as well as private label continue to challenge us. While sales were down, the European business does retain some of the highest apparel margins in the company. \r\nApparel sales were down mid-single digits at Champs Sports. There were some bright spots, led by fleece tops and bottoms, which performed very well at good margins. However, these could not offset the continued decline in licensed apparel and some of the same lifestyle programs that challenged Foot Locker Europe. We continue to work with our vendor partners to develop new or updated styles that we believe will begin to rebuild the apparel businesses at both Champs Sports and Foot Locker Europe in 2015.\r\nTurning to real estate. We ended the year with 3,423 owned stores, a decrease of 51 from the end of the third quarter and 50 from the beginning of the year. The decrease is larger than the 25 stores we mentioned on the third quarter call as we had the opportunity to close several more underperforming stores than previously anticipated, the majority of which were Lady Foot Locker doors. Despite the decreased store count, gross square footage ended the year slightly higher than a year ago. The stores we are opening tend to be larger than the stores we are closing. We also typically require extra space when we add our various vendor shop-in-shops in remodeled stores. These real estate projects continue to produce positive results for our business, hence, our announcement last month of our $220 million capital spending program for 2015. \r\nBetween these exciting fresh store environments and powerful marketing programs, we were successful in driving an increase in traffic during the quarter. We continue to see higher average selling prices with footwear units increasing as well. All in all, it was a very strong year for Foot Locker. \r\nLauren mentioned 3 of our long-range goals that we have already reached: ROIC, EBIT margin and net income margin. We have made good progress towards our other key objectives: sales, sales per square foot and inventory turns. \r\nOver the past few years, we have developed into a high-performance company that has reached record heights in financial and operational success. The teamwork, innovation, and passion that I see in our people have been incredible. I want to again thank the entire team of associates for their outstanding accomplishments.\r\nLooking ahead, we intend to seize our opportunities to once again raise the bar and achieve our next set of financial milestones, which the senior management team and I look forward to sharing with you on the 16th of this month in New York.\r\nFor now, let me turn the call back over to Lauren to give you some specific guidance in 2015.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Dick. We have, indeed, built a good deal of momentum in our business overall and we do not see that fundamentally changing in the near term. We have opportunities to grow the base business this year, domestically and internationally. On the other hand, the stronger dollar is expected to be a significant headwind to our reported results in 2015. \r\nThat said, I'm happy to be in a position to repeat the high-level guidance for 2015 that we've given in recent years. We believe we can deliver a mid-single-digit comparable sales gain and a double-digit percentage earnings per share increase this year. However, the strong U.S. dollar means that a double-digit increase in 2015 will be more tempered than the 20-plus percent gains of recent years. If exchange rates stay around where they are now, our 2015 EPS results will be $0.16 to $0.18 lower than they would have been at 2014 exchange rates.\r\nThe remainder of my remarks on FX will also assume that exchange rates stay close to where they are now with the euro around $1.10 and the Canadian and Australian dollars around $0.80. \r\nFor sales, we expect the weaker foreign currencies will mean that our mid-single-digit comparable sales gain would translate into a low single-digit total sales increase. For merchandise margin, the offsetting dynamics of lower initial markups and lower markdowns will likely continue in 2015. \r\nOn a constant currency basis, we believe we can achieve slightly higher merchandise margins, but the fact that our international divisions have a higher gross margin rate than our domestic divisions means that our overall rate will be pressured down due to FX. Although we should continue to lever our fixed buying and occupancy costs, the net impact of all these factors is that we expect gross margin to be flat to up slightly in 2015. \r\nOn the other hand, we believe SG&A expense will benefit from the weaker exchange rate. While international divisions have higher-than-average gross margins, they also have higher SG&A expenses. At a mid-single-digit comp for the company overall, we should expect to achieve an SG&A rate improvement of 50 to 60 basis points. Depreciation and amortization expense benefited from some onetime adjustments in 2014 to land at $139 million. With our $220 million capital expenditure program approved for 2015, we expect depreciation expense to increase to a range of $150 million to $155 million. \r\nIn the capital program for this year, we plan to open just over 100 stores and close about 80. The new stores will be concentrated in Kids, Europe and SIX:02. We'll provide more detail on store opening plans on the 16th. In the meantime, we believe we can continue to improve the productivity of our existing square footage through the investments we are making in our store fleet. \r\nWe are planning interest expense to be fairly flat to this year's $5 million and we are continuing to plan our effective tax rate at 36.5% in 2015. Our guidance of a double-digit percentage increase in earnings per share also assumes a lower share count based on the continued execution of our new $1 billion share repurchase program. \r\nThere are no really big variances by quarter to the guidance I just gave you. We are planning mid-single-digit comp gains in each quarter. That said, the FX impact on sales margin and SG&A are naturally greater in quarters with lower sales volume, thus the second quarter, which saw the euro still pushing $1.40 last year, will be especially difficult to achieve a double-digit EPS increase this year. Our current expectation is a mid-single-digit percentage EPS increase in Q2. Of course, difficult FX comparisons ease as we get into the back half of 2015 and especially Q4. \r\nI think that covers the highlights of 2015, so I'll end there and ask Brandon to open up the call to your questions.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: John Maurer (Executives)】\nThank you, Brandon, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to Foot Locker, Inc.'s Fourth Quarter and 2014 Full Year Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for joining us today.\r\nAs noted in this morning's press release, we reported GAAP net income of $146 million in the fourth quarter, 21% more than the $121 million that the company earned in the fourth quarter last year. On a per share basis, we earned $1.01 this year on a GAAP basis compared to $0.81 in the same period a year ago, a 25% increase.\r\nFor the full year, we topped $0.5 billion in net income for the first time in our history as an athletic company, reaching a total of $520 million. This represents a 21% increase over the $429 million that the company earned in 2013. Earnings per share improved to 25% to $3.56 from $2.85 per share.\r\nAs noted in our release, we had a onetime gain from the sale of a property as well as a write-down of a trademark. Excluding these items, fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was an even $1, a 22% increase over the $0.82 a share we earned on a non-GAAP basis last year.\r\nA reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in our press release, and except as otherwise indicated, the numbers mentioned during our remarks this morning will be based on the non-GAAP results.\r\nWith me this morning are Dick Johnson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \r\nLauren will lead off our call with a detailed look at our fourth quarter financial performance, followed by Dick, who will provide insight into some of the merchandising industry trends that led to our strong results. Lauren will wrap up our prepared remarks with an overview of our annual and quarterly expectations for 2015. \r\nAs we announced last month, we will be hosting an investor meeting here in our New York headquarters on March 16 at 2 p.m. during which we will describe our long-term strategic priorities for growth and update our financial goals. Therefore, during today's question-and-answer period, we ask that you focus your questions on our fourth quarter results and near-term outlook for 2015.\r\nLauren?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nThank you, John, and good morning to you all. We really appreciate you joining us this morning as we review our 2014 results and take a first look at 2015.\r\nWhat better place to start in describing our strong fourth quarter results than with our comparable sales gain of 10.2%. This is an enormous credit to our merchants and operations team that we were able to drive such positive, and as you'll hear, broad-based and consistent results. The direct-to-customer segment led the way, as it has all year, with a 21.9% sales gain for the quarter. Within the segment, our Eastbay banner was up low double digits while our U.S. store banner dot-com businesses were collectively up over 30%. For the year, our direct business had a comparable sales gain of 17.8% with Eastbay up mid-single digits while store banner dot-com sales were up almost 40%.\r\nThe stores segment posted a strong 8.5% comparable sales gain for the quarter. Several U.S. banners produced double-digit gains led by Footaction and Foot Locker with increases in the teens followed by low double-digit gains in Kids Foot Locker, and yes, Lady Foot Locker. The gain at Lady Foot Locker was its third consecutive quarterly increase and its first double-digit gain in several years. To quote Ken's reaction, \"Oorah!\"\r\nChamps Sports was up mid-single digits as were European businesses. Elsewhere internationally, Foot Locker Asia/Pacific was up low double digits while Foot Locker Canada was up high single digits. \r\nSo very strong comparable sales gains across the board by channel, geography and gender. Our 10.2% comparable sales gain, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was partially offset by FX and other factors to bring our total sales gain to a still very healthy 6.7% in the quarter. Almost all of the 350 basis point difference between our comp gain and the total sales increase was attributable to the stronger U.S. dollar in Q4 this year compared to last year with the lack of CCS sales this year and a net 50 store count reduction by the end of the quarter, smaller contributing factors.\r\nOur monthly comp cadence was steady through the quarter. We finished November with a low double-digit comp gain, driven in part by strong products supporting our Week of Greatness marketing campaign. The Week of Greatness was so great, in fact, it now extends more than a week and we have successfully exported it to the other Foot Locker banners around the globe. \r\nOur November performance was followed by a high single-digit gain in December and another low double-digit gain in January. Although, I'll say more about 2015 towards the end of our remarks, I'll mention now that we continue to have solid top line momentum, having posted a mid-single digit comparable sales gain in February 2015 as well.\r\nMoving down the P&L to gross margin. We produced a 40 basis point improvement to 32.9% of sales from 32.5%. As has been the case all year, the primary driver was leveraging our relatively fixed occupancy and buyer salary expenses in which we benefited 60 basis points. Largely by lowering our markdown rates, we offset ongoing initial markup pressure and produced a slight improvement in merchandise margin on a constant currency basis while also maintaining our inventory aging standards. However, between FX and some other small margin elements such as shipping, overall gross margin netted to a 40 basis point gain. \r\nOur team did an excellent job managing expenses in the quarter as our selling, general and administrative expense rate decreased to 19.6% of sales from 20.4% of sales last year. For the full year, our SG&A expense rate improved by 50 basis points from 20.4% to 19.9%, the first time we have ever had an expense rate below 20%. \r\nThe biggest factor in our full year SG&A performance was the increased productivity of our store associates. We have invested in systems and training to ensure we have the right associates on the sales floor at the right time and that they are well prepared to provide excellent service to our customers. As a result, we experienced improvements across the company in sales-per-payroll hour while maintaining a strong in-store service level. Depreciation expense decreased this quarter to $33 million from $36 million, partly due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. On a constant currency basis, we expect depreciation to increase again next year as we sustain a strong level of investment in our stores, digital capabilities and system technologies. \r\nOur capital expenditures reached just over $200 million in 2014 on an accrual basis, slightly below our most recent guidance. FX played a role here, too, as spending in Europe translated into fewer U.S. dollars, but the larger factor was the timing of certain technology projects such as the new order management system for our digital business, which has been extended into 2015.\r\nOur earnings before interest and taxes reached a rate of 11.4% of sales, better than our long-range goal of 11%. \r\nOur fourth quarter tax rate was 34.8%, below our expected run rate of 36.5% due largely to the expiration of statutes of limitations on foreign tax positions the company had taken in prior years. Last year's rate of 33% was particularly low due to the effective tax planning initiatives that received a boost from the favorable ruling on a foreign tax position during the quarter.\r\nTaken all together, it was another record quarter and another record year. Net income in the quarter of $144 million, an even $1 per share, was 18% higher than last year and represented the first time in our history that we produced 2 separate quarters of at least $1 per share in earnings, having also earned $1.11 in the first quarter. \r\nThe net impact of FX on earnings in the quarter was, as forecasted on our previous call, about $0.02 per share. The effect on the bottom line would have been $0.03, but we had a onetime financial hedge in place to minimize the effect of the stronger dollar. \r\nFor the full year, net income was $522 million, a 21% increase. Our net income margin was 7.3% in 2014, making it the third of our long-range goals that we have surpassed along with EBIT margin and a 15% return on invested capital. Clearly, it was an outstanding performance by the entire team at Foot Locker that enabled us to achieve these significant milestones. \r\nFull year EPS was $3.58 compared to $2.87 last year. The 25% improvement was 4% higher than the increase in net income, reflecting the significant return of cash to shareholders we executed throughout the year via our share repurchase program. \r\nFor the quarter, we repurchased a total of 2.34 million shares for approximately $131 million, bringing our full year total to 5.9 million shares at a cost of $305 million. \r\nWe also returned $127 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends during 2014, which brought our total return to shareholders for the year to $432 million, more than 80% of net income. \r\nAs we announced in February, our board both increased our quarterly dividend payout rate to $0.25 per share and authorizing a new $1 billion share repurchase program. These initiatives demonstrate that we have enhanced returns to shareholders as our underlying business momentum has continued to build. \r\nBefore I hand it over to Dick to go over the merchandise highlights, let me touch on inventory. At actual FX rates, inventory increased $30 million or 2.5%, less than half of our 6.7% sales increase. Using constant currencies, inventory was up 6.6%, a little higher than our standard when compared to our 10.2% comparable sales gain. However, we deliberately brought in a significant amount of inventory early before year-end to ensure that we avoided any major West Coast port delay issues and were well positioned, particularly for NBA All-Stars events. That inventory strategy helped support the solid sales gain in February I mentioned before.\r\nLet me now turn the call over to Dick.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nThanks, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Wow, what a great list of accomplishments that you just ran through, and for every high-level achievement that you mentioned, there were so many smaller individual and team wins that contributed to our success. I can't thank the team at Foot Locker, Inc. enough for all of their efforts. Record-breaking results such as we delivered in 2014 could not have been produced without excellent leadership, teamwork and customer service across every part of our company.\r\nWe've now reached 20 consecutive quarters of significant sales and profit growth, and as Lauren mentioned, we're off to a good start in quarter 21. The excitement around the NBA All-Star game has given our business a nice boost to begin the year.\r\nI should call out here the diligent work of our logistics team. They partnered very effectively with our vendors to ensure a minimum of delivery delays both in Q4 and then the lead up to the All-Star game last month related to the West Coast port slowdown. Yes, there was some impact and it will take some time to get fully back on schedule, but we do not expect the backlog to have a material impact on our business, either in Q1 or the full year.\r\nLet's take a look now at the key drivers of our performance in our fourth quarter. From a family of business perspective, footwear was once again the leader with comparable sales gain in the teens while apparel was down low single digits. Basketball and running footwear were both up double digits with strong gains in both categories in all major regions. \r\nStarting with basketball. Well, I know this is the same story you've heard me tell all year, but brand Jordan was very strong across all of our banners and geographies. The Retro business continued to build momentum, the Sportswear collection performed very well and the Jordan Player shoes also saw increases. \r\nSignature basketball was also very strong in the quarter. Particularly encouraging was the emergence of Kyrie Irving with Nike whose new signature shoes sold very well, at the same time that the shoes of the more established Nike players, LeBron, Kobe and KD, also continued performed at a high level. The ClutchFit shoe from Under Armour had solid results in the fourth quarter, and we're excited about the early performance of the Steph Curry signature shoe so far in Q1. With Lillard, Rose and Walt, adidas also has a promising position in signature basketball. \r\nAs I believe we have continually demonstrated, strength in one category does not preclude strength in another. And as strong as basketball was in the quarter, running was even stronger. The gains were driven by lifestyle running silhouettes including the Roshe, Huarache and various elements of the Max Air platform from Nike. Other brands are performing well, too, in particular, adidas with its popular ZX Flux shoe, PUMA, New Balance and ASICS also are developing encouraging lifestyle running footwear offerings. \r\nSpeaking of lifestyle, the shift towards boots as a fashion item led by Timberland and Nike contributed significantly to strong Q4 results in casual footwear. \r\nAs I mentioned briefly before, apparel was more challenging for us as it has been all year. We had good results in several banners, but the 2 banners with the highest apparel penetration, Champs Sports and Foot Locker Europe, still faced significant challenges. In the U.S., apparel at Foot Locker was up just shy of double digits while Footaction apparel sales were up in the teens. Our ongoing banner differentiation efforts have positioned these 2 banners well to attract their unique customers with the Foot Locker customer preferring a performance-inspired look while Footaction customer is squarely in the lifestyle camp. \r\nThe team at Footaction has done an excellent job in mixing lifestyle items from the major athletic brands, alongside more niche brands such as Asphalt Yacht Club, American Stitch and Fairplay. That said, margins in apparel continue to trail footwear, so we have a lot of opportunity to get even stronger in this part of our business. \r\nLady Foot Locker also had an excellent apparel gain, well into the double digits with a higher margin rate as well. We are successfully transitioning our women's apparel mix to reflect a more premium offering from our key vendor partners such as Nike, Under Armour and adidas. It is still work in progress, but we feel very well aligned with our vendors on the shared strategy of emphasizing and growing the women's athletic apparel business. \r\nOn the flip side, apparel sales decreased double digits in Foot Locker Europe where the down trends in certain branded lifestyle programs as well as private label continue to challenge us. While sales were down, the European business does retain some of the highest apparel margins in the company. \r\nApparel sales were down mid-single digits at Champs Sports. There were some bright spots, led by fleece tops and bottoms, which performed very well at good margins. However, these could not offset the continued decline in licensed apparel and some of the same lifestyle programs that challenged Foot Locker Europe. We continue to work with our vendor partners to develop new or updated styles that we believe will begin to rebuild the apparel businesses at both Champs Sports and Foot Locker Europe in 2015.\r\nTurning to real estate. We ended the year with 3,423 owned stores, a decrease of 51 from the end of the third quarter and 50 from the beginning of the year. The decrease is larger than the 25 stores we mentioned on the third quarter call as we had the opportunity to close several more underperforming stores than previously anticipated, the majority of which were Lady Foot Locker doors. Despite the decreased store count, gross square footage ended the year slightly higher than a year ago. The stores we are opening tend to be larger than the stores we are closing. We also typically require extra space when we add our various vendor shop-in-shops in remodeled stores. These real estate projects continue to produce positive results for our business, hence, our announcement last month of our $220 million capital spending program for 2015. \r\nBetween these exciting fresh store environments and powerful marketing programs, we were successful in driving an increase in traffic during the quarter. We continue to see higher average selling prices with footwear units increasing as well. All in all, it was a very strong year for Foot Locker. \r\nLauren mentioned 3 of our long-range goals that we have already reached: ROIC, EBIT margin and net income margin. We have made good progress towards our other key objectives: sales, sales per square foot and inventory turns. \r\nOver the past few years, we have developed into a high-performance company that has reached record heights in financial and operational success. The teamwork, innovation, and passion that I see in our people have been incredible. I want to again thank the entire team of associates for their outstanding accomplishments.\r\nLooking ahead, we intend to seize our opportunities to once again raise the bar and achieve our next set of financial milestones, which the senior management team and I look forward to sharing with you on the 16th of this month in New York.\r\nFor now, let me turn the call back over to Lauren to give you some specific guidance in 2015.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nThanks, Dick. We have, indeed, built a good deal of momentum in our business overall and we do not see that fundamentally changing in the near term. We have opportunities to grow the base business this year, domestically and internationally. On the other hand, the stronger dollar is expected to be a significant headwind to our reported results in 2015. \r\nThat said, I'm happy to be in a position to repeat the high-level guidance for 2015 that we've given in recent years. We believe we can deliver a mid-single-digit comparable sales gain and a double-digit percentage earnings per share increase this year. However, the strong U.S. dollar means that a double-digit increase in 2015 will be more tempered than the 20-plus percent gains of recent years. If exchange rates stay around where they are now, our 2015 EPS results will be $0.16 to $0.18 lower than they would have been at 2014 exchange rates.\r\nThe remainder of my remarks on FX will also assume that exchange rates stay close to where they are now with the euro around $1.10 and the Canadian and Australian dollars around $0.80. \r\nFor sales, we expect the weaker foreign currencies will mean that our mid-single-digit comparable sales gain would translate into a low single-digit total sales increase. For merchandise margin, the offsetting dynamics of lower initial markups and lower markdowns will likely continue in 2015. \r\nOn a constant currency basis, we believe we can achieve slightly higher merchandise margins, but the fact that our international divisions have a higher gross margin rate than our domestic divisions means that our overall rate will be pressured down due to FX. Although we should continue to lever our fixed buying and occupancy costs, the net impact of all these factors is that we expect gross margin to be flat to up slightly in 2015. \r\nOn the other hand, we believe SG&A expense will benefit from the weaker exchange rate. While international divisions have higher-than-average gross margins, they also have higher SG&A expenses. At a mid-single-digit comp for the company overall, we should expect to achieve an SG&A rate improvement of 50 to 60 basis points. Depreciation and amortization expense benefited from some onetime adjustments in 2014 to land at $139 million. With our $220 million capital expenditure program approved for 2015, we expect depreciation expense to increase to a range of $150 million to $155 million. \r\nIn the capital program for this year, we plan to open just over 100 stores and close about 80. The new stores will be concentrated in Kids, Europe and SIX:02. We'll provide more detail on store opening plans on the 16th. In the meantime, we believe we can continue to improve the productivity of our existing square footage through the investments we are making in our store fleet. \r\nWe are planning interest expense to be fairly flat to this year's $5 million and we are continuing to plan our effective tax rate at 36.5% in 2015. Our guidance of a double-digit percentage increase in earnings per share also assumes a lower share count based on the continued execution of our new $1 billion share repurchase program. \r\nThere are no really big variances by quarter to the guidance I just gave you. We are planning mid-single-digit comp gains in each quarter. That said, the FX impact on sales margin and SG&A are naturally greater in quarters with lower sales volume, thus the second quarter, which saw the euro still pushing $1.40 last year, will be especially difficult to achieve a double-digit EPS increase this year. Our current expectation is a mid-single-digit percentage EPS increase in Q2. Of course, difficult FX comparisons ease as we get into the back half of 2015 and especially Q4. \r\nI think that covers the highlights of 2015, so I'll end there and ask Brandon to open up the call to your questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "This is Corinna Van de Ghinst on for Kate. I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit more about the promotional environment that you saw across the competitive landscape in Q4 and how that might have impacted your business during the quarter. And then just as a follow-up to your comments on the inventory buildup ahead of the port disruption, you mentioned that you're not expecting a material impact on your results, but how do you think the port disruptions might be impacting the selling environment across the industry in the first half?\n\n---\n\nYes, from a promotional point of view, this is Dick, from a promotional point of view, our focus is really selling premium footwear and apparel. So we know what our cadence is. As Lauren talked about, our markdowns were lower, so going into the holiday period our promotional cadence was where it needed to be to manage our inventory and to drive sales. So we finished up with our inventory on standards -- better than standards and with the markdowns down. So we worry about what we have to do from a selling point of view. The cadence around the industry, we monitor, we know what goes on. But again, the kids are coming for us for innovation, exciting new products and they're willing to pay for those. As far as the inventory buildup and the port delay, again our team did a tremendous job of getting out in front of it, so that we were well positioned going into Q4. We gave a little bit of relief on our ending inventory numbers, as Lauren talked about, to make sure that we were positioned going into February and we continue to monitor it. Obviously, there's catch-up going on. As we talked about, they'll be awhile while where everything gets reset, but we feel good about where we sit in the industry.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then just as a quick follow-up, do you have any guidance on how many shop-in-shop rollouts you're planning to do this year across the Fly Zone, Kicks Lounge, Jordan 23, et cetera?\n\n---\n\nYes, we'll go into a lot more detail on that when we talk on the 16th, but those would be part of remodel programs and new store openings. And our remods will be at a level fairly consistent with what we experienced in -- what we accomplished in 2014.\n\n---\n\nSo can you talk a little bit about -- and I apologize if I missed this, can you talk about what ASP was versus traffic in the fourth quarter? And then maybe just how that dynamic looks directionally as we think about 2015?\n\n---\n\nASPs continued strong as they have been all year. Traffic was up slightly in the quarter. Very strong traffic in international divisions. In the U.S., it was a bit more mixed with some divisions up slightly and some divisions down slightly.\n\n---\n\nAnd directionally in 2015, Lauren?\n\n---\n\nWell, I wouldn't see ASP's direction to change and traffic we continue to drive in excess at the mall, we believe, because very strong product offering, great marketing efforts and that's the reason why we're making sure that we keep those store environments so fresh and exciting because that helps with the traffic.\n\n---\n\nAnd our vendors continue to bring innovative and fresh product and the customers clearly are responding positively to that. So I agree with Lauren, I think ASPs will continue to be where they're at or up slightly.\n\n---\n\nSo I guess the -- where I was going with that is that you guys -- we're thinking ahead on the gross margin for next year here a little bit and I know you guys tested some new allocation software last year and you commented that, that would further help merchandise margins with improved markdown rates, but you also just commented on ongoing item new pressure. You've had a lot of pricing power here that's been helping on ASPs and the products obviously resonating. I'm curious how far we should look ahead to IMU continuing to be a pressure, considering the consumer seems to be accepting these price increases.\n\n---\n\nAgain, the IMU that we saw this year, that pressure was really driven by mix of vendor offering and mix of category, so it wasn't about the price we paid for the product. I would see IMU tempering somewhat, that delta year-over-year, but we still think that's a factor. So we control what we can control. We work very closely with the vendors to improve product flow that help with the margins, and as you pointed out, we're in the midst of the installation of the allocation system, which will help us get that much smarter at getting the right product to the right place, therefore supporting lower markdowns, more full priced selling.\n\n---\n\nAnd using more cross-channel initiatives as well. So our inventory is visible to all of our customers, regardless of where they're shopping, which gives the inventory, at the end, more value and allows us to use fewer markdowns?\n\n---\n\nAnd when we really are at the top of our game in apparel, that should help as well. But we've got, what we described, we think that on a constant currency basis, merchandise margins improved slightly in '15. We levered the fix, but we've got to navigate the FX, which, when you factor that in, it means we're going to be flat to up slightly when it's all finished.\n\n---\n\nIf I could go to DTC, just continued strength particularly in the banners. Maybe just a bit of an update there in terms of where you feel like that channel has evolved, what still needs to be done in terms of sort of infrastructure build-outs to support and any just sort of updated thoughts around the consumer migration that you all see.\n\n---\n\nWell, I'll start with the consumer. Eric, we see a multichannel consumer worth more than a single channel, for instance. So while we drive excitement in the stores, we also have great programs online that attract the consumer. We want them to be able to shop our stores and our banners wherever they are, whenever they are. So we've been in the digital or dot-com Internet business for a long, long time, so the infrastructure has been in place. We continue to make improvements. Lauren mentioned an order management system that we'll put in place starting in 2015 just to make it a little bit more effective on the back end and make it a little more streamlined for the customer on the front end. But we continue to make investments both in the stores and the digital space to make it more clear for the customer that wherever they are, whenever they want to shop they have access to our banners and to our product.\n\n---\n\nAnd then as you think about it, just a follow-up on that in terms of the vendors, Nike coming out with their sneaker app and again, just that balance of working with the vendors to segment the product across the space, any sort of issues, challenges as this channel evolves?\n\n---\n\nNo, I think that we have a great relationship with our vendors. The strength that we bring to the table that our consumer can see the best of all the vendors. We're able to create meaningful assortments across vendor brands. And I think that we're going to both coexist in the space, obviously. But our marketing programs drive consumers to our sites, the product attracts them to our sites and our stores and I think that it will continue to drive success in the multichannel environment.\n\n---\n\nAnd then just lastly, if I could, as it relates to Europe. Sort of on a constant currency basis, so beyond FX, the assumptions being made for '15, it sounds like traffic is holding up pretty well, but maybe just speak to the underlying demand within Europe that you guys see.\n\n---\n\nWe continue to see the recovery -- the economic recovery is a little bit bumpy in Europe, different -- north and south, different country-to-country, but we're in 19 different countries and the sneaker culture continues to be strong. The running silhouette is king there, but the team over in Europe is doing a great job of making basketball relevant to that consumer. Our vendor partners are strong in Europe as well. Ken has called out in previous calls that the 2 real emerging markets from a sales perspective are the U.S. and Western Europe. So we're positioned well. We continue to invest there, Lauren talked about the store openings being driven there. And the team over there is also doing a nice job with their digital efforts. So we feel good about where we're at in Europe.\n\n---\n\nSo I guess, first, just on apparel. I guess fourth quarter better than maybe the trend line we've seen throughout the year, but there's still some work to do. So I guess your thoughts about where the opportunity is, maybe where the issue is, private label versus branded. What can you do really to kind of start to see some improving trend line given the drag it's been across the business. And I'm just curious, in Champs remodeled stores, was there a dramatic difference versus those Champs stores that were not remodeled on apparel?\n\n---\n\nWe see a difference in the remodeled stores, absolutely. And I think that we talked about it in the comments earlier, Chris, that in Europe, it's a little bit of a case of some branded assortment items that have not resonated as well with the consumer, along with some private label hiccups. At Champs, there are some branded issues with a couple of programs and then the private -- or the license side of the business. And Champs is on a pretty steady decline. So it's a matter of getting those things balanced, working with the brands to make sure that we've got strong assortments. Part of the remodeled program is to do a better job of storytelling from head to toe and across the brands, so the remodels, a small percentage. We're not done with the remodel program by any stretch of the imagination. So I think the work that we've seen done at Foot Locker and the things that they've done at Footaction tell us that there are some upsides and the work that the team at Lady Foot Locker and SIX:02 is doing on the apparel front tell us that we can get there. It's just that the 2 banners that have the highest penetration, Champs and Foot Locker Europe, have struggled a bit.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So I don't know if you'll break this out, but just in your assumption of your mid-single-digit comp on the year, you're not really assuming the apparel business turns, I assume? You're still a negative number?\n\n---\n\nWe don't break out that guidance by product category, but rest assured, we're working very hard on apparel.\n\n---\n\nOkay, fair enough. Just last 2 things here. One, just on the remodels for Foot Locker and Champs, any -- I think you're at 30% on Champs, 20% on Foot Locker, any thoughts about what that looks like this year? You continue to remodel those, any percentages? And Lady SIX:02, are you at a point now where you can more aggressively roll that out? Or is that something you'll touch more on, on the 16th?\n\n---\n\nYes, well, we'll talk -- we'll have some more about SIX:02 and our women's business in totality on the 16th. But the status of the remods, we ended the year with Foot Locker at about 20% through its remod and Champs about 25 and we're at about the same remod level in '15 and '14, which is what the plan is. They would both end up, Foot Locker and Champs, in the low 30% completion at the end of '15 on remods.\n\n---\n\nI just wanted some clarification. You said that you expect in reported numbers the D&A to be $150 million, is that correct? Or you get -- you should get -- can you just clarify that for me?\n\n---\n\nYes. We should be about $150 million to $155 million in reported next year.\n\n---\n\nAnd then even with that, you're expecting reported -- you're expecting your reported currency-affected earnings to be up double digits as well, correct?\n\n---\n\nYes. But as I described, the double digits is, because of FX, more tempered than what we've been achieving in the last few years, which has been double digit, then 20-something increase. We're expecting something more tempered than that because we've got FX pressure of about $0.16 to $0.18. Does that help?\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then as far as the product mix goes and where you are with the allocation, where are you, Dick, with the allocation system and the implementation there? And where are you with the implementation of the allocation system right now? And when do you think -- when do you expect that to be completely in place?\n\n---\n\nWell, Phase 1 of the implementation is ongoing across the U.S. divisions. Europe was our leader in that and has most of their divisions up and they'll be 100% onboard with the allocation system later this quarter. The U.S. will trail that a bit, but will also be -- by the midpoint of the year, will have all of their departments on the allocation system and that will be Phase 1. Phase 2 will be piloted in Q4.\n\n---\n\nAnd we really don't -- we don't really ramp up until 2016 before we get to the last division, the last product category.\n\n---\n\nSo then, just to understand it. You should steadily get some benefit from this as it rolls in, but arguably, as it gains its own history and does all the stuff, next year will be -- this year will be good, next year will be better and '17 would be full effect is the right way to think about that?\n\n---\n\nWell, you're absolutely right that we continue to get benefit for multiple periods because, as you described, it is a learning system. The more it learns, the better. There are also humans running it, so the more we learn, the better. But as we have opportunity then to apply those learnings to our purchases, right, we have -- we purchase many months in advance, we'll start to apply those learnings to the purchases and we'll get benefit. So yes, it's a multi-year build.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then lastly, what is the share count that you're assuming -- the average share count for the full year that you're assuming in the guidance?\n\n---\n\nI'm not going to go that far. But as we said, we just with executing the share repurchase program, the new $1 billion program, we expect average share count to decline in the year.\n\n---\n\nWould you expect it to decline more than it did last year on a percentage basis?\n\n---\n\nI can't do that for you.\n\n---\n\nIt'll depend on multiple factors.\n\n---\n\nJust a couple of quick ones, one is just a follow-up on the Michael Binetti's ASP question. Can you give us color on the -- was the ASPs strength in the fourth quarter, was it across basketball and running? Was it sort of a similar type of average selling price? Or was one way ahead of the other?\n\n---\n\nWe saw increases across our footwear categories, Robby.\n\n---\n\nSo were they -- was basketball a lot stronger than running? Or was running ASPs up similarly to basketball?\n\n---\n\nThey were both up.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then the technical running business, so I think you called out the casual running business, but any commentary on the health of the technical running business? The Free and the Lunar and I think you mentioned ASICS getting into casual running, but how about their technical running business, how is the outlook for that in 2015?\n\n---\n\nIt varies banner by banner for us, of course, Robby. I mean I think when you look at Brooks and ASICS and some of the platforms that you mentioned from Nike on our women's business, there's still strength. We've got a certain number of doors that have good programs with all of those technical shoes in our Foot Locker banner both in the U.S. and in Europe, so we think that technical -- we think that the running silhouette continues to gain strength. Whether the shoes are technical or lifestyle, most of them don't get running [ph] anyway. So the point is that the vendors continue to bring great looks in the silhouette that has meaning for our consumer.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then last question. I know you guys saw the Walmart and TJX announcements about wages. Can you remind us where Foot Locker is in wages? And if we should expect any changes or pressures given what's going on across retail.\n\n---\n\nYes. So our compensation for our store associates is base plus commission. So they have the ability through their sales strength to set their compensation. As a result, the majority of our associates are significantly more than minimum wage. So we watch those developments very closely because we are committed to paying competitive wages. But our associates, certainly compensation dollar-wise is important to them, but there are also other things that they enjoy about working at Foot Locker, not the least of which is being in stores surrounded by sneakers, which they have a personal passion for. So the discount that they get on that product is also important to them. But I would say, we continue to watch that very closely and we'll remain competitive.\n\n---\n\nI'm wondering about eBay (sic) [Eastbay] posting a pretty nice gain. Is there something going on there that's invigorating that business?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think that as they manage -- as our team out in Wausau manages our store dot-com banner and the Eastbay banner, there are puts and takes sometimes, Bernie, but they've done a really good job of communicating with that high school athlete, which is really their target. They've got great relationships with our vendor partners. They published a really nice look in adidas catalog and a really nice look in Jordan catalog. They continue to use the catalog, the Eastbay catalog, as marketing tool. I just think that the consumer really responded to some of their marketing efforts in Q4.\n\n---\n\nAnd could you flesh out a little bit the reasons to success at Footaction?\n\n---\n\nI think the footwear sort of speaks for itself. They've got a great assortment of footwear that really attracts the consumer, but the thing that we really called out, Bernie, was their really good work around apparel where they've been able to take key lifestyle silhouettes from our major athletic vendors and blend them in with some of the faster fashion sort of vendors that consumer that really shops Footaction is after: Asphalt Yacht Club, American Stitch, et cetera. They've got the ability to move a little bit quicker in adjusting to some of those styles, so I think that they finally have a nice rhythm as it relates to that mix. And obviously, when you talk about things like Timberland boots becoming a fashion item, Footaction certainly benefits from that sort of mixture.\n\n---\n\nGreat. Sounds like you have a lot of good things going on and I'm sure we'll hear more about Lady plans on the 16th.\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely.\n\n---\n\nI wanted to follow-up on the Lady business and the double-digit comps that you're seeing there. Is there a way to quantify if there's a benefit you're seeing from some of the store closings that you've done there? Or is there a benefit from maybe opening some bigger stores? I'm trying to dig in a little bit more on to that level -- that low double-digit comp that you're seeing and what's driving that improvement.\n\n---\n\nWell, it's a combination of a lot of things, right? I think the merchandise assortment is improved. They've done a nice job positioning apparel even in the smaller Lady Foot Locker stores. They've shifted that consumer over a little bit in that base. Clearly, Lauren called out that we closed some underperforming stores, so that will continue to benefit us. The footwear mix is strong and obviously we've got the 15 SIX:02 doors that factor into that mix as well, which are, in fact, a bit bigger stores, Seth.\n\n---\n\nIs there a way to think about how big of a delta there was between your better-performing Lady Foot Locker stores and then some of the ones that you closed?\n\n---\n\nWe haven't really gotten into discussing how good the good are and how bad the bad are, so it blended out to a double-digit comp gain for the quarter.\n\n---\n\nGot you, okay. And then as we think about capital allocation, it's been great to see the increase in buyback. There's been a little bit of an evolution in the thought process, it seems like. How do you think about the right ratio or the right level of repurchase on an annual basis? I know you gave a 3-year view with the authorization, but what's the right way to think about the annual target there?\n\n---\n\nIt's not a formula. We take into consideration what our capital plans are, we described those as $220 million for next year. We factor in other uses for the cash. And between that and the dividend, we're making sure that we've got really meaningful returns to the shareholders. So I hope that helps you.\n\n---\n\nAs John said earlier, the amount of repurchases is driven by a lot of factors and Lauren just called out many of them. So we don't have an annual target.\n\n---\n\nOkay, understood. And then just one more and I'll hop off. But in terms of store growth, it looks like you're going to be a net opener in 2015, first time in a while. I know we'll get a lot more color in a couple of weeks, but I'm just wondering, are you accelerating the openings of some of the banners? Or you're just closing less of others? How should we be thinking about that at this point?\n\n---\n\nWell, we called out in the comments, Seth, that the openings are going to be around Kids in Europe and then in SIX:02. So I think that our goal is always to close fewer, quite honestly. We'd prefer to get them more productive and keep them open, but when we have opportunistic chances to close stores, we'll take those opportunities if it makes sense. So I think that, regardless of net opener or not, our square footage continues to increase based on some of the shop-in-shops that we talked about. And the productivity of our square footage continues to increase, which is really what drives the business.\n\n---\n\nI wonder if you guys could dig in to the Runners Point Group a little more. At this point, what have you learned about that consumer? How does it affect your thinking about the growth opportunity there? And then as a second point, how is their online business helping you guys to think about your own dot-com business in Europe?\n\n---\n\nWell, from a Runners Point perspective, from a group perspective, we're working on the consumer segmentation work that we've talked about in the past. We've got the Runners Point stores now really defined as all things running, from lifestyle to performance. So they've got men's and women's, the assortments are there, the high-touch selling is there, the treadmills are there to really create that running destination in the mall and the high streets of Germany right now. Once we get that model proven and completed, we'll be ready to test that model outside of Germany. The work's not quite as far along with the Sidestep banner, that's a more lifestyle-driven banner. So as we look to position Sidestep, Foot Locker and Runners Point in the same mall or the same high street in Europe, we've got a little work to do around profiling the Sidestep assortment in the way that the store looks and figuring out exactly who their muse [ph] customer is and making sure that we speak to that consumer. So I think we're making good progress. Clearly, the Runners Point is ahead from a segmentation point of view at this point. From a dot-com perspective, the Tredex business that's part of the Runners Point Group is helping inform the Foot Locker Europe team and we've got our center of dot-com business, our center of excellence in Wausau, so we're trying to share global best practices between the team that's over in Europe and the team that's in Wausau and we continue to see progress being made there as well.\n\n---\n\nSo there's been a lot of debate lately about the athletic cycle, what inning we're in. I'm just curious what you guys are seeing in terms of lead indicators, product pipeline. And you talked about customer demand for the more premium priced shoes, but just in general, how do -- what's the best way to think about not just here, but also abroad, the athletic cycle in the pipeline?\n\n---\n\nYes, we continue to see good product in the pipeline. I think, Matthew, the vendors continue to bring innovation whether it be technical innovation, whether it be fabrications, colors, new platforms that they're operating on. So we continue to see a pretty robust pipeline of product across the categories and around the geographies. And I think that it's somewhat of an athletic cycle, but it's also a casualization cycle where people are very comfortable wearing sneakers these days. And I get a lot of stares on the train when I've got my suit on with my sneakers, but it doesn't bother me at all and our core consumers certainly are very comfortable wearing sneakers. So there's ebbs and flows across categories that I expect we'll continue to see, but I feel good about where the athletic trend is and certainly where the pipeline is.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then on the margin side, can you just talk about where the European margins stand today versus maybe prior peak and more so how to think about the opportunity on a go-forward basis?\n\n---\n\nThe merchandise margins is your question or finished margins?\n\n---\n\nAs much detail as you're willing to provide.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Well, let's talk about it in terms of finished margins, which my comment around that would be we have done just so much on productivity, really across the geographies that margins, no matter what part of the globe you're in, are strong. But historically, our international margins, finished, that benefited from the fact it's just less promotional in many of the European markets with legislated promotional periods. So Europe countries, recovering from trough periods, and as Dick described, that's been a little uneven. So as that comes back, opportunity to further increase those finished margins internationally. And the initiative that we're working on, they apply across the geographies, doesn't matter which we're talking about. So the allocation systems and the time and attendance systems, scheduling systems that we put in, all of those are global initiatives.\n\n---\n\nThere's already been a lot of focus on AUR on this call and I'll just try to ask in a bit of a different way. You all are seeing sneaker strength beyond the very highly priced premium Jordan and LeBron product, you mentioned boots and other casual and running silhouettes, some of the younger hoopers like Steph and Kyrie are also seeing success. Are you concerned at all that there will be a share shift towards some of these lower priced, relatively lower-priced products, that could have a negative impact to your overall comp? Or is the unit volume from these assortments enough to make up for it?\n\n---\n\nSo we know that our kids are going to go to wherever the coolest shoes are, right? I mean, we certainly trade, as you called out, up at the higher end with the Jordan or the LeBron and some of those key sneakers. But a lot of the business is also built on the LeBron Soldier, for example, which is not up at that high price point. That's more on the Kyrie and the Steph Curry sort of price range. So I think we've got strength, Paul, across the range of price points and we see kids buying the Roshes, which are great casual sneakers. They may have 2 or 3 pairs because of the colors that are there and what they want to hook up with. The same with the ZX Flux from Adi, not a high-end basketball sort of price point, but certainly we do volume because the shoe is so flexible for the kid to wear in multiple iterations. So I think we continue to see a good, strong mix of price points.\n\n---\n\nAnd I think we worked very hard to make sure that we have a strong offering across the price points.\n\n---\n\nThat's helpful. Appreciate that. And then just touching on margins, obviously there's a lot of noise regarding FX this year, but just in general taking a step back, how should we think about the comp thresholds to leverage fixed occupancy and expenses on a go-forward basis? Has that changed at all as we look back over the past year or 2?\n\n---\n\nNo, we still are able to lever at low single digits. Part of that is making sure that you really plan your expenses tight and in line with sales and you will react to ups and downs. And I think as we demonstrated it last year with where we finished with our margins and our SG&A rate, we have a finely developed muscle there.\n\n---\n\nQuestions about the basketball trend. Under Armour has made a lot of improvement in basketball recently, and when that happens, do you see the overall interest level from a consumer standpoint increase? Or do you think one brand's benefit really just comes at the expense of another brand?\n\n---\n\nI think that we end up expanding the market in totality, Jay. I think that there's kids that are comfortable with the Under Armour brand, there are kids that will try the Under Armour brand because of some of the things that they're doing. But I think that in the end, we end up expanding the market a bit. It's a new price point, it's a new vendor, there is new excitement around the Curry shoe. Obviously, having him win the 3-point shootout in his new shoe didn't hurt us starting this quarter out around the All-Star game. So I don't necessarily think it's a share shift. I think that we end up growing the market a bit.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then just on that All-Star game, can you just talk about how you were able to leverage that event and turn into a big sales driver?\n\n---\n\nWell, the All-Star game's important for us every year, I mean regardless of where it's played. I mean, obviously with us being in New York and the league being here in New York, there's a lot of excitement around it. So I think that one of the differences this year was the fact that it was held in 2 locations, so we've seen many markets where the All-Star game has brought the town, the city to a virtual halt. Well New York, of course, is so big that it can absorb all of that. But it's a good boost to the start of our year regardless of where the All-Star game is held. It's ultimately driven by great product.\n\n---\n\nGreat product and we have some exciting things going on in special shop.\n\n---\n\nJust one question here. Looking out to '15 and thinking about the mid-single-digit comp there, you've had 5 years of mid- to high single-digit comps, outstanding performance. Can you help us prioritize the building blocks that will drive another mid-single-digit comp this year? Whether it's categories, remodels, e-comm, international, any sort of prioritization and maybe quantification will be greatly appreciated.\n\n---\n\nWell, Camilo, I think that we've got the ability to walk and chew gum with all of those categories, so I think that there's strength across our banners; there's strength across our categories; there's strength across our channels and there's strength across our geographies. So we obviously have internal plans that we work off of, but I think our guys, our teams are all driven to find success. Retail is sort of a perpetual gain. It's not like we can't repeat. It's more difficult than some of the team sports to repeat, but our team certainly believes that they can repeat and I don't think it makes any difference what banner they represent, what channel they represent or what geography they represent. So I think there's a nice strength across our business.\n\n---\n\nAll of those levers that you enumerated, all of those levers are what make us excited about the future and give us confidence. And we'll be talking a lot more about that excitement on the 16th.\n\n---\n\nNo change in demand profile for any other categories nor the opportunities continue to drive sell-through for that?\n\n---\n\nWell, our categories always ebb and flow, Camilo. I mean, our buyers and our merchant teams do a great job of identifying hot categories and shifting ultimate buy dollars to be in the right place, and we work closely with our vendor partners to have a view of the future. But we don't get into where we see categories going up and down dramatically. So I just think that we have strength across all the pillars that you mentioned and that really, to Lauren's point, is what has us excited about '15 and certainly beyond.\n\n---\n\nAll right. So thanks again for participating on today's call. We hope to see many of you here on the 16th. And please join us on our next earnings call, which we anticipate will take place at 9 a.m. on Friday, May 22, following the release of our first quarter results earlier that morning. Thanks again, and good bye.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Corinna Van der Ghinst (Analysts)】\nThis is Corinna Van de Ghinst on for Kate. I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit more about the promotional environment that you saw across the competitive landscape in Q4 and how that might have impacted your business during the quarter. And then just as a follow-up to your comments on the inventory buildup ahead of the port disruption, you mentioned that you're not expecting a material impact on your results, but how do you think the port disruptions might be impacting the selling environment across the industry in the first half?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nYes, from a promotional point of view, this is Dick, from a promotional point of view, our focus is really selling premium footwear and apparel. So we know what our cadence is. As Lauren talked about, our markdowns were lower, so going into the holiday period our promotional cadence was where it needed to be to manage our inventory and to drive sales. So we finished up with our inventory on standards -- better than standards and with the markdowns down. So we worry about what we have to do from a selling point of view. The cadence around the industry, we monitor, we know what goes on. But again, the kids are coming for us for innovation, exciting new products and they're willing to pay for those. As far as the inventory buildup and the port delay, again our team did a tremendous job of getting out in front of it, so that we were well positioned going into Q4. We gave a little bit of relief on our ending inventory numbers, as Lauren talked about, to make sure that we were positioned going into February and we continue to monitor it. Obviously, there's catch-up going on. As we talked about, they'll be awhile while where everything gets reset, but we feel good about where we sit in the industry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Corinna Van der Ghinst (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then just as a quick follow-up, do you have any guidance on how many shop-in-shop rollouts you're planning to do this year across the Fly Zone, Kicks Lounge, Jordan 23, et cetera?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nYes, we'll go into a lot more detail on that when we talk on the 16th, but those would be part of remodel programs and new store openings. And our remods will be at a level fairly consistent with what we experienced in -- what we accomplished in 2014.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Binetti (Analysts)】\nSo can you talk a little bit about -- and I apologize if I missed this, can you talk about what ASP was versus traffic in the fourth quarter? And then maybe just how that dynamic looks directionally as we think about 2015?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nASPs continued strong as they have been all year. Traffic was up slightly in the quarter. Very strong traffic in international divisions. In the U.S., it was a bit more mixed with some divisions up slightly and some divisions down slightly.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Binetti (Analysts)】\nAnd directionally in 2015, Lauren?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nWell, I wouldn't see ASP's direction to change and traffic we continue to drive in excess at the mall, we believe, because very strong product offering, great marketing efforts and that's the reason why we're making sure that we keep those store environments so fresh and exciting because that helps with the traffic.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nAnd our vendors continue to bring innovative and fresh product and the customers clearly are responding positively to that. So I agree with Lauren, I think ASPs will continue to be where they're at or up slightly.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Binetti (Analysts)】\nSo I guess the -- where I was going with that is that you guys -- we're thinking ahead on the gross margin for next year here a little bit and I know you guys tested some new allocation software last year and you commented that, that would further help merchandise margins with improved markdown rates, but you also just commented on ongoing item new pressure. You've had a lot of pricing power here that's been helping on ASPs and the products obviously resonating. I'm curious how far we should look ahead to IMU continuing to be a pressure, considering the consumer seems to be accepting these price increases.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nAgain, the IMU that we saw this year, that pressure was really driven by mix of vendor offering and mix of category, so it wasn't about the price we paid for the product. I would see IMU tempering somewhat, that delta year-over-year, but we still think that's a factor. So we control what we can control. We work very closely with the vendors to improve product flow that help with the margins, and as you pointed out, we're in the midst of the installation of the allocation system, which will help us get that much smarter at getting the right product to the right place, therefore supporting lower markdowns, more full priced selling.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nAnd using more cross-channel initiatives as well. So our inventory is visible to all of our customers, regardless of where they're shopping, which gives the inventory, at the end, more value and allows us to use fewer markdowns?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nAnd when we really are at the top of our game in apparel, that should help as well. But we've got, what we described, we think that on a constant currency basis, merchandise margins improved slightly in '15. We levered the fix, but we've got to navigate the FX, which, when you factor that in, it means we're going to be flat to up slightly when it's all finished.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Tracy (Analysts)】\nIf I could go to DTC, just continued strength particularly in the banners. Maybe just a bit of an update there in terms of where you feel like that channel has evolved, what still needs to be done in terms of sort of infrastructure build-outs to support and any just sort of updated thoughts around the consumer migration that you all see.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nWell, I'll start with the consumer. Eric, we see a multichannel consumer worth more than a single channel, for instance. So while we drive excitement in the stores, we also have great programs online that attract the consumer. We want them to be able to shop our stores and our banners wherever they are, whenever they are. So we've been in the digital or dot-com Internet business for a long, long time, so the infrastructure has been in place. We continue to make improvements. Lauren mentioned an order management system that we'll put in place starting in 2015 just to make it a little bit more effective on the back end and make it a little more streamlined for the customer on the front end. But we continue to make investments both in the stores and the digital space to make it more clear for the customer that wherever they are, whenever they want to shop they have access to our banners and to our product.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Tracy (Analysts)】\nAnd then as you think about it, just a follow-up on that in terms of the vendors, Nike coming out with their sneaker app and again, just that balance of working with the vendors to segment the product across the space, any sort of issues, challenges as this channel evolves?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nNo, I think that we have a great relationship with our vendors. The strength that we bring to the table that our consumer can see the best of all the vendors. We're able to create meaningful assortments across vendor brands. And I think that we're going to both coexist in the space, obviously. But our marketing programs drive consumers to our sites, the product attracts them to our sites and our stores and I think that it will continue to drive success in the multichannel environment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Eric Tracy (Analysts)】\nAnd then just lastly, if I could, as it relates to Europe. Sort of on a constant currency basis, so beyond FX, the assumptions being made for '15, it sounds like traffic is holding up pretty well, but maybe just speak to the underlying demand within Europe that you guys see.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nWe continue to see the recovery -- the economic recovery is a little bit bumpy in Europe, different -- north and south, different country-to-country, but we're in 19 different countries and the sneaker culture continues to be strong. The running silhouette is king there, but the team over in Europe is doing a great job of making basketball relevant to that consumer. Our vendor partners are strong in Europe as well. Ken has called out in previous calls that the 2 real emerging markets from a sales perspective are the U.S. and Western Europe. So we're positioned well. We continue to invest there, Lauren talked about the store openings being driven there. And the team over there is also doing a nice job with their digital efforts. So we feel good about where we're at in Europe.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Svezia (Analysts)】\nSo I guess, first, just on apparel. I guess fourth quarter better than maybe the trend line we've seen throughout the year, but there's still some work to do. So I guess your thoughts about where the opportunity is, maybe where the issue is, private label versus branded. What can you do really to kind of start to see some improving trend line given the drag it's been across the business. And I'm just curious, in Champs remodeled stores, was there a dramatic difference versus those Champs stores that were not remodeled on apparel?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nWe see a difference in the remodeled stores, absolutely. And I think that we talked about it in the comments earlier, Chris, that in Europe, it's a little bit of a case of some branded assortment items that have not resonated as well with the consumer, along with some private label hiccups. At Champs, there are some branded issues with a couple of programs and then the private -- or the license side of the business. And Champs is on a pretty steady decline. So it's a matter of getting those things balanced, working with the brands to make sure that we've got strong assortments. Part of the remodeled program is to do a better job of storytelling from head to toe and across the brands, so the remodels, a small percentage. We're not done with the remodel program by any stretch of the imagination. So I think the work that we've seen done at Foot Locker and the things that they've done at Footaction tell us that there are some upsides and the work that the team at Lady Foot Locker and SIX:02 is doing on the apparel front tell us that we can get there. It's just that the 2 banners that have the highest penetration, Champs and Foot Locker Europe, have struggled a bit.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Svezia (Analysts)】\nOkay. So I don't know if you'll break this out, but just in your assumption of your mid-single-digit comp on the year, you're not really assuming the apparel business turns, I assume? You're still a negative number?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nWe don't break out that guidance by product category, but rest assured, we're working very hard on apparel.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christopher Svezia (Analysts)】\nOkay, fair enough. Just last 2 things here. One, just on the remodels for Foot Locker and Champs, any -- I think you're at 30% on Champs, 20% on Foot Locker, any thoughts about what that looks like this year? You continue to remodel those, any percentages? And Lady SIX:02, are you at a point now where you can more aggressively roll that out? Or is that something you'll touch more on, on the 16th?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nYes, well, we'll talk -- we'll have some more about SIX:02 and our women's business in totality on the 16th. But the status of the remods, we ended the year with Foot Locker at about 20% through its remod and Champs about 25 and we're at about the same remod level in '15 and '14, which is what the plan is. They would both end up, Foot Locker and Champs, in the low 30% completion at the end of '15 on remods.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sam Poser (Analysts)】\nI just wanted some clarification. You said that you expect in reported numbers the D&A to be $150 million, is that correct? Or you get -- you should get -- can you just clarify that for me?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nYes. We should be about $150 million to $155 million in reported next year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sam Poser (Analysts)】\nAnd then even with that, you're expecting reported -- you're expecting your reported currency-affected earnings to be up double digits as well, correct?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nYes. But as I described, the double digits is, because of FX, more tempered than what we've been achieving in the last few years, which has been double digit, then 20-something increase. We're expecting something more tempered than that because we've got FX pressure of about $0.16 to $0.18. Does that help?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sam Poser (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then as far as the product mix goes and where you are with the allocation, where are you, Dick, with the allocation system and the implementation there? And where are you with the implementation of the allocation system right now? And when do you think -- when do you expect that to be completely in place?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nWell, Phase 1 of the implementation is ongoing across the U.S. divisions. Europe was our leader in that and has most of their divisions up and they'll be 100% onboard with the allocation system later this quarter. The U.S. will trail that a bit, but will also be -- by the midpoint of the year, will have all of their departments on the allocation system and that will be Phase 1. Phase 2 will be piloted in Q4.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nAnd we really don't -- we don't really ramp up until 2016 before we get to the last division, the last product category.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sam Poser (Analysts)】\nSo then, just to understand it. You should steadily get some benefit from this as it rolls in, but arguably, as it gains its own history and does all the stuff, next year will be -- this year will be good, next year will be better and '17 would be full effect is the right way to think about that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nWell, you're absolutely right that we continue to get benefit for multiple periods because, as you described, it is a learning system. The more it learns, the better. There are also humans running it, so the more we learn, the better. But as we have opportunity then to apply those learnings to our purchases, right, we have -- we purchase many months in advance, we'll start to apply those learnings to the purchases and we'll get benefit. So yes, it's a multi-year build.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sam Poser (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then lastly, what is the share count that you're assuming -- the average share count for the full year that you're assuming in the guidance?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nI'm not going to go that far. But as we said, we just with executing the share repurchase program, the new $1 billion program, we expect average share count to decline in the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sam Poser (Analysts)】\nWould you expect it to decline more than it did last year on a percentage basis?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nI can't do that for you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Maurer (Executives)】\nIt'll depend on multiple factors.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nJust a couple of quick ones, one is just a follow-up on the Michael Binetti's ASP question. Can you give us color on the -- was the ASPs strength in the fourth quarter, was it across basketball and running? Was it sort of a similar type of average selling price? Or was one way ahead of the other?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nWe saw increases across our footwear categories, Robby.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nSo were they -- was basketball a lot stronger than running? Or was running ASPs up similarly to basketball?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nThey were both up.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then the technical running business, so I think you called out the casual running business, but any commentary on the health of the technical running business? The Free and the Lunar and I think you mentioned ASICS getting into casual running, but how about their technical running business, how is the outlook for that in 2015?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nIt varies banner by banner for us, of course, Robby. I mean I think when you look at Brooks and ASICS and some of the platforms that you mentioned from Nike on our women's business, there's still strength. We've got a certain number of doors that have good programs with all of those technical shoes in our Foot Locker banner both in the U.S. and in Europe, so we think that technical -- we think that the running silhouette continues to gain strength. Whether the shoes are technical or lifestyle, most of them don't get running [ph] anyway. So the point is that the vendors continue to bring great looks in the silhouette that has meaning for our consumer.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Robert Ohmes (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then last question. I know you guys saw the Walmart and TJX announcements about wages. Can you remind us where Foot Locker is in wages? And if we should expect any changes or pressures given what's going on across retail.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nYes. So our compensation for our store associates is base plus commission. So they have the ability through their sales strength to set their compensation. As a result, the majority of our associates are significantly more than minimum wage. So we watch those developments very closely because we are committed to paying competitive wages. But our associates, certainly compensation dollar-wise is important to them, but there are also other things that they enjoy about working at Foot Locker, not the least of which is being in stores surrounded by sneakers, which they have a personal passion for. So the discount that they get on that product is also important to them. But I would say, we continue to watch that very closely and we'll remain competitive.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bernard Sosnick (Analysts)】\nI'm wondering about eBay (sic) [Eastbay] posting a pretty nice gain. Is there something going on there that's invigorating that business?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nWell, I think that as they manage -- as our team out in Wausau manages our store dot-com banner and the Eastbay banner, there are puts and takes sometimes, Bernie, but they've done a really good job of communicating with that high school athlete, which is really their target. They've got great relationships with our vendor partners. They published a really nice look in adidas catalog and a really nice look in Jordan catalog. They continue to use the catalog, the Eastbay catalog, as marketing tool. I just think that the consumer really responded to some of their marketing efforts in Q4.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bernard Sosnick (Analysts)】\nAnd could you flesh out a little bit the reasons to success at Footaction?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nI think the footwear sort of speaks for itself. They've got a great assortment of footwear that really attracts the consumer, but the thing that we really called out, Bernie, was their really good work around apparel where they've been able to take key lifestyle silhouettes from our major athletic vendors and blend them in with some of the faster fashion sort of vendors that consumer that really shops Footaction is after: Asphalt Yacht Club, American Stitch, et cetera. They've got the ability to move a little bit quicker in adjusting to some of those styles, so I think that they finally have a nice rhythm as it relates to that mix. And obviously, when you talk about things like Timberland boots becoming a fashion item, Footaction certainly benefits from that sort of mixture.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Bernard Sosnick (Analysts)】\nGreat. Sounds like you have a lot of good things going on and I'm sure we'll hear more about Lady plans on the 16th.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nAbsolutely.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Seth Sigman (Analysts)】\nI wanted to follow-up on the Lady business and the double-digit comps that you're seeing there. Is there a way to quantify if there's a benefit you're seeing from some of the store closings that you've done there? Or is there a benefit from maybe opening some bigger stores? I'm trying to dig in a little bit more on to that level -- that low double-digit comp that you're seeing and what's driving that improvement.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nWell, it's a combination of a lot of things, right? I think the merchandise assortment is improved. They've done a nice job positioning apparel even in the smaller Lady Foot Locker stores. They've shifted that consumer over a little bit in that base. Clearly, Lauren called out that we closed some underperforming stores, so that will continue to benefit us. The footwear mix is strong and obviously we've got the 15 SIX:02 doors that factor into that mix as well, which are, in fact, a bit bigger stores, Seth.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Seth Sigman (Analysts)】\nIs there a way to think about how big of a delta there was between your better-performing Lady Foot Locker stores and then some of the ones that you closed?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nWe haven't really gotten into discussing how good the good are and how bad the bad are, so it blended out to a double-digit comp gain for the quarter.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Seth Sigman (Analysts)】\nGot you, okay. And then as we think about capital allocation, it's been great to see the increase in buyback. There's been a little bit of an evolution in the thought process, it seems like. How do you think about the right ratio or the right level of repurchase on an annual basis? I know you gave a 3-year view with the authorization, but what's the right way to think about the annual target there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nIt's not a formula. We take into consideration what our capital plans are, we described those as $220 million for next year. We factor in other uses for the cash. And between that and the dividend, we're making sure that we've got really meaningful returns to the shareholders. So I hope that helps you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nAs John said earlier, the amount of repurchases is driven by a lot of factors and Lauren just called out many of them. So we don't have an annual target.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Seth Sigman (Analysts)】\nOkay, understood. And then just one more and I'll hop off. But in terms of store growth, it looks like you're going to be a net opener in 2015, first time in a while. I know we'll get a lot more color in a couple of weeks, but I'm just wondering, are you accelerating the openings of some of the banners? Or you're just closing less of others? How should we be thinking about that at this point?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nWell, we called out in the comments, Seth, that the openings are going to be around Kids in Europe and then in SIX:02. So I think that our goal is always to close fewer, quite honestly. We'd prefer to get them more productive and keep them open, but when we have opportunistic chances to close stores, we'll take those opportunities if it makes sense. So I think that, regardless of net opener or not, our square footage continues to increase based on some of the shop-in-shops that we talked about. And the productivity of our square footage continues to increase, which is really what drives the business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edward Plank (Analysts)】\nI wonder if you guys could dig in to the Runners Point Group a little more. At this point, what have you learned about that consumer? How does it affect your thinking about the growth opportunity there? And then as a second point, how is their online business helping you guys to think about your own dot-com business in Europe?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nWell, from a Runners Point perspective, from a group perspective, we're working on the consumer segmentation work that we've talked about in the past. We've got the Runners Point stores now really defined as all things running, from lifestyle to performance. So they've got men's and women's, the assortments are there, the high-touch selling is there, the treadmills are there to really create that running destination in the mall and the high streets of Germany right now. Once we get that model proven and completed, we'll be ready to test that model outside of Germany. The work's not quite as far along with the Sidestep banner, that's a more lifestyle-driven banner. So as we look to position Sidestep, Foot Locker and Runners Point in the same mall or the same high street in Europe, we've got a little work to do around profiling the Sidestep assortment in the way that the store looks and figuring out exactly who their muse [ph] customer is and making sure that we speak to that consumer. So I think we're making good progress. Clearly, the Runners Point is ahead from a segmentation point of view at this point. From a dot-com perspective, the Tredex business that's part of the Runners Point Group is helping inform the Foot Locker Europe team and we've got our center of dot-com business, our center of excellence in Wausau, so we're trying to share global best practices between the team that's over in Europe and the team that's in Wausau and we continue to see progress being made there as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Boss (Analysts)】\nSo there's been a lot of debate lately about the athletic cycle, what inning we're in. I'm just curious what you guys are seeing in terms of lead indicators, product pipeline. And you talked about customer demand for the more premium priced shoes, but just in general, how do -- what's the best way to think about not just here, but also abroad, the athletic cycle in the pipeline?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nYes, we continue to see good product in the pipeline. I think, Matthew, the vendors continue to bring innovation whether it be technical innovation, whether it be fabrications, colors, new platforms that they're operating on. So we continue to see a pretty robust pipeline of product across the categories and around the geographies. And I think that it's somewhat of an athletic cycle, but it's also a casualization cycle where people are very comfortable wearing sneakers these days. And I get a lot of stares on the train when I've got my suit on with my sneakers, but it doesn't bother me at all and our core consumers certainly are very comfortable wearing sneakers. So there's ebbs and flows across categories that I expect we'll continue to see, but I feel good about where the athletic trend is and certainly where the pipeline is.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Boss (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then on the margin side, can you just talk about where the European margins stand today versus maybe prior peak and more so how to think about the opportunity on a go-forward basis?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nThe merchandise margins is your question or finished margins?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Boss (Analysts)】\nAs much detail as you're willing to provide.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nOkay. Well, let's talk about it in terms of finished margins, which my comment around that would be we have done just so much on productivity, really across the geographies that margins, no matter what part of the globe you're in, are strong. But historically, our international margins, finished, that benefited from the fact it's just less promotional in many of the European markets with legislated promotional periods. So Europe countries, recovering from trough periods, and as Dick described, that's been a little uneven. So as that comes back, opportunity to further increase those finished margins internationally. And the initiative that we're working on, they apply across the geographies, doesn't matter which we're talking about. So the allocation systems and the time and attendance systems, scheduling systems that we put in, all of those are global initiatives.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nThere's already been a lot of focus on AUR on this call and I'll just try to ask in a bit of a different way. You all are seeing sneaker strength beyond the very highly priced premium Jordan and LeBron product, you mentioned boots and other casual and running silhouettes, some of the younger hoopers like Steph and Kyrie are also seeing success. Are you concerned at all that there will be a share shift towards some of these lower priced, relatively lower-priced products, that could have a negative impact to your overall comp? Or is the unit volume from these assortments enough to make up for it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nSo we know that our kids are going to go to wherever the coolest shoes are, right? I mean, we certainly trade, as you called out, up at the higher end with the Jordan or the LeBron and some of those key sneakers. But a lot of the business is also built on the LeBron Soldier, for example, which is not up at that high price point. That's more on the Kyrie and the Steph Curry sort of price range. So I think we've got strength, Paul, across the range of price points and we see kids buying the Roshes, which are great casual sneakers. They may have 2 or 3 pairs because of the colors that are there and what they want to hook up with. The same with the ZX Flux from Adi, not a high-end basketball sort of price point, but certainly we do volume because the shoe is so flexible for the kid to wear in multiple iterations. So I think we continue to see a good, strong mix of price points.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nAnd I think we worked very hard to make sure that we have a strong offering across the price points.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nThat's helpful. Appreciate that. And then just touching on margins, obviously there's a lot of noise regarding FX this year, but just in general taking a step back, how should we think about the comp thresholds to leverage fixed occupancy and expenses on a go-forward basis? Has that changed at all as we look back over the past year or 2?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nNo, we still are able to lever at low single digits. Part of that is making sure that you really plan your expenses tight and in line with sales and you will react to ups and downs. And I think as we demonstrated it last year with where we finished with our margins and our SG&A rate, we have a finely developed muscle there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jay Sole (Analysts)】\nQuestions about the basketball trend. Under Armour has made a lot of improvement in basketball recently, and when that happens, do you see the overall interest level from a consumer standpoint increase? Or do you think one brand's benefit really just comes at the expense of another brand?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nI think that we end up expanding the market in totality, Jay. I think that there's kids that are comfortable with the Under Armour brand, there are kids that will try the Under Armour brand because of some of the things that they're doing. But I think that in the end, we end up expanding the market a bit. It's a new price point, it's a new vendor, there is new excitement around the Curry shoe. Obviously, having him win the 3-point shootout in his new shoe didn't hurt us starting this quarter out around the All-Star game. So I don't necessarily think it's a share shift. I think that we end up growing the market a bit.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jay Sole (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then just on that All-Star game, can you just talk about how you were able to leverage that event and turn into a big sales driver?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nWell, the All-Star game's important for us every year, I mean regardless of where it's played. I mean, obviously with us being in New York and the league being here in New York, there's a lot of excitement around it. So I think that one of the differences this year was the fact that it was held in 2 locations, so we've seen many markets where the All-Star game has brought the town, the city to a virtual halt. Well New York, of course, is so big that it can absorb all of that. But it's a good boost to the start of our year regardless of where the All-Star game is held. It's ultimately driven by great product.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nGreat product and we have some exciting things going on in special shop.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Camilo Lyon (Analysts)】\nJust one question here. Looking out to '15 and thinking about the mid-single-digit comp there, you've had 5 years of mid- to high single-digit comps, outstanding performance. Can you help us prioritize the building blocks that will drive another mid-single-digit comp this year? Whether it's categories, remodels, e-comm, international, any sort of prioritization and maybe quantification will be greatly appreciated.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nWell, Camilo, I think that we've got the ability to walk and chew gum with all of those categories, so I think that there's strength across our banners; there's strength across our categories; there's strength across our channels and there's strength across our geographies. So we obviously have internal plans that we work off of, but I think our guys, our teams are all driven to find success. Retail is sort of a perpetual gain. It's not like we can't repeat. It's more difficult than some of the team sports to repeat, but our team certainly believes that they can repeat and I don't think it makes any difference what banner they represent, what channel they represent or what geography they represent. So I think there's a nice strength across our business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lauren Peters (Executives)】\nAll of those levers that you enumerated, all of those levers are what make us excited about the future and give us confidence. And we'll be talking a lot more about that excitement on the 16th.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Camilo Lyon (Analysts)】\nNo change in demand profile for any other categories nor the opportunities continue to drive sell-through for that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Johnson (Executives)】\nWell, our categories always ebb and flow, Camilo. I mean, our buyers and our merchant teams do a great job of identifying hot categories and shifting ultimate buy dollars to be in the right place, and we work closely with our vendor partners to have a view of the future. But we don't get into where we see categories going up and down dramatically. So I just think that we have strength across all the pillars that you mentioned and that really, to Lauren's point, is what has us excited about '15 and certainly beyond.\n\n---\n\n【回答: John Maurer (Executives)】\nAll right. So thanks again for participating on today's call. We hope to see many of you here on the 16th. And please join us on our next earnings call, which we anticipate will take place at 9 a.m. on Friday, May 22, following the release of our first quarter results earlier that morning. Thanks again, and good bye.",

      "transcript_text1": "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our annual results presentation. I'm going to be very brief this morning because Simon's got quite a fulsome report to make to you all. First of all, I'd just like to say last year was a very good year for us again, remarkably the sixth consecutive year that we've grown our earnings per share by 15% or more, which I think is a very major achievement through a difficult economic time. Sales were up 7%, and we've gone through the GBP 4 billion mark for the first time. More importantly, we've returned GBP 572 million, virtually all our free cash flow, to our shareholders in buybacks or dividends. You'll notice in Simon's report that we've highlighted the total shareholders' return of 19%, which is also pretty good, but we feel that now we're doing special dividends that we ought to look at the total shareholders' return as another measure as well as EPS. So we will continue to track that as we go forward. You are more interested in hearing Simon tell you how we did that and what our prospects are in the year ahead. So I'll pass it onto Simon. Simon?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Chairman. Very flattering of you to suggest they're going to be interested but I'll do my best. It was a good year for NEXT but a very much, to use an old cliché, a year of two halves. At the beginning of the year, we -- at this point last year, we forecasted our profits to be up 8% at GBP 750 million. We then had 2 amazing quarters. Those 2 quarters were really the second and third quarter of a three-quarter run are very good seasons. Rather rationally, we put our forecast at GBP 795 million. And at that time, there were some accusations and we were being overly cautious. And it turned out, third quarter, we issued what I'm not allowed to call a profit's warning -- Alister gets very annoyed -- it was a minor adjustment to our guidance. And we came in at 5% in third quarter, which was very disappointing. I mean, at that point, we forecast 1% up in the fourth quarter. As it turned out, we did slightly better than that, up 3%. Full year profits came in at GBP 782 million boosted significantly by some group profits. And the underlying profits from the brand were up pretty much in line with sales, around 7.7%. Just looking at those 4 quarters, it's important to see what's actually going on underneath the numbers because the fourth quarter looks like the worst. If you compare it to 2 years, that's the 2-year growth in each of those quarters. What you can see is that the fourth quarter, because it hit the overperformance of the year before, actually in 2-year terms was as good as any other quarter. And it's really the third quarter that was the underperformer and that was when we had the period of very warm weather. And I suppose the important point about this chart is that the experience in quarter 4, you can use as a predictor for the experience that we like to have in quarter 1 and quarter 2. \r\nJust going back to the accounts, GBP 782 million is what we made. Total sales were up 7.2%. Total operating profit up 12.3%. You should really look at that at the very most of being 11.1% up because there was GBP 9 million currency gain. This is not a real gain. It's basically an accounting adjustment, accounting profit on instruments that we use to hedge out the following year's purchases. So it is purely an accounting measure but is not a real profit, and we'd expect that to reverse out in the year ahead.\r\nTaxation, the same as last year. Last year, our tax reduced a lot by a tax win. This year, it was reduced a little bit by another tax win. In the year ahead, we expect it to be around about the same, around 20.5% as the tax rate -- corporate tax rate continues to come down, subject to any changes that might be made after May. Profit after tax up 12.5%. Earnings per share up 14.7%. That's being boosted by not only last year's buybacks but the buybacks at the end of the previous year.\r\nMoving on to cash flow. Capital expenditure. Capital expenditure on stores slightly down on last year. The drop is down to spending less on cosmetic refix that we did in the previous year, about GBP 5 million less on cosmetics refix than the previous year. \r\nIn terms of other expenditure around the business, GBP 18 million on new IT building, upgrading some of our product buildings and GBP 2 million spent on the beginnings of replacing all of our till systems. Just in terms -- in case you think we're blowing money on fancy head offices, this is just to give you an insight into the beauteous and wonderful head office that we work in that is, in fact, the old Kendall's building that was our systems department and the money we spent on the IT building is to turn into that. So we bought for the front increased space by 60%. So it is a -- and our head office complex is one that needs a little bit of expenditure and it's a bit out of date. But just to give you a feeling for -- when we used to interview people for the systems team, we used to interview them on a different building from the one that end up working in. I'm sure many banks have similar systems department. Warehousing, GBP 12 million in the year. This is all about automating part of our home warehouse for furniture. Looking forward to the year ahead, we expect slightly more expenditure on new stores, partly because we're in -- we anticipate opening slightly more new space and partly because we anticipate spending a little bit more on cosmetic, about GBP 5 million more on new space, about GBP 5 million more on cosmetic. A further GBP 11 million on head office infrastructure. That's to build a new children's wear department, new -- update our call center and new photographic studio and to finish the systems building and then GBP 5 million on rolling out the new till systems, which that rollout process will begin in about 2 or 3 months' time. \r\nThe big change in CapEx is in warehousing. Here we're going to spend GBP 27 million. This is to fit out a new home warehouse. This will be fully automated storage and retrieval of large palletized items such as flat-pack furniture, made-up furniture and sofas. That is just the cost of the fit out. The cost of the building is being unfitted. That's being paid for by the landlord. So we'll be renting the building. \r\nMoving on to working capital. The swing here is all about the slowdown in the growth of the Directory credit base. Cash returns to shareholders, GBP 572 million. Ordinary dividends, up considerably on last year. A lot of that increase is about the rebalancing of our interim and final dividend because we increased the interim far more than the final and that distorts some increase, GBP 138 million on buybacks, GBP 223 million on special dividends.\r\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Stock up 8%, where levels of stock that we think are about normal. This is not the level of sales growth we're expecting. The main reason for the increase in stock this year was because at the end of last year, because we had a very good fourth quarter, we were beginning to run out of stock. We pull forward lot of the summer stock to sell in the autumn season and we spent the whole of the summer and spring seasons -- we spent with stock levels that were too low. And then we had a very good end-of-season sale. So you should expect part of -- you should expect a bigger end-of-season sale at the end of the summer season this year than last year. \r\nDebt is up 4.5%. This is all being driven by an increase in the Directory debtor book, which is up broadly in line with credit sales. Net debt year end, around the same as last year. Just to remind you of how that was made up, GBP 363 million of operational cash flow, paid out in share buybacks and special dividends. Looking to the year ahead, we're expecting a similar amount of cash inflow. The reason that we're not anticipating an increase is largely because of the change in CapEx. So although we're anticipating that it will increase our profits and, therefore, increased cash inflow, most of that will be taken up with an increase in CapEx. So same amount of cash, around GBP 360 million. We've already either paid or declared GBP 165 million of that as special dividends, and we will pay out further GBP 180 million as special dividends or buybacks depending on the share price.\r\nMoving on to the detail of the accounts and starting with retail. This is a picture of our -- of the smaller end of our new Hedge End shop, and we see that glorious scene of industrial wasteland in the distance. Sales up 4.8%. In terms of how that was driven, 3.4% from new space and 1.4% from the sales that dare not speak their name, very rare occurrence of growth in existing stores.  And I'd like you all to enjoy this moment because I don't think it's one you will be seeing in the year ahead and certainly haven't seen for many years previous. In terms of the driving of that growth, 4.3% increase in space gave us the 3.4% increase in sales. That's unusual because it's a return of 78% on the new space, and this is all about the fact that we haven't got a lot of high-density big stores as Basildon, Maidstone, Hedge End, all of which are very good trading locations and big stores. So relatively high pounds per square foot. So you should expect that figure to return to near 65% in the year ahead. \r\nIn terms of stores, we actually decreased the number of stores we trade in by 2. We moved or opened new trading locations and 20 stores, extended 7 and closed 22. In terms of the performance of the new space against the sales targets that we set in our appraisal, they beat target by 10%, payback of 20 months and a store profit, that's the net store profit before any essential overheads of 20% in those new stores. Now for the supersharp amongst you which is, of course, is almost all of you, you instantly look at those numbers and go hold on a second, if they were 10% up against that target and payback of 20 months, that must mean at their target, they would have been very close to if not over the 24 months payback, what's going on here? NEXT becoming too relaxed in their capital expenditure? And the answer is if we come in at 0, then that figure of 20 would have been almost exactly 24. And the reason for that is that we did actually lose in our capital requirements for 2 of our very big new sales build shops that we have and Hedge End being the main one of those where it was an experiment and we took a view on the capital as it happens that they have payback in around 24 months but we haven't planned for this one to do that. \r\nLooking at our profit analysis. Some improvement, 0.8% improvement in net operating margin in retail. Adverse movement of 0.4% as a result of markdown. This is also all about stock -- sale for stock increasing faster than sales, and that's mainly as a result of the autumn/winter sale and markdown sales increasing less than stock. So a double blow there. If the stock had increased more than sales, that sales would've driven down margin. By the fact that clearance rates dropped, drove it down a little bit more. \r\nBought-in gross margin, an improvement of 0.5%. 0.2% of that was as a result of us achieving slightly better currency rates that we have been putting on our costing. Our costing rates and 0.3% [ph] of it was a planned increase in our home furniture margins where we weren't happy with the levels of profitability in some of our home stand-alone stores on furniture and thought we needed to raise that. \r\nStore payroll adverse movement to 0.3%. That would've been an adverse movement of 0.6%, mainly driven by the fact that we gave our staff -- our lowest paid staff, a 6% pay rise in June of last year. 0.3% of that were mitigated through productivity improvements. \r\nStore occupancy cost, a big improvement here. That improvement is overstated by around 0.5% as a result of large write-offs this time last year, of various store equipment and some shops. So that figures a little bit [indiscernible].  The balance point is such real improvement as a result of like-for-like increases and the fact that the stores -- the new stores we're taking on have a slightly low rent to sales ratio than the ones that we're closing. \r\nCentral overheads, adverse movement of 0.1%. In terms of Directory, sales up 12.1%. In terms of what's driving that, 3 -- this breaks the growth down to 3 parts of business. 5.7% of the growth coming from NEXT, branded stock in the U.K, roundabout the same -- sorry, more growth coming from the combination of selling branded stock in the U.K. and NEXT branded stock overseas. In terms of customer base, active customers up 11%. The issue here is the drop in credit customers, which will -- which is likely to have an adverse effect on profitability. I'm going to deal with that in more detail later. \r\nOverall profit, up 5, so big drop in margin. Still very healthy margin at Directory, 24.5% but a drop in margin. And just standing back from all the detail that I will rattle through at normal speed. Standing back, this is all about 2 things, it's about the growth of LABEL and the growth of international, both of which are lower net margins than NEXT core U.K. business. We're not worried about that because both of them healthy margins and we believe both as incremental business. So we think it'll be childish for us to say we're going to grow our overseas business because it only makes 18%.  But the fact that it does only make 18% means that it's likely to bring down the net margins of the business as a gross as a participation of the total. \r\nMarkdown, adverse movement to 0.4% for much of the same reasons as retail but slightly more so. Bought-in gross margin, adversely movement to 0.1%. Directory got the same benefit from currency, the same benefit from improvement in home bought-in gross margin. But the low margin on LABEL and a low bought-in gross margin on the overseas stock brought that margin down. \r\nStock write-offs, most of which were one-offs, brought margin down by 0.3%. We have one big issue with [indiscernible] on the sofa that we had to write-off. The other 0.2% erosion here refer -- it really relates to the way we bring stock back, particularly the way we bring back -- stock back to the stores. We get a lot more of our returns back to the stores, and our stores are not as good at handling the stock as our current network. And that's meant a lot of stock has been damaged in transit coming back to the warehouses, and we can do a lot to improve that going forward. \r\nInterest income, adverse movement to 0.4%. Interest income did go up but not by as far as to sales. Bad debt, an improvement. The flip side of the credit book growing more slowly and as recruiting less new customers is that our bad debt profile is likely to improve. And that's because the worst assets are always your new customers. The best assets are your long saving customers. So the decline that means we will get slight improvement. Creation and print, this is all about LABEL and some of it -- most of that adverse movement is the fact that we took the costs of 2 LABEL brochures that whose sales fall in this year, we took last year. That process will annualize as we go through this year. So it will affect the sales again but that is about costs taken earlier. \r\nWarehouse and distribution, this is all about increased distribution cost getting stock to our overseas customers. \r\nCentral overheads, main element there is about the building of our Russian hub. In terms of the one-off movements and have taken our brand profit increase of 7.7% and our total group profit increased around 12.5%, 4 main things here. Just want to go through each one. First is the nonrecurring, GBP 15 million swing in unrealized foreign exchange. We would expect that number to be flat in the year ahead. Next, sourcing, real profit increase here, increased sales and reduced costs. Central costs, an improvement of GBP 7 million here and property management of GBP 5 million profit. The lion's share of which comes from a property sale on Oxford Street, but we do anticipate that we will make further property profits, both this year and next year from developments that we are doing. So we would anticipate that we won't lose that gain in profit. \r\nMoving on to the outlook. My job for the last 5 or 6 years has been to stand up for you every 6 months and tell you how depressing the U.K. economy looks. Sadly, I haven't got that. Pleasure today because everything's looking really good. Looking at, the black line is inflation, the white line is wages. You can see inflation -- price inflation coming down, wage is going up. And we think this is a really important change. For the first time really in 5 or 6 years, real wages are rising at material rates, and employment levels are remaining very strong. So where we're just looking at the economy, I think that we will be more positive than we are. And we certainly can't use the economy as an excuse for our cautiousness in the year ahead. But we are very cautious, we're particularly cautious in spring and summer of this year. Two things that we think will make the first half difficult. First is the weather last year, which we alluded to in September. We said the weather was helping us. This is the average weather in 2013, a relatively normal spring and summer, and that was the weather last year. So that definitely helped last year. In addition to that, we think that this time last year, we got all 5 of our rangers absolutely right. That is, it's not normal for us to get Home, men's wear, children's wear, women's clothing and women's nonclothing, get all the collections exactly where we want them. And this year is a much more normal year in there are collections that we're not happy with. It's not -- We don't think it's -- we haven't gotten unusually large number of collections that are -- with we're not happy with. It's just to return to a more normal level. So I think that's both in terms of the weather and our own wages last year, we've got a very steep hill to climb in the first 2 quarters. The second 2 quarters present, we think, potentially an upside risk to our numbers. However, obviously, there is political uncertainty. You never know who's going to be in charge and they may just bite off, may bite off more than they can chew. And the one thing you can be absolutely certain of is that a preelection budget will always be a far more generous than a postelection budget pretty much whoever is in charge. And just in case you think that this is an outrageous act of political bias, I think it is just even things out with another politician biting off more than he can chew but at the same time proving that he is a man of the people. So there we go. All of that added up means that we think that spring and summer will be up between 0% and 3%, autumn and winter between 3.5% and 7.5%. Overall for the full year, we are working on a range of 1.5% to 5.5%, which means that our central guidance is around 3.5%. And just for clarity, all the numbers that I'm going to talk about for the rest of this presentation in terms of profit guidance and sales guidance are based on that 3.5% full year growth in full price sales. In terms of where we think that growth will come from, we think the same stores will decline by GBP 40 million. New space will contribute to GBP 65 million. So retail just managing to sort of move forward by GBP 15 million NEXT U.K., we think is going to be slow, around GBP 10 million increase. LABEL, we think will contribute GBP 40 million. Overseas, another GBP 40 million to get us to the GBP 115 million, 3.5% number. In terms of what we're doing to make sure that those numbers are as good as they can possibly be, I'm starting with existing stores, you will remember that at this point last year, I showed you rather depressing piece of market research that ranks NEXT against 10 of our biggest competitors on the high street. This is the percentage of customers that rated NEXT outstanding or very good. And as you can see, we're not proud of that. Over the last 18 months, as a result of that survey, we have gone back and looked at the way we contract with our staff to give them better and longer contracts. We've increased our pay rates. We've got a new bonus scheme that incentivizes staff not on sales but on the service surveys that they have in their stores. We'll change the way we recruit for the attitude and personality of the person we're looking at rather than their experience in retail. We got a new appraisal system. We've introduced a shift marketplace that allows staff to go on and take extra shifts on their iPhone when we got extra work to be done and also allows them to offer up their own shifts for other people to take. And we've increased our peak time staffing in order to improve service at the busiest times of day. As well as all those things, the survey that we did in -- that was done in November, this is done by third-party, moved us from that sixth, seventh position to third. We still think we've got a lot more to do on this but there is definitely being some improvement. Our main focus in the year ahead is going to be looking at the temporary staff we bring in for summer and winter. And again, I think, we've got similar levels of opportunity to improve the terms and contracts and training for our temporary staff. We've also looked this is just really the interest at the weak spots because people's perception of service is about continuity and you can have 9 great experiences and not noticed and a bad 1 and spend the rest of the day banging on about it. As many of my friends do to me if they have had a bad experience in my shop or indeed any shop, they will complain to me for some reason. Just for your interest, days of the week. We took these surveys and looked what days they fell on. And it is quite surprising, the worst day by long way was Wednesday. You'd expect to be Saturday, the busiest day, in fact Wednesday, anyone want to have a guess? No, not you. You know the answer.\n\n---\n\nIt is the manager staff.\n\n---\n\nIt is the manager staff. You read the answers well without thinking about it. That is the most common day for the manager to take off so they are. Time of day, you'd expect if the Chief Executive anything to go buy, you'd expect the bad time of the day to be the morning when everyone is grumpy. In fact, quite the reverse. The big problem is 3 p.m. to late.  Not surprising when you think about it but there is a chance to really target those areas. I think I wanted to talk about is new space but rather than I'll give you -- every year, we give you the numbers of what we've done in the year. What I thought we'd do today is just take a sort of slightly longer view looking at space growth from 2008 to sort of the beginning of the credit crunch to 2015 and see what -- how the portfolio has changed over that time. 2008, we had 502 stores. We've moved or opened at new locations in 179 shops. We've extended 82. This will be a significant extension normally where we'd refit, regift the lease and refit the whole shop and we closed 142. So we moved our stores forward by about 40 stores. What's interesting -- 40 stores -- what's interesting is that when you look at the number of stores that we've refit, moved or extended, it's around half of our portfolio. So half of our portfolio to our customers' eyes will look new or in the words of the car industry, nearly new. If you look at that in square footage terms, 4.4 million square feet of our current 7.3 million will either be new or significantly refitted. It's around 60% of our space. Another slightly -- so the scary number really which is that our square footage has gone up by 42%. Our sales in retail have only gone up by 4%. And I think if I told you in 2008 that this was the plan, then I might not be standing here today to tell you how it works out. And I should stress that actually, there isn't a grand plan at NEXT. We expand our stores on a location-by-location basis. So we will decide what's right for Bath, Straiton in Edinburg or Bristol and we will look on a location-by-location basis, what is the best configuration, the way we can make most money in this trading location? And what's interesting is that despite the fall in pounds per square foot, the profitability -- the store profitability has actually improved by just over 2%. And just to sort of run through the sort of comparative economics of that, first thing is wages. We haven't seen any this economies of scale on wages as a result of having large shops. So wages are driven really by customers and unit volumes, not by square footage. And we've managed to make up for the inflation gains -- inflationary increases in wages with productivity improvements and the way we manage our staff. When rates and depreciation have not moved forward nearly as much as you would expect them to, with the fall in pounds per square foot, particularly rent and depreciation. This is partly because we will take a very conservative and aggressive view on depreciation, a correct view in my view. And secondly, because the new space were opening, it tends to be at a lower rents relative to sales than the space we're closing. And that's all about the retail environment and retail rents adjusting to reflect the new retail environment because it's not just NEXT stores that move back in terms of pounds per square foot, rents per square foot have also moved back. The real gain has actually come in markdown and shrinkage, quite a big gain in shrinkage and that's about our new system for managing stock, and a big drop in markdown. And there's a slight irony here in that one of the drivers of lower pounds per square foot has been the success of online -- of our online business, but the online business because it's far more effective at clearing stock than the old catalog business was, because it has livestock availability for customers in the way that catalog didn't, means that Directory can now take its fair share of the drop stock and that's reduced retail's markdown costs. So that was quite an interesting view of the economics of what's happened. In terms of the flexibility of our store portfolio, that has also changed. Again, this is about the -- a change in the nature of the retail rental environment. If we look at the percentage of our leases expiring in any number of given years time, in January 2008, 50% of the store portfolio would've expired or had a break in 10 years -- just over 10 years. If you look at the portfolio today, the equivalent figure is around 6 years. So not only is the portfolio more profitable, it's also much more flexible than it was in 2008. And that means if we see further declines in like for like, we hope that we will continue to be able to change the economics of our stores to match whatever retail reality is out there. The byproducts of opening so much new space has been that we've been able to change the perception of what NEXT is all about. This is one of our 2 old stores in Maidstone, which we shut. This is the new store on the edge of town that we replaced it with. And what we're trying to do with these buildings is to change people's perception of what out-of-town is all about. So people's perception of out-of-town is of windowless sheds that might hold beautiful stock, might hold cattle, you can retail from the outside, corrugated plastic and sort of tumbleweed and rubbish sort of going around the cowpox. And the town doesn't need to be like that. And what I hope you can see from this building is that actually this is a really nice building with an emphasis on getting massive light into building from the sides and through the roof. And that's it before it was completed. Once we completed it, we were able to create something that was actually far more iconic in the way that it looks and this is what we're really aiming at with the relatively small number of stores that we're building from scratch. We want to build buildings that if you took the next stop and people might think it was a civic building, sort of a return to -- sort of a grand retail architecture, which we think that the brand good but also the does the whole course of out-of-town shopping good as well. We haven't forgotten our in-town stores. This is just some shots from our new bath store where we're also making an effort to improve the architecture of the stores in town as well where we're moving them. So in summary, 2008, 2015, we increased our square footage by 42%. We've refit or have new 60% of our square feet and retail profit partly as a result of a small increase in sales and small improvement in margin, is up 20% over those 8 years.\r\nIn terms of Directory, 2 things to talk about here. The first is an issue with the Directory business, which is all about the decline of our credit business. You'll remember that we started talking about Directory with this slide showing a 3% decline in the number of U.K. credit customers. That's an issue because, obviously, although the customer base as a whole, is growing very healthily, the U.K. credit customers are our most profitable segment. This just shows sort of history. You can see really since 2009, total sales have grown faster than credit sales. And this is all about the fact that we've made it much easier for our customers to go online and to use their credit or debit cards rather than open an account, which was the traditional way of doing business with sort of old catalog book. What's interesting about this, which mitigates the scale of the potential erosion margin is that the credit sales have not fallen nearly as fast as the credit account customers. And the reason for that is that the customers that we you're losing are the ones who used the credit account least and the ones that are staying with this are growing the sales. Again, that doesn't cure the problem but it slows down the extent to which it hits the business. In addition, the interest income in the last year, has grown slightly faster than credit sales. The reason for that is because if you look at our credit customer base, those who have accounts, 20% payoff on the nose every month. 80% in one way or another use their credit account. If you look at the customers who are leaving, only 50% of those customers were making use of the credit account. So the customers we're losing are the ones who are most likely not to want to use the credit anyway. Again, neither of those things eliminate the problem. And they just change the speed at which it will affect the business. \r\nIn terms of profitability, the difference is not quite as great as you might initially think. Product margin on an account for an account customer, the actual trade on the clothes, makes around 17%. The net interest income, after all the costs and bad debt, is around 8%. If you look at a for a cash customer, the 17% product margin increases by 4% because they have a much lower returns rate. One of the advantages of having an account is that you can get the stock, try it on, send it back, and if you return it within 28 days, you wouldn't incur any interest. So off the customers you have an account, spend more with us, but they also returned for more stock. In addition to that, the cash customers are far less likely to request catalog and the customers who request a catalog are more expensive to service than those who don't, even though they pay for it, cost does a lot more to produce and distribute and just to produce and distribute that has low catalog customers pay for it. So the difference is around 2.5% in profitability. It's still a material number, but it's not nearly as big as you might think when you initially look at it. The real issue here is I think far more important issue for the business in a way is the fact that cash customers spend less with us. So the average spend of a cash customer is significantly lower than a credit customer. So the failure to recruit new credit customers is likely to slow growth in top line as well as the road margin. So that there is an issue on margin but potentially a bigger issue on sales. In terms of mitigation, 2 things that we're looking at. The first is we're changing the minimum payment from 9% of balance to a more industry normal 5%. Again, slows down the problem, doesn't cure it. The second thing we're doing is we'll begin to market the account unlike other major companies. We've never actually marketed our account. Let's see, this is the most marketing that we do, which is a pay on account or pay now and that's it. We think there are advantages of having an account, whether that be the ability to spread your payments, they try before you buy without incurring interest or the fact that our account customers get priority access to our VIP sale. We think there are things that we can do most of our credit business, and we'll be experimenting with those over the next 6 months. You shouldn't assume that any of them will be successful, but I want you to know that we are trying them, and we will report more fully on that in 6 months time, once we have a feel for what levels of success we're getting with it. In terms of U.K., next-day delivery service, store and Home was 10 p.m. this time last year. In September, we moved the stores back to midnight. We didn't really market that because it was -- it's quite confusing message to say midnight cutoff for stores, 10 p.m. for Home. We've just moved our cutoff for Home back to 11 p.m., and we'll be moving it back to 12 p.m. by August of this year. So by the time we launch the autumn book, we had to have midnight delivery for both stores and Home, which we think is a bit of a game changer for the U.K. market, but not as exciting as you might think because the sales that we take between 8 and 10, 21%, and this is basically -- this is the put your kids to bed, have a bit of supper order close. The 10 p.m. is actually only 9% and this is the go to the part and to get home and order. And we might experience high returns rates on these than we were initially expecting. So I don't think -- I think in terms of sales leverage, the 10 to midnight improvement is not nearly as big as the 8 to 10 leverage, but it is a bit of a game changer. And in terms of marketing service and what people think of it, it's a perception changer. And really, the capabilities of our delivery service that have led us to the LABEL business really, because our aim there is to take our delivery networks and our customer base, our 4 million customer base, and leverage it to sell noncompeting brands, all of which are significantly more expensive than NEXT. And over the last year, we have had a lot of success with this, and we're just beginning to get traction more and more brands. The big battle here is recruiting the brands. The stock is -- all of the stock is available on the next website as a dedicated part of the next website. Some of it, about 50% of it is available in our catalogs, all of it is available on the dedicated LABEL online website and 4 LABEL catalogs that published to coincide with the launch of our spring/summer and autumn/winter ranges. And sales performance has been good. That is the -- we increased sales of around GBP 30 million -- sorry, GBP 21 million the year just gone. We think we'll get further traction, about GBP 40 million sales in the year ahead. In terms of profitability, net margins of the business dropped last year. And part of the reason for that is the planned transition of partner brands from wholesale to commission basis. The wholesale business is a much higher margin for us and therefore good for profitability. But there's an enormous overhead in us sitting down and buying stock off the brands, which may not be appropriate for the customers. Certainly, won't be the best stock. We believe operational commission, which gives them much higher profits and potentially the highest, the most profitable route-to-market working on a commission basis means that we will enable them to select the best product at their risk for the next stretch and certainly on the brands that we switched from wholesale to commission, we have seen a big move forward in sales. We anticipate the profitability on this business before any interest income be around 15%, and that's the target that we are working to for the LABEL business. There is a question as to how much this will affect NEXT sales and certainly when we started the business, we anticipated that there will be some attrition of NEXT sales as a result of selling the stock. The only trial on this would indicate that the issue isn't a great one. We did a trial where we took 100,000 customers whose average sales on NEXT is 315 and who are already ordering around GBP 65 million of the brands through the back end of our book. We then took an identical demographic and sent a LABEL book to them. Unsurprisingly, the people we sent the LABEL catalog too spend much more on brands. Interestingly, the loss on NEXT sales was -- there wasn't a loss on NEXT sales. Actually, NEXT sales moved forward by 3%. Now there is an argument -- and actually , this is a repeat of the experience. There is an argument to say that if you can persuade people to come to your site for any reason that you more likely to pick up sales, my own view is that in the long run, actually, we will see some attrition, but the evidence we've got about attrition will be minimal. I certainly don't think you should assume that so not more NEXT stock as result of having other people's brands on us on our site, but I think the evidence we've got was suggested as not going to be a big problem for us. And, of course, 50% of the orders are subsequently picked up in our stores and so drive retail footfall. \r\nMoving on to Directory overseas. Continued very strong growth in this business, maintained margin of 18%. We anticipate in the year ahead, the growth will not be as strong in the year ahead as it has been, partly because we've now opened in all the countries that we want to open in. And our focus will be on improving our distribution and delivery times. So Germany and France, when we opened service, we ran it for 2 years on a 4- to 5-day delivery time. We looked at the speed at which we picked and packed the stock, how fast we can deliver it to various airports that the stock flies from, we've reduced that lead time now to 1 to 2 days with 80% of our customers in those countries on weekdays getting their stock within 1 day. \r\nSo next-day delivery 4 days of the week for our German customers, about 80% of our German customers. And we have seen significant sales move forward as a result of that improvement. We opened our first hub in Belfast last year. I've told you about that hub and the service improvements we got from it. It has served as a test bed for we can do elsewhere. \r\nWe're opening a hub in Moscow within the next month. Currently, our delivery promise in Russia is 8 to 12 days and returns cost the customer GBP 18, because they have to pay for those returns to be sent back to the U.K. Once we've opened the hub,  I noted [ph] that I should say, we spent GBP 2.5 million on it. There it is in almost GBP 2.5 million worth of glory. We'll have about GBP 0.5 million worth of that is a call center within the building. When we got to open, 60% of our customers will have delivery within 1 or 2 days. Moscow and St. Petersburgh will be next-day and the price of returns, on average, will drop to around GBP 3. Obviously -- and I can tell there's a slight silence in the room, because you're all thinking this is not the best time to be investing in the Russian Federation and you would be absolutely right.  One of the reasons that we're anticipating slower growth in the year ahead is because of the effect that the oil price and troubles we've had on the Russian currency. Currency is down 40%. In order to maintain our profitability, we have to put our ruble prices up by 43%, not enough to cope -- not enough to compensate fully for the drop in currency. Our sales in rubles are still up 45%. So we're still growing the business in ruble terms. However, that's not much consolation, because both prices and sales in pounds terms are down and profitability has halved from 18% to 9%. We're going to press on with this investment, mainly because we've made it all. And we think that if and when the Russian economy stabilizes and the currency stabilizes, we think we have got the basis of building a good business, but it will depend on the political situation but you can see even at the current levels of pricing and profitability, it's not a bad business. \r\nWe opened in China last year. And I was skeptical as to whether we could do well in China at all. Actually, the business has done much better than we thought it was going to do, and it has given us room for encouragement. It's coming in at around 10th or 11th country in our rankings at the moment, and we think we'll grow within that ranking. When we started delivering, it was 21 days. We've recently reduced it to 14-day delivery time. We're investing and we're opening a third-party hub. So we're going to be putting a lot of money into this having to [ph] putting any capital really of any description into the hub. And we aim to have it opened sometime later in the year, and then we think that we can get 60% of our customers within 1 or 2 days once we're opened -- once we go into hub. That hub will also service Taiwan, Hong Kong and Japan. \r\nIn terms of looking at the sales and profit guidance, here is our normal red and green arrows chart, which I won't go through in painful detail. Suffice to say that our full year brand sales are going -- with think it will be up at least 1.5% and 5.5%. Profit before tax at either ends of those levels, we think will be between 0.4% and 6.7%. And obviously, getting some negative and positive leverage over sales either end of the sales ranges. Ordinary dividends taken as a percentage of our average share price at the beginning of the year, which is -- as it happens, 72 33, with 2.1%. Special dividend yield or buybacks, earning and also from buybacks will be 3.3% depending on where the share price settles. At the moment, just to remind you, our target share price our buybacks is 68 27. [ph] That is total shareholder return of EPS growth plus dividends, so somewhere between 5.8% and 12.1%. We think those returns in today's market are not at the bottom end not unacceptable and the top end, very good. But by our historical standards, they are not viewed [ph] as good as we have delivered. You can see this is just a total shareholder returns we delivered over the last 5 years. And I suppose one of the things that I should stress is, first of all, we think our sales estimate are reasonable and definitely reasonable for the first 2 quarters, which are going to be very tough. The second thing is that there is a temptation in all retail business, I guess, to want to push sales harder than they would actually grow. And I want to reassure you that, next we'll not do that. We are setting budgets with very realistic levels. That means that we'll be managing our most important cost, our stock, but also all our other costs in the business at least very conservative levels. And if we do that and we believe we can deliver respectable returns this year, but more importantly, continue to build our business operations in the U.K. whether that be NEXT operations, brandied operations and NEXT operations overseas, we can still -- we can lay the foundations for better growth in the years ahead, which will be our focus for the year ahead. So that is the slightly flat finish to what was otherwise a painless presentation.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: R. Barton (Executives)】\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to our annual results presentation. I'm going to be very brief this morning because Simon's got quite a fulsome report to make to you all. First of all, I'd just like to say last year was a very good year for us again, remarkably the sixth consecutive year that we've grown our earnings per share by 15% or more, which I think is a very major achievement through a difficult economic time. Sales were up 7%, and we've gone through the GBP 4 billion mark for the first time. More importantly, we've returned GBP 572 million, virtually all our free cash flow, to our shareholders in buybacks or dividends. You'll notice in Simon's report that we've highlighted the total shareholders' return of 19%, which is also pretty good, but we feel that now we're doing special dividends that we ought to look at the total shareholders' return as another measure as well as EPS. So we will continue to track that as we go forward. You are more interested in hearing Simon tell you how we did that and what our prospects are in the year ahead. So I'll pass it onto Simon. Simon?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Simon Wolfson (Executives)】\nThank you, Chairman. Very flattering of you to suggest they're going to be interested but I'll do my best. It was a good year for NEXT but a very much, to use an old cliché, a year of two halves. At the beginning of the year, we -- at this point last year, we forecasted our profits to be up 8% at GBP 750 million. We then had 2 amazing quarters. Those 2 quarters were really the second and third quarter of a three-quarter run are very good seasons. Rather rationally, we put our forecast at GBP 795 million. And at that time, there were some accusations and we were being overly cautious. And it turned out, third quarter, we issued what I'm not allowed to call a profit's warning -- Alister gets very annoyed -- it was a minor adjustment to our guidance. And we came in at 5% in third quarter, which was very disappointing. I mean, at that point, we forecast 1% up in the fourth quarter. As it turned out, we did slightly better than that, up 3%. Full year profits came in at GBP 782 million boosted significantly by some group profits. And the underlying profits from the brand were up pretty much in line with sales, around 7.7%. Just looking at those 4 quarters, it's important to see what's actually going on underneath the numbers because the fourth quarter looks like the worst. If you compare it to 2 years, that's the 2-year growth in each of those quarters. What you can see is that the fourth quarter, because it hit the overperformance of the year before, actually in 2-year terms was as good as any other quarter. And it's really the third quarter that was the underperformer and that was when we had the period of very warm weather. And I suppose the important point about this chart is that the experience in quarter 4, you can use as a predictor for the experience that we like to have in quarter 1 and quarter 2. \r\nJust going back to the accounts, GBP 782 million is what we made. Total sales were up 7.2%. Total operating profit up 12.3%. You should really look at that at the very most of being 11.1% up because there was GBP 9 million currency gain. This is not a real gain. It's basically an accounting adjustment, accounting profit on instruments that we use to hedge out the following year's purchases. So it is purely an accounting measure but is not a real profit, and we'd expect that to reverse out in the year ahead.\r\nTaxation, the same as last year. Last year, our tax reduced a lot by a tax win. This year, it was reduced a little bit by another tax win. In the year ahead, we expect it to be around about the same, around 20.5% as the tax rate -- corporate tax rate continues to come down, subject to any changes that might be made after May. Profit after tax up 12.5%. Earnings per share up 14.7%. That's being boosted by not only last year's buybacks but the buybacks at the end of the previous year.\r\nMoving on to cash flow. Capital expenditure. Capital expenditure on stores slightly down on last year. The drop is down to spending less on cosmetic refix that we did in the previous year, about GBP 5 million less on cosmetics refix than the previous year. \r\nIn terms of other expenditure around the business, GBP 18 million on new IT building, upgrading some of our product buildings and GBP 2 million spent on the beginnings of replacing all of our till systems. Just in terms -- in case you think we're blowing money on fancy head offices, this is just to give you an insight into the beauteous and wonderful head office that we work in that is, in fact, the old Kendall's building that was our systems department and the money we spent on the IT building is to turn into that. So we bought for the front increased space by 60%. So it is a -- and our head office complex is one that needs a little bit of expenditure and it's a bit out of date. But just to give you a feeling for -- when we used to interview people for the systems team, we used to interview them on a different building from the one that end up working in. I'm sure many banks have similar systems department. Warehousing, GBP 12 million in the year. This is all about automating part of our home warehouse for furniture. Looking forward to the year ahead, we expect slightly more expenditure on new stores, partly because we're in -- we anticipate opening slightly more new space and partly because we anticipate spending a little bit more on cosmetic, about GBP 5 million more on new space, about GBP 5 million more on cosmetic. A further GBP 11 million on head office infrastructure. That's to build a new children's wear department, new -- update our call center and new photographic studio and to finish the systems building and then GBP 5 million on rolling out the new till systems, which that rollout process will begin in about 2 or 3 months' time. \r\nThe big change in CapEx is in warehousing. Here we're going to spend GBP 27 million. This is to fit out a new home warehouse. This will be fully automated storage and retrieval of large palletized items such as flat-pack furniture, made-up furniture and sofas. That is just the cost of the fit out. The cost of the building is being unfitted. That's being paid for by the landlord. So we'll be renting the building. \r\nMoving on to working capital. The swing here is all about the slowdown in the growth of the Directory credit base. Cash returns to shareholders, GBP 572 million. Ordinary dividends, up considerably on last year. A lot of that increase is about the rebalancing of our interim and final dividend because we increased the interim far more than the final and that distorts some increase, GBP 138 million on buybacks, GBP 223 million on special dividends.\r\nMoving on to the balance sheet. Stock up 8%, where levels of stock that we think are about normal. This is not the level of sales growth we're expecting. The main reason for the increase in stock this year was because at the end of last year, because we had a very good fourth quarter, we were beginning to run out of stock. We pull forward lot of the summer stock to sell in the autumn season and we spent the whole of the summer and spring seasons -- we spent with stock levels that were too low. And then we had a very good end-of-season sale. So you should expect part of -- you should expect a bigger end-of-season sale at the end of the summer season this year than last year. \r\nDebt is up 4.5%. This is all being driven by an increase in the Directory debtor book, which is up broadly in line with credit sales. Net debt year end, around the same as last year. Just to remind you of how that was made up, GBP 363 million of operational cash flow, paid out in share buybacks and special dividends. Looking to the year ahead, we're expecting a similar amount of cash inflow. The reason that we're not anticipating an increase is largely because of the change in CapEx. So although we're anticipating that it will increase our profits and, therefore, increased cash inflow, most of that will be taken up with an increase in CapEx. So same amount of cash, around GBP 360 million. We've already either paid or declared GBP 165 million of that as special dividends, and we will pay out further GBP 180 million as special dividends or buybacks depending on the share price.\r\nMoving on to the detail of the accounts and starting with retail. This is a picture of our -- of the smaller end of our new Hedge End shop, and we see that glorious scene of industrial wasteland in the distance. Sales up 4.8%. In terms of how that was driven, 3.4% from new space and 1.4% from the sales that dare not speak their name, very rare occurrence of growth in existing stores.  And I'd like you all to enjoy this moment because I don't think it's one you will be seeing in the year ahead and certainly haven't seen for many years previous. In terms of the driving of that growth, 4.3% increase in space gave us the 3.4% increase in sales. That's unusual because it's a return of 78% on the new space, and this is all about the fact that we haven't got a lot of high-density big stores as Basildon, Maidstone, Hedge End, all of which are very good trading locations and big stores. So relatively high pounds per square foot. So you should expect that figure to return to near 65% in the year ahead. \r\nIn terms of stores, we actually decreased the number of stores we trade in by 2. We moved or opened new trading locations and 20 stores, extended 7 and closed 22. In terms of the performance of the new space against the sales targets that we set in our appraisal, they beat target by 10%, payback of 20 months and a store profit, that's the net store profit before any essential overheads of 20% in those new stores. Now for the supersharp amongst you which is, of course, is almost all of you, you instantly look at those numbers and go hold on a second, if they were 10% up against that target and payback of 20 months, that must mean at their target, they would have been very close to if not over the 24 months payback, what's going on here? NEXT becoming too relaxed in their capital expenditure? And the answer is if we come in at 0, then that figure of 20 would have been almost exactly 24. And the reason for that is that we did actually lose in our capital requirements for 2 of our very big new sales build shops that we have and Hedge End being the main one of those where it was an experiment and we took a view on the capital as it happens that they have payback in around 24 months but we haven't planned for this one to do that. \r\nLooking at our profit analysis. Some improvement, 0.8% improvement in net operating margin in retail. Adverse movement of 0.4% as a result of markdown. This is also all about stock -- sale for stock increasing faster than sales, and that's mainly as a result of the autumn/winter sale and markdown sales increasing less than stock. So a double blow there. If the stock had increased more than sales, that sales would've driven down margin. By the fact that clearance rates dropped, drove it down a little bit more. \r\nBought-in gross margin, an improvement of 0.5%. 0.2% of that was as a result of us achieving slightly better currency rates that we have been putting on our costing. Our costing rates and 0.3% [ph] of it was a planned increase in our home furniture margins where we weren't happy with the levels of profitability in some of our home stand-alone stores on furniture and thought we needed to raise that. \r\nStore payroll adverse movement to 0.3%. That would've been an adverse movement of 0.6%, mainly driven by the fact that we gave our staff -- our lowest paid staff, a 6% pay rise in June of last year. 0.3% of that were mitigated through productivity improvements. \r\nStore occupancy cost, a big improvement here. That improvement is overstated by around 0.5% as a result of large write-offs this time last year, of various store equipment and some shops. So that figures a little bit [indiscernible].  The balance point is such real improvement as a result of like-for-like increases and the fact that the stores -- the new stores we're taking on have a slightly low rent to sales ratio than the ones that we're closing. \r\nCentral overheads, adverse movement of 0.1%. In terms of Directory, sales up 12.1%. In terms of what's driving that, 3 -- this breaks the growth down to 3 parts of business. 5.7% of the growth coming from NEXT, branded stock in the U.K, roundabout the same -- sorry, more growth coming from the combination of selling branded stock in the U.K. and NEXT branded stock overseas. In terms of customer base, active customers up 11%. The issue here is the drop in credit customers, which will -- which is likely to have an adverse effect on profitability. I'm going to deal with that in more detail later. \r\nOverall profit, up 5, so big drop in margin. Still very healthy margin at Directory, 24.5% but a drop in margin. And just standing back from all the detail that I will rattle through at normal speed. Standing back, this is all about 2 things, it's about the growth of LABEL and the growth of international, both of which are lower net margins than NEXT core U.K. business. We're not worried about that because both of them healthy margins and we believe both as incremental business. So we think it'll be childish for us to say we're going to grow our overseas business because it only makes 18%.  But the fact that it does only make 18% means that it's likely to bring down the net margins of the business as a gross as a participation of the total. \r\nMarkdown, adverse movement to 0.4% for much of the same reasons as retail but slightly more so. Bought-in gross margin, adversely movement to 0.1%. Directory got the same benefit from currency, the same benefit from improvement in home bought-in gross margin. But the low margin on LABEL and a low bought-in gross margin on the overseas stock brought that margin down. \r\nStock write-offs, most of which were one-offs, brought margin down by 0.3%. We have one big issue with [indiscernible] on the sofa that we had to write-off. The other 0.2% erosion here refer -- it really relates to the way we bring stock back, particularly the way we bring back -- stock back to the stores. We get a lot more of our returns back to the stores, and our stores are not as good at handling the stock as our current network. And that's meant a lot of stock has been damaged in transit coming back to the warehouses, and we can do a lot to improve that going forward. \r\nInterest income, adverse movement to 0.4%. Interest income did go up but not by as far as to sales. Bad debt, an improvement. The flip side of the credit book growing more slowly and as recruiting less new customers is that our bad debt profile is likely to improve. And that's because the worst assets are always your new customers. The best assets are your long saving customers. So the decline that means we will get slight improvement. Creation and print, this is all about LABEL and some of it -- most of that adverse movement is the fact that we took the costs of 2 LABEL brochures that whose sales fall in this year, we took last year. That process will annualize as we go through this year. So it will affect the sales again but that is about costs taken earlier. \r\nWarehouse and distribution, this is all about increased distribution cost getting stock to our overseas customers. \r\nCentral overheads, main element there is about the building of our Russian hub. In terms of the one-off movements and have taken our brand profit increase of 7.7% and our total group profit increased around 12.5%, 4 main things here. Just want to go through each one. First is the nonrecurring, GBP 15 million swing in unrealized foreign exchange. We would expect that number to be flat in the year ahead. Next, sourcing, real profit increase here, increased sales and reduced costs. Central costs, an improvement of GBP 7 million here and property management of GBP 5 million profit. The lion's share of which comes from a property sale on Oxford Street, but we do anticipate that we will make further property profits, both this year and next year from developments that we are doing. So we would anticipate that we won't lose that gain in profit. \r\nMoving on to the outlook. My job for the last 5 or 6 years has been to stand up for you every 6 months and tell you how depressing the U.K. economy looks. Sadly, I haven't got that. Pleasure today because everything's looking really good. Looking at, the black line is inflation, the white line is wages. You can see inflation -- price inflation coming down, wage is going up. And we think this is a really important change. For the first time really in 5 or 6 years, real wages are rising at material rates, and employment levels are remaining very strong. So where we're just looking at the economy, I think that we will be more positive than we are. And we certainly can't use the economy as an excuse for our cautiousness in the year ahead. But we are very cautious, we're particularly cautious in spring and summer of this year. Two things that we think will make the first half difficult. First is the weather last year, which we alluded to in September. We said the weather was helping us. This is the average weather in 2013, a relatively normal spring and summer, and that was the weather last year. So that definitely helped last year. In addition to that, we think that this time last year, we got all 5 of our rangers absolutely right. That is, it's not normal for us to get Home, men's wear, children's wear, women's clothing and women's nonclothing, get all the collections exactly where we want them. And this year is a much more normal year in there are collections that we're not happy with. It's not -- We don't think it's -- we haven't gotten unusually large number of collections that are -- with we're not happy with. It's just to return to a more normal level. So I think that's both in terms of the weather and our own wages last year, we've got a very steep hill to climb in the first 2 quarters. The second 2 quarters present, we think, potentially an upside risk to our numbers. However, obviously, there is political uncertainty. You never know who's going to be in charge and they may just bite off, may bite off more than they can chew. And the one thing you can be absolutely certain of is that a preelection budget will always be a far more generous than a postelection budget pretty much whoever is in charge. And just in case you think that this is an outrageous act of political bias, I think it is just even things out with another politician biting off more than he can chew but at the same time proving that he is a man of the people. So there we go. All of that added up means that we think that spring and summer will be up between 0% and 3%, autumn and winter between 3.5% and 7.5%. Overall for the full year, we are working on a range of 1.5% to 5.5%, which means that our central guidance is around 3.5%. And just for clarity, all the numbers that I'm going to talk about for the rest of this presentation in terms of profit guidance and sales guidance are based on that 3.5% full year growth in full price sales. In terms of where we think that growth will come from, we think the same stores will decline by GBP 40 million. New space will contribute to GBP 65 million. So retail just managing to sort of move forward by GBP 15 million NEXT U.K., we think is going to be slow, around GBP 10 million increase. LABEL, we think will contribute GBP 40 million. Overseas, another GBP 40 million to get us to the GBP 115 million, 3.5% number. In terms of what we're doing to make sure that those numbers are as good as they can possibly be, I'm starting with existing stores, you will remember that at this point last year, I showed you rather depressing piece of market research that ranks NEXT against 10 of our biggest competitors on the high street. This is the percentage of customers that rated NEXT outstanding or very good. And as you can see, we're not proud of that. Over the last 18 months, as a result of that survey, we have gone back and looked at the way we contract with our staff to give them better and longer contracts. We've increased our pay rates. We've got a new bonus scheme that incentivizes staff not on sales but on the service surveys that they have in their stores. We'll change the way we recruit for the attitude and personality of the person we're looking at rather than their experience in retail. We got a new appraisal system. We've introduced a shift marketplace that allows staff to go on and take extra shifts on their iPhone when we got extra work to be done and also allows them to offer up their own shifts for other people to take. And we've increased our peak time staffing in order to improve service at the busiest times of day. As well as all those things, the survey that we did in -- that was done in November, this is done by third-party, moved us from that sixth, seventh position to third. We still think we've got a lot more to do on this but there is definitely being some improvement. Our main focus in the year ahead is going to be looking at the temporary staff we bring in for summer and winter. And again, I think, we've got similar levels of opportunity to improve the terms and contracts and training for our temporary staff. We've also looked this is just really the interest at the weak spots because people's perception of service is about continuity and you can have 9 great experiences and not noticed and a bad 1 and spend the rest of the day banging on about it. As many of my friends do to me if they have had a bad experience in my shop or indeed any shop, they will complain to me for some reason. Just for your interest, days of the week. We took these surveys and looked what days they fell on. And it is quite surprising, the worst day by long way was Wednesday. You'd expect to be Saturday, the busiest day, in fact Wednesday, anyone want to have a guess? No, not you. You know the answer.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nIt is the manager staff.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Simon Wolfson (Executives)】\nIt is the manager staff. You read the answers well without thinking about it. That is the most common day for the manager to take off so they are. Time of day, you'd expect if the Chief Executive anything to go buy, you'd expect the bad time of the day to be the morning when everyone is grumpy. In fact, quite the reverse. The big problem is 3 p.m. to late.  Not surprising when you think about it but there is a chance to really target those areas. I think I wanted to talk about is new space but rather than I'll give you -- every year, we give you the numbers of what we've done in the year. What I thought we'd do today is just take a sort of slightly longer view looking at space growth from 2008 to sort of the beginning of the credit crunch to 2015 and see what -- how the portfolio has changed over that time. 2008, we had 502 stores. We've moved or opened at new locations in 179 shops. We've extended 82. This will be a significant extension normally where we'd refit, regift the lease and refit the whole shop and we closed 142. So we moved our stores forward by about 40 stores. What's interesting -- 40 stores -- what's interesting is that when you look at the number of stores that we've refit, moved or extended, it's around half of our portfolio. So half of our portfolio to our customers' eyes will look new or in the words of the car industry, nearly new. If you look at that in square footage terms, 4.4 million square feet of our current 7.3 million will either be new or significantly refitted. It's around 60% of our space. Another slightly -- so the scary number really which is that our square footage has gone up by 42%. Our sales in retail have only gone up by 4%. And I think if I told you in 2008 that this was the plan, then I might not be standing here today to tell you how it works out. And I should stress that actually, there isn't a grand plan at NEXT. We expand our stores on a location-by-location basis. So we will decide what's right for Bath, Straiton in Edinburg or Bristol and we will look on a location-by-location basis, what is the best configuration, the way we can make most money in this trading location? And what's interesting is that despite the fall in pounds per square foot, the profitability -- the store profitability has actually improved by just over 2%. And just to sort of run through the sort of comparative economics of that, first thing is wages. We haven't seen any this economies of scale on wages as a result of having large shops. So wages are driven really by customers and unit volumes, not by square footage. And we've managed to make up for the inflation gains -- inflationary increases in wages with productivity improvements and the way we manage our staff. When rates and depreciation have not moved forward nearly as much as you would expect them to, with the fall in pounds per square foot, particularly rent and depreciation. This is partly because we will take a very conservative and aggressive view on depreciation, a correct view in my view. And secondly, because the new space were opening, it tends to be at a lower rents relative to sales than the space we're closing. And that's all about the retail environment and retail rents adjusting to reflect the new retail environment because it's not just NEXT stores that move back in terms of pounds per square foot, rents per square foot have also moved back. The real gain has actually come in markdown and shrinkage, quite a big gain in shrinkage and that's about our new system for managing stock, and a big drop in markdown. And there's a slight irony here in that one of the drivers of lower pounds per square foot has been the success of online -- of our online business, but the online business because it's far more effective at clearing stock than the old catalog business was, because it has livestock availability for customers in the way that catalog didn't, means that Directory can now take its fair share of the drop stock and that's reduced retail's markdown costs. So that was quite an interesting view of the economics of what's happened. In terms of the flexibility of our store portfolio, that has also changed. Again, this is about the -- a change in the nature of the retail rental environment. If we look at the percentage of our leases expiring in any number of given years time, in January 2008, 50% of the store portfolio would've expired or had a break in 10 years -- just over 10 years. If you look at the portfolio today, the equivalent figure is around 6 years. So not only is the portfolio more profitable, it's also much more flexible than it was in 2008. And that means if we see further declines in like for like, we hope that we will continue to be able to change the economics of our stores to match whatever retail reality is out there. The byproducts of opening so much new space has been that we've been able to change the perception of what NEXT is all about. This is one of our 2 old stores in Maidstone, which we shut. This is the new store on the edge of town that we replaced it with. And what we're trying to do with these buildings is to change people's perception of what out-of-town is all about. So people's perception of out-of-town is of windowless sheds that might hold beautiful stock, might hold cattle, you can retail from the outside, corrugated plastic and sort of tumbleweed and rubbish sort of going around the cowpox. And the town doesn't need to be like that. And what I hope you can see from this building is that actually this is a really nice building with an emphasis on getting massive light into building from the sides and through the roof. And that's it before it was completed. Once we completed it, we were able to create something that was actually far more iconic in the way that it looks and this is what we're really aiming at with the relatively small number of stores that we're building from scratch. We want to build buildings that if you took the next stop and people might think it was a civic building, sort of a return to -- sort of a grand retail architecture, which we think that the brand good but also the does the whole course of out-of-town shopping good as well. We haven't forgotten our in-town stores. This is just some shots from our new bath store where we're also making an effort to improve the architecture of the stores in town as well where we're moving them. So in summary, 2008, 2015, we increased our square footage by 42%. We've refit or have new 60% of our square feet and retail profit partly as a result of a small increase in sales and small improvement in margin, is up 20% over those 8 years.\r\nIn terms of Directory, 2 things to talk about here. The first is an issue with the Directory business, which is all about the decline of our credit business. You'll remember that we started talking about Directory with this slide showing a 3% decline in the number of U.K. credit customers. That's an issue because, obviously, although the customer base as a whole, is growing very healthily, the U.K. credit customers are our most profitable segment. This just shows sort of history. You can see really since 2009, total sales have grown faster than credit sales. And this is all about the fact that we've made it much easier for our customers to go online and to use their credit or debit cards rather than open an account, which was the traditional way of doing business with sort of old catalog book. What's interesting about this, which mitigates the scale of the potential erosion margin is that the credit sales have not fallen nearly as fast as the credit account customers. And the reason for that is that the customers that we you're losing are the ones who used the credit account least and the ones that are staying with this are growing the sales. Again, that doesn't cure the problem but it slows down the extent to which it hits the business. In addition, the interest income in the last year, has grown slightly faster than credit sales. The reason for that is because if you look at our credit customer base, those who have accounts, 20% payoff on the nose every month. 80% in one way or another use their credit account. If you look at the customers who are leaving, only 50% of those customers were making use of the credit account. So the customers we're losing are the ones who are most likely not to want to use the credit anyway. Again, neither of those things eliminate the problem. And they just change the speed at which it will affect the business. \r\nIn terms of profitability, the difference is not quite as great as you might initially think. Product margin on an account for an account customer, the actual trade on the clothes, makes around 17%. The net interest income, after all the costs and bad debt, is around 8%. If you look at a for a cash customer, the 17% product margin increases by 4% because they have a much lower returns rate. One of the advantages of having an account is that you can get the stock, try it on, send it back, and if you return it within 28 days, you wouldn't incur any interest. So off the customers you have an account, spend more with us, but they also returned for more stock. In addition to that, the cash customers are far less likely to request catalog and the customers who request a catalog are more expensive to service than those who don't, even though they pay for it, cost does a lot more to produce and distribute and just to produce and distribute that has low catalog customers pay for it. So the difference is around 2.5% in profitability. It's still a material number, but it's not nearly as big as you might think when you initially look at it. The real issue here is I think far more important issue for the business in a way is the fact that cash customers spend less with us. So the average spend of a cash customer is significantly lower than a credit customer. So the failure to recruit new credit customers is likely to slow growth in top line as well as the road margin. So that there is an issue on margin but potentially a bigger issue on sales. In terms of mitigation, 2 things that we're looking at. The first is we're changing the minimum payment from 9% of balance to a more industry normal 5%. Again, slows down the problem, doesn't cure it. The second thing we're doing is we'll begin to market the account unlike other major companies. We've never actually marketed our account. Let's see, this is the most marketing that we do, which is a pay on account or pay now and that's it. We think there are advantages of having an account, whether that be the ability to spread your payments, they try before you buy without incurring interest or the fact that our account customers get priority access to our VIP sale. We think there are things that we can do most of our credit business, and we'll be experimenting with those over the next 6 months. You shouldn't assume that any of them will be successful, but I want you to know that we are trying them, and we will report more fully on that in 6 months time, once we have a feel for what levels of success we're getting with it. In terms of U.K., next-day delivery service, store and Home was 10 p.m. this time last year. In September, we moved the stores back to midnight. We didn't really market that because it was -- it's quite confusing message to say midnight cutoff for stores, 10 p.m. for Home. We've just moved our cutoff for Home back to 11 p.m., and we'll be moving it back to 12 p.m. by August of this year. So by the time we launch the autumn book, we had to have midnight delivery for both stores and Home, which we think is a bit of a game changer for the U.K. market, but not as exciting as you might think because the sales that we take between 8 and 10, 21%, and this is basically -- this is the put your kids to bed, have a bit of supper order close. The 10 p.m. is actually only 9% and this is the go to the part and to get home and order. And we might experience high returns rates on these than we were initially expecting. So I don't think -- I think in terms of sales leverage, the 10 to midnight improvement is not nearly as big as the 8 to 10 leverage, but it is a bit of a game changer. And in terms of marketing service and what people think of it, it's a perception changer. And really, the capabilities of our delivery service that have led us to the LABEL business really, because our aim there is to take our delivery networks and our customer base, our 4 million customer base, and leverage it to sell noncompeting brands, all of which are significantly more expensive than NEXT. And over the last year, we have had a lot of success with this, and we're just beginning to get traction more and more brands. The big battle here is recruiting the brands. The stock is -- all of the stock is available on the next website as a dedicated part of the next website. Some of it, about 50% of it is available in our catalogs, all of it is available on the dedicated LABEL online website and 4 LABEL catalogs that published to coincide with the launch of our spring/summer and autumn/winter ranges. And sales performance has been good. That is the -- we increased sales of around GBP 30 million -- sorry, GBP 21 million the year just gone. We think we'll get further traction, about GBP 40 million sales in the year ahead. In terms of profitability, net margins of the business dropped last year. And part of the reason for that is the planned transition of partner brands from wholesale to commission basis. The wholesale business is a much higher margin for us and therefore good for profitability. But there's an enormous overhead in us sitting down and buying stock off the brands, which may not be appropriate for the customers. Certainly, won't be the best stock. We believe operational commission, which gives them much higher profits and potentially the highest, the most profitable route-to-market working on a commission basis means that we will enable them to select the best product at their risk for the next stretch and certainly on the brands that we switched from wholesale to commission, we have seen a big move forward in sales. We anticipate the profitability on this business before any interest income be around 15%, and that's the target that we are working to for the LABEL business. There is a question as to how much this will affect NEXT sales and certainly when we started the business, we anticipated that there will be some attrition of NEXT sales as a result of selling the stock. The only trial on this would indicate that the issue isn't a great one. We did a trial where we took 100,000 customers whose average sales on NEXT is 315 and who are already ordering around GBP 65 million of the brands through the back end of our book. We then took an identical demographic and sent a LABEL book to them. Unsurprisingly, the people we sent the LABEL catalog too spend much more on brands. Interestingly, the loss on NEXT sales was -- there wasn't a loss on NEXT sales. Actually, NEXT sales moved forward by 3%. Now there is an argument -- and actually , this is a repeat of the experience. There is an argument to say that if you can persuade people to come to your site for any reason that you more likely to pick up sales, my own view is that in the long run, actually, we will see some attrition, but the evidence we've got about attrition will be minimal. I certainly don't think you should assume that so not more NEXT stock as result of having other people's brands on us on our site, but I think the evidence we've got was suggested as not going to be a big problem for us. And, of course, 50% of the orders are subsequently picked up in our stores and so drive retail footfall. \r\nMoving on to Directory overseas. Continued very strong growth in this business, maintained margin of 18%. We anticipate in the year ahead, the growth will not be as strong in the year ahead as it has been, partly because we've now opened in all the countries that we want to open in. And our focus will be on improving our distribution and delivery times. So Germany and France, when we opened service, we ran it for 2 years on a 4- to 5-day delivery time. We looked at the speed at which we picked and packed the stock, how fast we can deliver it to various airports that the stock flies from, we've reduced that lead time now to 1 to 2 days with 80% of our customers in those countries on weekdays getting their stock within 1 day. \r\nSo next-day delivery 4 days of the week for our German customers, about 80% of our German customers. And we have seen significant sales move forward as a result of that improvement. We opened our first hub in Belfast last year. I've told you about that hub and the service improvements we got from it. It has served as a test bed for we can do elsewhere. \r\nWe're opening a hub in Moscow within the next month. Currently, our delivery promise in Russia is 8 to 12 days and returns cost the customer GBP 18, because they have to pay for those returns to be sent back to the U.K. Once we've opened the hub,  I noted [ph] that I should say, we spent GBP 2.5 million on it. There it is in almost GBP 2.5 million worth of glory. We'll have about GBP 0.5 million worth of that is a call center within the building. When we got to open, 60% of our customers will have delivery within 1 or 2 days. Moscow and St. Petersburgh will be next-day and the price of returns, on average, will drop to around GBP 3. Obviously -- and I can tell there's a slight silence in the room, because you're all thinking this is not the best time to be investing in the Russian Federation and you would be absolutely right.  One of the reasons that we're anticipating slower growth in the year ahead is because of the effect that the oil price and troubles we've had on the Russian currency. Currency is down 40%. In order to maintain our profitability, we have to put our ruble prices up by 43%, not enough to cope -- not enough to compensate fully for the drop in currency. Our sales in rubles are still up 45%. So we're still growing the business in ruble terms. However, that's not much consolation, because both prices and sales in pounds terms are down and profitability has halved from 18% to 9%. We're going to press on with this investment, mainly because we've made it all. And we think that if and when the Russian economy stabilizes and the currency stabilizes, we think we have got the basis of building a good business, but it will depend on the political situation but you can see even at the current levels of pricing and profitability, it's not a bad business. \r\nWe opened in China last year. And I was skeptical as to whether we could do well in China at all. Actually, the business has done much better than we thought it was going to do, and it has given us room for encouragement. It's coming in at around 10th or 11th country in our rankings at the moment, and we think we'll grow within that ranking. When we started delivering, it was 21 days. We've recently reduced it to 14-day delivery time. We're investing and we're opening a third-party hub. So we're going to be putting a lot of money into this having to [ph] putting any capital really of any description into the hub. And we aim to have it opened sometime later in the year, and then we think that we can get 60% of our customers within 1 or 2 days once we're opened -- once we go into hub. That hub will also service Taiwan, Hong Kong and Japan. \r\nIn terms of looking at the sales and profit guidance, here is our normal red and green arrows chart, which I won't go through in painful detail. Suffice to say that our full year brand sales are going -- with think it will be up at least 1.5% and 5.5%. Profit before tax at either ends of those levels, we think will be between 0.4% and 6.7%. And obviously, getting some negative and positive leverage over sales either end of the sales ranges. Ordinary dividends taken as a percentage of our average share price at the beginning of the year, which is -- as it happens, 72 33, with 2.1%. Special dividend yield or buybacks, earning and also from buybacks will be 3.3% depending on where the share price settles. At the moment, just to remind you, our target share price our buybacks is 68 27. [ph] That is total shareholder return of EPS growth plus dividends, so somewhere between 5.8% and 12.1%. We think those returns in today's market are not at the bottom end not unacceptable and the top end, very good. But by our historical standards, they are not viewed [ph] as good as we have delivered. You can see this is just a total shareholder returns we delivered over the last 5 years. And I suppose one of the things that I should stress is, first of all, we think our sales estimate are reasonable and definitely reasonable for the first 2 quarters, which are going to be very tough. The second thing is that there is a temptation in all retail business, I guess, to want to push sales harder than they would actually grow. And I want to reassure you that, next we'll not do that. We are setting budgets with very realistic levels. That means that we'll be managing our most important cost, our stock, but also all our other costs in the business at least very conservative levels. And if we do that and we believe we can deliver respectable returns this year, but more importantly, continue to build our business operations in the U.K. whether that be NEXT operations, brandied operations and NEXT operations overseas, we can still -- we can lay the foundations for better growth in the years ahead, which will be our focus for the year ahead. So that is the slightly flat finish to what was otherwise a painless presentation.",

As Chairman, I usually am trying to take a fairly miserable view of the results, but it's quite difficult to take a miserable view of this lot.  \r\nSo the real point about today in -- to me, is that we're now 5 years into the transformation program that we set out when Adam arrived. And this set of results is a very good illustration of the progress that's been made not just in operating performance but also the shape of the group, the clarity of the strategy going forward and, of course, the strength of the balance sheet and cash flows. So it's, in a way, a sort of end of one era and entering a new era.\r\nAdam is going to introduce the results. Ian is going to take us through all the exciting detail, and then Adam will say a few words about the strategy going forward. And there's a very important film that Adam will introduce to entertain you all. At the end of the meeting, we'll take questions, and then there's a number of our -- the executive team here and we're all very happy to chat and have another cup of coffee or whatever you want. Okay, Adam?\n\n---\n\nThanks, Archie. Morning, everyone. Great to see you all here, and thanks for taking the time to join us. As Archie said, we've got a short presentation this morning, plenty of time for questions at the end, but just, as always, to get everyone in the mood because no ITV presentation would ever be complete without one, we're just going to run you a short video just to remind you of all the terrific programs that drove our performance last year and give you a little bit of a look ahead to what's coming over the next few months. So if we could run the video, please. Thank you.\r\n[Presentation]\n\n---\n\nVery good. Top question on the press call this morning was what did I think of Martin Clunes' Scottish accent in Arthur & George? Good to know they've got the priorities right. It's better than mine, by the way.\r\nAnyway, to the results. As you know, I think it's been another year of strong growth for us, and we've made significant progress right across ITV, as Archie said. We continue to rebalance the business, drive new revenue streams and invest in future growth. And if we take a look at the highlights, external revenue, up 8%; within that, advertising revenue, up 6%, versus a market we estimate that was up 4.5%. First half was up 7.2%; second half, up 4.1%. Obviously, we had the Football World Cup in the first half. Non-NAR revenue, up GBP 116 million or 10%, now 45% of our total revenue, and that was driven by ITV Studios revenues being up 9% and our Online, Pay & Interactive revenues up 30%. Strong revenue growth and delivering value from our investments in high-quality content, plus cost reductions of around GBP 15 million, have led to earnings growth at every level across ITV; in Broadcast, profits up 17%; ITV Studios, up 22%; for the group, up 18%; adjusted PBT and adjusted EPS, both up 23%.\r\nAs you can see from the announcement this morning, we've got confidence in the ongoing strength of the business, and we really do see clear opportunities for growth and further investment in the business whilst increasing shareholder returns. And as you know, we have a commitment to at least a 20% per annum growth in the ordinary dividend for 3 years. Actually, the board has proposed a final dividend for 2014 of 3.3p, which equates to a full year ordinary dividend of 4.7p, which is up 34% year-on-year. And we're proposing a special dividend of GBP 250 million or 6.25p per share. And Ian will take through a little bit later in the presentation how that fits into our capital allocation framework.\r\nBy focusing on delivering consistently against a very, very clear strategy, I think we've delivered very strong results over each of the last 5 years. And as we outlined at our half year results in July, as we enter the next stage of our growth plan, we believe the original vision we had for ITV remains as relevant as ever. And there is no change, as you know, in our strategy going forward. However, as you also know and just to remind you, we have evolved our corporate priorities to focus on the 3 key areas of growth as we see them: first of all, to maximize audience and revenue share from both our free-to-air broadcast and our video-on-demand business because video-on-demand viewing will, in the long term, become part of consolidated viewing, and we will take the view that a screen is a screen and a view is a view irrespective of what it's seen on; secondly, to keep growing our international content business to meet the increasing demand from all of these new and multiple platforms; and thirdly, to use our increasing scale of IP ownership and program assets to build a global pay and distribution business over time. And as we continue to rebalance the business and grow new revenue streams, both organically and through acquisition, there will, obviously, be an increasing emphasis on international content creation and distribution. But as always, it's all about execution for us. So how did we do in terms of that last year?\r\nSo firstly, maximize audience share and revenue share from free-to-air broadcast and VOD. Broadcast & Online business continues to perform very strongly. If we look at, first of all, TV more generally, linear viewing was, on average, around 3 hours, 41 minutes per day last year, still very strong -- actually, it's at the same level it was at in 2005. And it's quite interesting, the slight dip last year, when you really look underneath the skin of the numbers, is coming from those people who watch more than 4 hours a day. In other words, it's the very heaviest viewers watching less. And that would tend to fit with more people getting into employment. So we're sort of coming back to viewing levels around the same as pre the recession. What's interesting there is that if you look at that viewing, 98.4% of viewing is done on a television set and around 88% of it live. So it's still in reasonable health. And if you look at those other devices, whilst the growth is very strong, it's worth reminding ourselves that only around 3 minutes, 30 seconds of viewing, on average a day, is on another device, so still relatively small but growing reasonably quickly. Our ability, as you see on the top-right chart there, to deliver unrivaled mass audiences is as strong as ever. And absolutely, it is our key commercial proposition. We delivered 99.4% of all the commercial programs with an audience over 5 million; 95% of all the programs over 3 million. And that has remained consistently strong throughout the last few years, and that's what drives our advertising proposition.\r\nEconomic recovery is driving advertising growth across most categories, as Ian will show you later, and our ability to deliver those mass audiences is driving our growth in share. NAR was up 6%, giving us a share broadcast of 45.9%, which is our strongest outperformance of the market in 5 years, and we absolutely do expect to outperform the market again this year.\r\nThis year, we also launched ITVBe and repositioned ITV2. And if we look at the combined share of those 2 channels in the 40 weeks before the launch and then subsequently, the combined share is up 13% for individuals and 12% for 16 to 34 year old. So the combination of the 2 channels, going forward, seems to be working for us.\r\nAnd clearly, one of the focuses for us is on improving ITV Family share of viewing on-screen, which fell last year by 5%. In other words, we effectively gave up the 4% gain that we had from the previous year despite investing around GBP 35 million more in the schedule last year, which, of course, does remind us it's not just about the amount of money spent. We are making progress in turning that around. The digital channels, if we look at the digital channels' performance, last year in the first half, the digital channels were 10% down. In the second half of the year, they were 2% down, and year-to-date, this year, they're 4% up. So we have gradually turned those around, and we're very focused now on trying to do the same for the main channel. It takes slightly longer there. Because of the type of programs, they take longer to come through the system. But as we look forward to what we've got coming in terms of high-quality drama and sport, I think we can do so with some confidence, but we remain very focused on that.\r\nOnline viewing continues to grow strongly. As I said earlier, our online viewing was up 26% year-on-year, driven by a number of different things. ITV Player app downloads were up 41% to 16.5 million; improved distribution, we're now on 20 platforms. And we very much support the key connected TV platforms that really make our content prominent. We've got Freeview connected to come later this year, but if we look at the performance of YouView, for example, it's now in around 1.8 million homes versus 1 million at the end of last year. And our viewing requests on YouView are up 80% -- 88% year-on-year, so again, a very fast-growing platform for us; all of which, by the way, is helping us to build a database which will be of great use to us in the future. We now have 8 million registered users, and that's up about 129% year-on-year.\r\nSo in summary, Broadcast & Online business continues to perform well. Profit is up fivefold, as you can see, bottom right there, over the last 5 years and up 17% year-on-year and, we believe, very much set for future growth.\r\nThe Studios business, growing our international content business, it's a second key priority. And ITV Studios have delivered another strong year of revenue and profit growth, driven primarily last year by acquisitions and with margins improving from 16% to 17%. If we look at the U.K., first of all, ITV Studios last year had around 60% of network commissions versus 59% the previous year and versus 50% in 2009; healthy pipeline last year of new commissions, 149 new commissions versus 121 the previous year; and 13% growth in what we call off-ITV, 13% growth for programs we produce for other broadcasters in the U.K.; but total revenue in the U.K. only up 1% due to the network spend on the World Cup and, therefore, reduced spend on original programming.\r\nIn the international side, we're investing there, 3 further acquisitions in Leftfield, DiGa and United, which is an indep based in Denmark. The U.S. business is now the largest unscripted indie in the U.S., and we're working with 45 networks in America. We have 141 programs on air in the States.\r\nThrough its strong growth over the last 5 years, ITV Studios, I think, is becoming a well-established global business of scale. Almost half of its revenue generated was outside the U.K., now at around 47% of the total. And we had 24% growth in international revenue in 2014 alone. And I think we are now fit to compete in a global market that's worth around $50 billion and growing at a rate of around 5% to 6% per annum.\r\nThe key areas for us are future growth and investment for ITV Studios are, first of all, building a global scripted business, and that's very much got a U.K. and a U.S. focus. ITV Studios have 12 new dramas airing this year. In the U.K., those include Jekyll & Hyde, Home Fires, Raised by Wolves, The Trials of Jimmy Rose. And in the U.S., they include Aquarius, Texas Rising and The Good Witch, and we also have the animated drama Thunderbirds Are Go relaunching in the spring. And all of those will impact in 2015 and '16.\r\nThe second key area of focus for ITV Studios is in creating more formats that travel internationally. We currently have 36 formats at ITVS that were sold internationally, 12 of them in 3 or more countries. Ones that continue to do well, like Come Dine With Me, Hell's Kitchen and The Chase, and big new commissions, which include Saturday Night Takeaway in the U.S. for NBC, which we're also now doing in France; and I'm a Celebrity for Australian TV, which naturally enough, we're filming in South Africa. So Studios business, in good shape and, as you can see, has done extremely well over the last 5 years.\r\nTo meet that global demand, I thought it was worth just highlighting where we are on ITV Studios. To meet that global demand for high-quality content and to continue to deliver growth, we use what we describe as a mixed economy model. And it's very much focused on the key creative markets. We have acquisitions, as you know, like Leftfield in the U.S. and The Garden and Big Talk in the U.K. We have associate companies, such as Tomorrow Studios, which is a JV with Marty Adelstein in the U.S., which has produced Aquarius for us; and Mammoth Screen in the U.K., where -- for the network, they're doing 2 dramas, Black Work and Endeavour, and also Poldark for the BBC. We have existing ITV brands, both the labels themselves and key formats and dramas. We're making scripted investments in the U.S. and internationally, and Ian will take you through the cash implications of how that works a little bit later. And we have talent and POD deals with people like Glenn Hugill and his company, Possessed. And the objective there is to combine an overall scale of operation whilst keeping the creative and entrepreneurial drive and ambition in each of the labels. We're looking for the combination of those 2 things. We want to be a magnet for the best creative talent in the industry, and I think we are fast becoming that. And then we support that with very tight management grip on one side and with international distribution on the other. So that's how we fit all of that together.\r\nWe're also now investing in digital content companies, which focus primarily on the younger end of the market. So we have Zealot, where we've taken a stake, which is funded by Danny Zappin. For those who don't know, he's the founder of Maker Studios, and that's all about content creation for YouTube, Instagram, Vine and SoundCloud. We've got Indigenous Media, where we have a stake, which is run by Jon Avnet and Rodrigo Garcia based in Hollywood. They're very much focused on short-form scripted. And then we have a stake in a company called Believe Entertainment, which is about short-form digital content for major brands using A-list talent to reach key demographics, so just starting to experiment with those things now.\r\nBuilding a global pay and distribution business. Our Online, Pay & Interactive business continues to grow very strongly. Revenue has tripled over the last 5 years and up 30% year-on-year and, as Ian will show you later, delivering a very high-margin return. Driving this performance was, of course, a number of different things: the launch of Encore, which was profitable from day 1 but, remember, has only a half year effect because we only run -- launched it in June; and a new wider 4-year deal with Sky, which covers all their various platforms, including Go and Now, and certainly improved our video-on-demand viewing on the Sky platform by 113% year-on-year.\r\nWe're exploring new models for content creation and distribution. The digital ones -- investments, I mentioned earlier. We've got Cirkus, our Scandinavian SVOD aggregator platform, which is expanding in that area of the world. We've launched 12 short-form channels on YouTube, and the plan is to have launched 22 by the end of this year. And to date, what's interesting is of the 35 million views on those channels, 63% is 18 to 34. So we are attracting the kind of people into those that we wanted to.\r\nAnd as the third-largest European distributor of content, we're looking to build on last year's 7% growth in revenue for GE through formats and finished tapes, and we're building our acquired third-party rights business with titles such as Poldark, as we mentioned, in the U.K.; Schitt's Creek in Canada -- got to watch how you say that one; and Jordskott from Sweden. So again, that business is starting to grow now. With the new dramas coming through the system, obviously, that will impact very positively on GE.\r\nSo in conclusion, before passing on to Ian, as I hope you can see, executing our strategy and being very focused on it has delivered, I think, excellent results over the last 5 years. The performance has improved significantly in every part of the business, despite the fact that we've done it in a period with very difficult economic conditions, increased competition and a fairly fast-changing technological environment as well. And I think as we enter the next phase, ITV is now a high-growth business with increasing emphasis on international content creation and distribution. I think it's demonstrably stronger and more robust as a business, and I think it's demonstrably stronger creatively and financially. So I think we're in good shape to face the future with some optimism.\r\nSo I'd like to pass you over to Ian, who is now going to take you through the financial results in a bit more detail. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to leave the previous slide up a bit longer, but we need to get through this.\r\nAs Adam said, against all the key financial measures, we've had a strong year: good revenue growth across the business, 18% EBITA growth, a 2% margin improvement, EPS up 23% and strong cash flows underpinning the strategy. The progress we've made and the confidence we have in the outlook mean we have proposed to increase the ordinary dividend by 34% to 4.7p and, in addition, return GBP 250 million to shareholders by way of a special dividend. More on this later.\r\nLooking at revenue. We have total revenues of just under GBP 3 billion, up 7%, with both businesses delivering good growth. 7% is just over GBP 200 million of new revenue. GBP 87 million of this is NAR, spot advertising, which continued to deliver good growth even after the Football World Cup. Studios delivered GBP 98 million of revenue growth before currency. This is mainly from the acquired businesses, and we had GBP 35 million of growth from Online, Pay & Interactive, which is now making a material contribution to revenue and profits. The group continues to rebalance away from U.K. spot advertising, and 45% of our revenues are now non-NAR.  \r\nIn profit terms, we delivered over GBP 100 million of year-on-year growth, up 18% to GBP 730 million. On the back of the good revenue performance, both businesses delivered strong profit growth, Broadcast, up 17%; and Studios, up 22%. Margins in both businesses increased, and the group margin is up 2% to 28%. Studios benefited from a change in revenue mix, cost savings and 6 months of the higher-margin Leftfield business. In Broadcast, advertising has always been operationally geared. Every GBP 1 increase in revenue is GBP 1 of extra profit and cash, but the new revenue streams of online and pay are also high margin. The GBP 35 million of new revenue has led to GBP 33 million of incremental profit before additional content cost. We've remained focused on overheads, and the GBP 15 million of savings has, again, funded our investment in the creative pipeline and new channel launches.\r\nFinancially, Broadcast had a really strong year. For the first time, the business delivered over GBP 2 billion of revenue, up GBP 127 million year-on-year. And as these are high-margin revenues, profits have increased by GBP 81 million, up 17%, with margins increasing 2% to 28%. ITV Family NAR is up 6%, ahead of our estimate of the TV ad market, which we think is up around 4.5%. This means our share of Broadcast spot revenue is 45.9%, a gain of 0.5 percentage points, our largest gain over the last 5 years. And as you can see, online and pay revenues grew strongly, up 30% or GBP 35 million. We continue to invest in the business. The schedule costs have increased to include the World Cup and content for our new channels, and our other costs include the launch and marketing investment for Be and Encore.\r\nThe GBP 1 billion investment we make in Broadcast content is increasingly driving value to other parts of the business. Over half of this budget is original commissions to the main channel, many drama and entertainment. It's this content that's watched across the various VOD platforms through ITV Player, and it's also this content that's on our HD channels at Encore, for which we get paid by the platform operators. VOD requests, driven by mobile and connected TVs, were up 26%, and this created the advertising capacity for us to grow our online revenues by GBP 11 million. Pay revenues were up GBP 20 million, on the back of improved deals with Sky and Virgin plus 6 months of ITV Encore. Our investment in content will increase by around GBP 20 million in 2015 to support a full year of the new channels. There will also be more drama in the budget, which not only helps these new revenues but creates opportunities for ITV Studios.\r\nLooking at advertising. And as we said at the half year, we've seen strong growth from retail, food, finance, entertainment and leisure, the largest advertising categories. And as expected, male-orientated spend, particularly gaming, financials and autos, performed strongly around the football. Other than a brief pause over the summer, the growth was consistent over the second half, and we saw 4% growth in both Q3 and Q4. 2015 has started strongly, and it's reassuring that the growth continues to come from the key categories. However, we do expect the shape of this year to be very different, with peaks in spend happening now and around the rugby in September. The post-Easter and summer months could be relatively quiet.  Having said that, the fact that all key categories are continuing to spend is encouraging for our full year outlook.\r\nITV Studios delivered 9% growth in total revenue, GBP 98 million at constant currency. As the business becomes more global, we become less reliant on the U.K. market and more exposed to faster-growing international and distribution businesses. This also means more exposure to currency translation movements, and these results would have shown GBP 22 million more revenue and GBP 5 million more profit if rates had remained unchanged to the prior year. Organic revenues grew 1%, mainly the international business, with the U.K. largely flat, a result of lower ITV spend. However, as Adam said, we did secure an increased share of the slightly reduced commission budget. The headline growth is from acquisitions coming through as planned, primarily Leftfield. The margins have increased as a result of the acquired businesses, cost savings and some changes in our revenue mix. We've had a good year in formats and finished tape sales, as can be seen in the GE numbers. Plus, remaking The Chase, Takeaway and I'm a Celebrity in more territories has all helped the margin.\r\nAs Adam said, one of our key priorities is building a scale scripted business. This year, we invested around GBP 50 million in funding dramas, such as Jekyll & Hyde in the U.K. and Texas Rising, The Good Witch and Aquarius in the U.S., all sold straight to series and all with good international distribution potential. This slide is illustrative only, and what we're trying to do is show the economics on an example project. The deficit is a difference between our cash invested to produce a new series and what the host commissioner will pay to broadcast. The deficit gets covered by sales to other international broadcasters or platforms. We know we make more money from a successful returning series that we own, such as a Selfridge, a Lewis or a Vera, than we do from an indie drama, such as Broadchurch, though history shows that some of these projects may not work, which means the returns are increasingly recognized over time as dramas prove their success. This means that we'll need a portfolio series to balance the risk. So we'll continue to invest in these dramas so that strong cash flows and margins of returning series will support the investment needed to fund the pipeline of new projects. In 2015, we'll start to see the revenues coming through from our initial scripted investments, plus we have the launch of Thunderbirds and a full year of Leftfield, all of which means that we expect to deliver a revenue growth of around GBP 100 million similar to 2014, with a better mix between organic and acquired.\r\nBack to the numbers. And these results are strong all the way down the P&L: 18% growth in EBITA, 23% growth in pretax profit, 23% growth in adjusted EPS. Financing costs are down following the redemption of the convertible and the buyback of the remaining 2019 debt. The effective tax rate is in line with our original guidance of 21% and should stay at around this level for the next couple of years. In the future, cash tax will be more in line with the P&L charge. Our statutory EPS is up 40% as the prior year included the one-off costs of various bond buybacks, and the number of shares used for these calculations has increased by 2% following the redemption of the convertible. And our usual planning guide for 2015 modeling is included in the additional information in the back of the pack.\r\nOne of our key financial strengths and areas of focus remains our cash generation. Profit to cash conversion is 91%, lower than last year because of the GBP 47 million invested in scripted projects. This is evidenced in the working capital buildup and, as discussed, represents a good use of the cash, and we're planning for further investment in 2015. Adjusted free cash flow before M&A and dividends is up 10% to GBP 478 million. This strong cash flow has funded GBP 313 million of dividends we paid to shareholders and GBP 214 million of acquisitions, primarily Leftfield. This tight working capital management and strong underlying cash flow means that even after over GBP 500 million of dividends and acquisitions, we've ended the year with a positive net cash position.\r\nAnd it's our confidence in the ongoing cash generation of the business and potential for future growth that's enabled us to give more clarity on our capital structure and dividends. At the interims, we said the ordinary dividend would rise by at least 20% a year from 2014 to 2016, with a view to achieving a level of cover of between 2 and 2.5x. In line with this policy, the strong growth in our EPS means it's appropriate to increase the full year dividend ahead of our previous guidance. Therefore, we're proposing a final dividend of 3.3p, giving a full year of 4.7p, up 34%. We also recognize the importance of capital discipline and running an efficient balance sheet. However, because we continue to see plenty of opportunities for growth, we need flexibility to invest. With strong cash flows, a positive growth outlook and a more balanced business, now is the time for us to gradually increase our leverage. Up to around 1.5x net debt-to-EBITDA will optimize our cost of capital, allow us to maintain our progressive dividend policy and retain the flexibility to continue to invest. A special dividend, returning GBP 250 million to shareholders, reflects this confidence in our cash flow, as in line with this policy.\r\nPulling everything together, we've had another strong year, and the outlook into 2015 is positive across all parts of the business. Our approach to balance sheet and shareholder returns reflects the progress we've made, whilst at the same time, we still see plenty opportunities for further growth. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Ian. Just a couple of minutes more and then we'll move to Q&A. I just want to, very quickly, remind you of the key strategic opportunities for growth that we have and where our focus will be this year and then give you a bit of a view on the outlook for this year at the same time.\r\nFirst of all, on the opportunities for growth. We outlined these at the half year. They haven't changed, but I just want to handpick out 1 or 2. In the first column, clearly, as we've said, economic recovery is driving growth in the ad market. We will be very focused on maintaining our unique scale and ability to deliver those audiences and growing our share of the total TV and VOD advertising market, a lot of focus going into that.\r\nIn the content side, we continue to work on developing and creating high-quality IP, absolute emphasis on formats, international formats that travel and also using our strong cash flows to produce high-quality, high-profile dramas straight to series and, over time, to build that portfolio. And if you remember, we said we were looking to do around 6 to 10 scripted projects per annum. This year, we'll have 12. So we're performing a bit ahead of where we expected to be. And obviously, within that, as with any creative company, we've got to continue to attract and retain great, greater talent to generate those more hits and to continue to look at acquisitions in line with that strategy and in line with that focus that we've outlined.\r\nThird area, develop -- the key things for us there are to develop new pay services and channels using the increased IP that we have, and we're looking at how we can take those forward, not just in the U.K. but internationally as well. Of course, we've mentioned it before: secure retransmission fees in the medium term. I think everyone is aware there are reviews now up and running by both the government and Ofcom looking at this, and those will, no doubt, ramp up post the election. And we want to continue to scale our international distribution business. So that's where we're going to be concentrating our efforts this year.\r\nFinal slide, just looking to the outlook for the year. In summary, as Ian said, a very strong set of 2014 results means we're entering 2015 in good shape and with really positive momentum. The ad market recovering; NAR, we expect to be up 11% in quarter 1 and 4% to 7% in April. For those who like the detail, that means January was up around 14%; February, 13%. March looks like being around 8% up. Quarter 1 last year was up 2%, so clearly, much stronger growth there. As Ian said, the growth continues to be across most sectors. If you look at the start to this year, as opposed to the numbers Ian showed, retail is up 19%; finance, up 13%; food, up 10%; telecoms, up 32%. It should probably reflect where a lot of activity is -- cars, up 15%. But it will be a different shape. Easter, although it falls in April, it's right at the beginning, and really, the advertising spend, by and large, is in March. And actually, that's quite interesting. Easter last -- April last year was up 19% with Easter, and it's still up 4% to 7% without Easter. So I think that's a sign that the market is reasonably positive, but it will be a different market. I think if you look to last year, there was a bit of a pause when the devolution bill was going through in Scotland, a very short pause. I suspect there might be something similar in May with the general election, and then you've got the absolute shift from the Football World Cup not being there in June versus the Rugby World Cup being there in September and October; so no doubt, a slightly different shape, but generally a positive market, and we do expect to outperform that market. Online, Pay & Interactive revenue, I think we can see, will continue to grow strongly. And as Ian said, I think in Studios, we again expect to deliver around GBP 100 million of revenue growth on a constant currency basis with a return to good organic growth within that; keep and maintain a robust, efficient and flexible balance sheet. And we can see clear opportunities, as I think we've outlined, to invest in further growth whilst increasing shareholder returns at the same time.\r\nAnd overall, I think, as you can probably see, we expect another good performance in 2015. So thank you very much for taking the time to listen, and we're very happy to answer any questions that you have. Thank you very much, indeed.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Archie Norman (Executives)】\nRight. Good morning, everybody. Great to see you all. As Chairman, I usually am trying to take a fairly miserable view of the results, but it's quite difficult to take a miserable view of this lot.  \r\nSo the real point about today in -- to me, is that we're now 5 years into the transformation program that we set out when Adam arrived. And this set of results is a very good illustration of the progress that's been made not just in operating performance but also the shape of the group, the clarity of the strategy going forward and, of course, the strength of the balance sheet and cash flows. So it's, in a way, a sort of end of one era and entering a new era.\r\nAdam is going to introduce the results. Ian is going to take us through all the exciting detail, and then Adam will say a few words about the strategy going forward. And there's a very important film that Adam will introduce to entertain you all. At the end of the meeting, we'll take questions, and then there's a number of our -- the executive team here and we're all very happy to chat and have another cup of coffee or whatever you want. Okay, Adam?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Adam Crozier (Executives)】\nThanks, Archie. Morning, everyone. Great to see you all here, and thanks for taking the time to join us. As Archie said, we've got a short presentation this morning, plenty of time for questions at the end, but just, as always, to get everyone in the mood because no ITV presentation would ever be complete without one, we're just going to run you a short video just to remind you of all the terrific programs that drove our performance last year and give you a little bit of a look ahead to what's coming over the next few months. So if we could run the video, please. Thank you.\r\n[Presentation]\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Adam Crozier (Executives)】\nVery good. Top question on the press call this morning was what did I think of Martin Clunes' Scottish accent in Arthur & George? Good to know they've got the priorities right. It's better than mine, by the way.\r\nAnyway, to the results. As you know, I think it's been another year of strong growth for us, and we've made significant progress right across ITV, as Archie said. We continue to rebalance the business, drive new revenue streams and invest in future growth. And if we take a look at the highlights, external revenue, up 8%; within that, advertising revenue, up 6%, versus a market we estimate that was up 4.5%. First half was up 7.2%; second half, up 4.1%. Obviously, we had the Football World Cup in the first half. Non-NAR revenue, up GBP 116 million or 10%, now 45% of our total revenue, and that was driven by ITV Studios revenues being up 9% and our Online, Pay & Interactive revenues up 30%. Strong revenue growth and delivering value from our investments in high-quality content, plus cost reductions of around GBP 15 million, have led to earnings growth at every level across ITV; in Broadcast, profits up 17%; ITV Studios, up 22%; for the group, up 18%; adjusted PBT and adjusted EPS, both up 23%.\r\nAs you can see from the announcement this morning, we've got confidence in the ongoing strength of the business, and we really do see clear opportunities for growth and further investment in the business whilst increasing shareholder returns. And as you know, we have a commitment to at least a 20% per annum growth in the ordinary dividend for 3 years. Actually, the board has proposed a final dividend for 2014 of 3.3p, which equates to a full year ordinary dividend of 4.7p, which is up 34% year-on-year. And we're proposing a special dividend of GBP 250 million or 6.25p per share. And Ian will take through a little bit later in the presentation how that fits into our capital allocation framework.\r\nBy focusing on delivering consistently against a very, very clear strategy, I think we've delivered very strong results over each of the last 5 years. And as we outlined at our half year results in July, as we enter the next stage of our growth plan, we believe the original vision we had for ITV remains as relevant as ever. And there is no change, as you know, in our strategy going forward. However, as you also know and just to remind you, we have evolved our corporate priorities to focus on the 3 key areas of growth as we see them: first of all, to maximize audience and revenue share from both our free-to-air broadcast and our video-on-demand business because video-on-demand viewing will, in the long term, become part of consolidated viewing, and we will take the view that a screen is a screen and a view is a view irrespective of what it's seen on; secondly, to keep growing our international content business to meet the increasing demand from all of these new and multiple platforms; and thirdly, to use our increasing scale of IP ownership and program assets to build a global pay and distribution business over time. And as we continue to rebalance the business and grow new revenue streams, both organically and through acquisition, there will, obviously, be an increasing emphasis on international content creation and distribution. But as always, it's all about execution for us. So how did we do in terms of that last year?\r\nSo firstly, maximize audience share and revenue share from free-to-air broadcast and VOD. Broadcast & Online business continues to perform very strongly. If we look at, first of all, TV more generally, linear viewing was, on average, around 3 hours, 41 minutes per day last year, still very strong -- actually, it's at the same level it was at in 2005. And it's quite interesting, the slight dip last year, when you really look underneath the skin of the numbers, is coming from those people who watch more than 4 hours a day. In other words, it's the very heaviest viewers watching less. And that would tend to fit with more people getting into employment. So we're sort of coming back to viewing levels around the same as pre the recession. What's interesting there is that if you look at that viewing, 98.4% of viewing is done on a television set and around 88% of it live. So it's still in reasonable health. And if you look at those other devices, whilst the growth is very strong, it's worth reminding ourselves that only around 3 minutes, 30 seconds of viewing, on average a day, is on another device, so still relatively small but growing reasonably quickly. Our ability, as you see on the top-right chart there, to deliver unrivaled mass audiences is as strong as ever. And absolutely, it is our key commercial proposition. We delivered 99.4% of all the commercial programs with an audience over 5 million; 95% of all the programs over 3 million. And that has remained consistently strong throughout the last few years, and that's what drives our advertising proposition.\r\nEconomic recovery is driving advertising growth across most categories, as Ian will show you later, and our ability to deliver those mass audiences is driving our growth in share. NAR was up 6%, giving us a share broadcast of 45.9%, which is our strongest outperformance of the market in 5 years, and we absolutely do expect to outperform the market again this year.\r\nThis year, we also launched ITVBe and repositioned ITV2. And if we look at the combined share of those 2 channels in the 40 weeks before the launch and then subsequently, the combined share is up 13% for individuals and 12% for 16 to 34 year old. So the combination of the 2 channels, going forward, seems to be working for us.\r\nAnd clearly, one of the focuses for us is on improving ITV Family share of viewing on-screen, which fell last year by 5%. In other words, we effectively gave up the 4% gain that we had from the previous year despite investing around GBP 35 million more in the schedule last year, which, of course, does remind us it's not just about the amount of money spent. We are making progress in turning that around. The digital channels, if we look at the digital channels' performance, last year in the first half, the digital channels were 10% down. In the second half of the year, they were 2% down, and year-to-date, this year, they're 4% up. So we have gradually turned those around, and we're very focused now on trying to do the same for the main channel. It takes slightly longer there. Because of the type of programs, they take longer to come through the system. But as we look forward to what we've got coming in terms of high-quality drama and sport, I think we can do so with some confidence, but we remain very focused on that.\r\nOnline viewing continues to grow strongly. As I said earlier, our online viewing was up 26% year-on-year, driven by a number of different things. ITV Player app downloads were up 41% to 16.5 million; improved distribution, we're now on 20 platforms. And we very much support the key connected TV platforms that really make our content prominent. We've got Freeview connected to come later this year, but if we look at the performance of YouView, for example, it's now in around 1.8 million homes versus 1 million at the end of last year. And our viewing requests on YouView are up 80% -- 88% year-on-year, so again, a very fast-growing platform for us; all of which, by the way, is helping us to build a database which will be of great use to us in the future. We now have 8 million registered users, and that's up about 129% year-on-year.\r\nSo in summary, Broadcast & Online business continues to perform well. Profit is up fivefold, as you can see, bottom right there, over the last 5 years and up 17% year-on-year and, we believe, very much set for future growth.\r\nThe Studios business, growing our international content business, it's a second key priority. And ITV Studios have delivered another strong year of revenue and profit growth, driven primarily last year by acquisitions and with margins improving from 16% to 17%. If we look at the U.K., first of all, ITV Studios last year had around 60% of network commissions versus 59% the previous year and versus 50% in 2009; healthy pipeline last year of new commissions, 149 new commissions versus 121 the previous year; and 13% growth in what we call off-ITV, 13% growth for programs we produce for other broadcasters in the U.K.; but total revenue in the U.K. only up 1% due to the network spend on the World Cup and, therefore, reduced spend on original programming.\r\nIn the international side, we're investing there, 3 further acquisitions in Leftfield, DiGa and United, which is an indep based in Denmark. The U.S. business is now the largest unscripted indie in the U.S., and we're working with 45 networks in America. We have 141 programs on air in the States.\r\nThrough its strong growth over the last 5 years, ITV Studios, I think, is becoming a well-established global business of scale. Almost half of its revenue generated was outside the U.K., now at around 47% of the total. And we had 24% growth in international revenue in 2014 alone. And I think we are now fit to compete in a global market that's worth around $50 billion and growing at a rate of around 5% to 6% per annum.\r\nThe key areas for us are future growth and investment for ITV Studios are, first of all, building a global scripted business, and that's very much got a U.K. and a U.S. focus. ITV Studios have 12 new dramas airing this year. In the U.K., those include Jekyll & Hyde, Home Fires, Raised by Wolves, The Trials of Jimmy Rose. And in the U.S., they include Aquarius, Texas Rising and The Good Witch, and we also have the animated drama Thunderbirds Are Go relaunching in the spring. And all of those will impact in 2015 and '16.\r\nThe second key area of focus for ITV Studios is in creating more formats that travel internationally. We currently have 36 formats at ITVS that were sold internationally, 12 of them in 3 or more countries. Ones that continue to do well, like Come Dine With Me, Hell's Kitchen and The Chase, and big new commissions, which include Saturday Night Takeaway in the U.S. for NBC, which we're also now doing in France; and I'm a Celebrity for Australian TV, which naturally enough, we're filming in South Africa. So Studios business, in good shape and, as you can see, has done extremely well over the last 5 years.\r\nTo meet that global demand, I thought it was worth just highlighting where we are on ITV Studios. To meet that global demand for high-quality content and to continue to deliver growth, we use what we describe as a mixed economy model. And it's very much focused on the key creative markets. We have acquisitions, as you know, like Leftfield in the U.S. and The Garden and Big Talk in the U.K. We have associate companies, such as Tomorrow Studios, which is a JV with Marty Adelstein in the U.S., which has produced Aquarius for us; and Mammoth Screen in the U.K., where -- for the network, they're doing 2 dramas, Black Work and Endeavour, and also Poldark for the BBC. We have existing ITV brands, both the labels themselves and key formats and dramas. We're making scripted investments in the U.S. and internationally, and Ian will take you through the cash implications of how that works a little bit later. And we have talent and POD deals with people like Glenn Hugill and his company, Possessed. And the objective there is to combine an overall scale of operation whilst keeping the creative and entrepreneurial drive and ambition in each of the labels. We're looking for the combination of those 2 things. We want to be a magnet for the best creative talent in the industry, and I think we are fast becoming that. And then we support that with very tight management grip on one side and with international distribution on the other. So that's how we fit all of that together.\r\nWe're also now investing in digital content companies, which focus primarily on the younger end of the market. So we have Zealot, where we've taken a stake, which is funded by Danny Zappin. For those who don't know, he's the founder of Maker Studios, and that's all about content creation for YouTube, Instagram, Vine and SoundCloud. We've got Indigenous Media, where we have a stake, which is run by Jon Avnet and Rodrigo Garcia based in Hollywood. They're very much focused on short-form scripted. And then we have a stake in a company called Believe Entertainment, which is about short-form digital content for major brands using A-list talent to reach key demographics, so just starting to experiment with those things now.\r\nBuilding a global pay and distribution business. Our Online, Pay & Interactive business continues to grow very strongly. Revenue has tripled over the last 5 years and up 30% year-on-year and, as Ian will show you later, delivering a very high-margin return. Driving this performance was, of course, a number of different things: the launch of Encore, which was profitable from day 1 but, remember, has only a half year effect because we only run -- launched it in June; and a new wider 4-year deal with Sky, which covers all their various platforms, including Go and Now, and certainly improved our video-on-demand viewing on the Sky platform by 113% year-on-year.\r\nWe're exploring new models for content creation and distribution. The digital ones -- investments, I mentioned earlier. We've got Cirkus, our Scandinavian SVOD aggregator platform, which is expanding in that area of the world. We've launched 12 short-form channels on YouTube, and the plan is to have launched 22 by the end of this year. And to date, what's interesting is of the 35 million views on those channels, 63% is 18 to 34. So we are attracting the kind of people into those that we wanted to.\r\nAnd as the third-largest European distributor of content, we're looking to build on last year's 7% growth in revenue for GE through formats and finished tapes, and we're building our acquired third-party rights business with titles such as Poldark, as we mentioned, in the U.K.; Schitt's Creek in Canada -- got to watch how you say that one; and Jordskott from Sweden. So again, that business is starting to grow now. With the new dramas coming through the system, obviously, that will impact very positively on GE.\r\nSo in conclusion, before passing on to Ian, as I hope you can see, executing our strategy and being very focused on it has delivered, I think, excellent results over the last 5 years. The performance has improved significantly in every part of the business, despite the fact that we've done it in a period with very difficult economic conditions, increased competition and a fairly fast-changing technological environment as well. And I think as we enter the next phase, ITV is now a high-growth business with increasing emphasis on international content creation and distribution. I think it's demonstrably stronger and more robust as a business, and I think it's demonstrably stronger creatively and financially. So I think we're in good shape to face the future with some optimism.\r\nSo I'd like to pass you over to Ian, who is now going to take you through the financial results in a bit more detail. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Ian Griffiths (Executives)】\nThanks. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to leave the previous slide up a bit longer, but we need to get through this.\r\nAs Adam said, against all the key financial measures, we've had a strong year: good revenue growth across the business, 18% EBITA growth, a 2% margin improvement, EPS up 23% and strong cash flows underpinning the strategy. The progress we've made and the confidence we have in the outlook mean we have proposed to increase the ordinary dividend by 34% to 4.7p and, in addition, return GBP 250 million to shareholders by way of a special dividend. More on this later.\r\nLooking at revenue. We have total revenues of just under GBP 3 billion, up 7%, with both businesses delivering good growth. 7% is just over GBP 200 million of new revenue. GBP 87 million of this is NAR, spot advertising, which continued to deliver good growth even after the Football World Cup. Studios delivered GBP 98 million of revenue growth before currency. This is mainly from the acquired businesses, and we had GBP 35 million of growth from Online, Pay & Interactive, which is now making a material contribution to revenue and profits. The group continues to rebalance away from U.K. spot advertising, and 45% of our revenues are now non-NAR.  \r\nIn profit terms, we delivered over GBP 100 million of year-on-year growth, up 18% to GBP 730 million. On the back of the good revenue performance, both businesses delivered strong profit growth, Broadcast, up 17%; and Studios, up 22%. Margins in both businesses increased, and the group margin is up 2% to 28%. Studios benefited from a change in revenue mix, cost savings and 6 months of the higher-margin Leftfield business. In Broadcast, advertising has always been operationally geared. Every GBP 1 increase in revenue is GBP 1 of extra profit and cash, but the new revenue streams of online and pay are also high margin. The GBP 35 million of new revenue has led to GBP 33 million of incremental profit before additional content cost. We've remained focused on overheads, and the GBP 15 million of savings has, again, funded our investment in the creative pipeline and new channel launches.\r\nFinancially, Broadcast had a really strong year. For the first time, the business delivered over GBP 2 billion of revenue, up GBP 127 million year-on-year. And as these are high-margin revenues, profits have increased by GBP 81 million, up 17%, with margins increasing 2% to 28%. ITV Family NAR is up 6%, ahead of our estimate of the TV ad market, which we think is up around 4.5%. This means our share of Broadcast spot revenue is 45.9%, a gain of 0.5 percentage points, our largest gain over the last 5 years. And as you can see, online and pay revenues grew strongly, up 30% or GBP 35 million. We continue to invest in the business. The schedule costs have increased to include the World Cup and content for our new channels, and our other costs include the launch and marketing investment for Be and Encore.\r\nThe GBP 1 billion investment we make in Broadcast content is increasingly driving value to other parts of the business. Over half of this budget is original commissions to the main channel, many drama and entertainment. It's this content that's watched across the various VOD platforms through ITV Player, and it's also this content that's on our HD channels at Encore, for which we get paid by the platform operators. VOD requests, driven by mobile and connected TVs, were up 26%, and this created the advertising capacity for us to grow our online revenues by GBP 11 million. Pay revenues were up GBP 20 million, on the back of improved deals with Sky and Virgin plus 6 months of ITV Encore. Our investment in content will increase by around GBP 20 million in 2015 to support a full year of the new channels. There will also be more drama in the budget, which not only helps these new revenues but creates opportunities for ITV Studios.\r\nLooking at advertising. And as we said at the half year, we've seen strong growth from retail, food, finance, entertainment and leisure, the largest advertising categories. And as expected, male-orientated spend, particularly gaming, financials and autos, performed strongly around the football. Other than a brief pause over the summer, the growth was consistent over the second half, and we saw 4% growth in both Q3 and Q4. 2015 has started strongly, and it's reassuring that the growth continues to come from the key categories. However, we do expect the shape of this year to be very different, with peaks in spend happening now and around the rugby in September. The post-Easter and summer months could be relatively quiet.  Having said that, the fact that all key categories are continuing to spend is encouraging for our full year outlook.\r\nITV Studios delivered 9% growth in total revenue, GBP 98 million at constant currency. As the business becomes more global, we become less reliant on the U.K. market and more exposed to faster-growing international and distribution businesses. This also means more exposure to currency translation movements, and these results would have shown GBP 22 million more revenue and GBP 5 million more profit if rates had remained unchanged to the prior year. Organic revenues grew 1%, mainly the international business, with the U.K. largely flat, a result of lower ITV spend. However, as Adam said, we did secure an increased share of the slightly reduced commission budget. The headline growth is from acquisitions coming through as planned, primarily Leftfield. The margins have increased as a result of the acquired businesses, cost savings and some changes in our revenue mix. We've had a good year in formats and finished tape sales, as can be seen in the GE numbers. Plus, remaking The Chase, Takeaway and I'm a Celebrity in more territories has all helped the margin.\r\nAs Adam said, one of our key priorities is building a scale scripted business. This year, we invested around GBP 50 million in funding dramas, such as Jekyll & Hyde in the U.K. and Texas Rising, The Good Witch and Aquarius in the U.S., all sold straight to series and all with good international distribution potential. This slide is illustrative only, and what we're trying to do is show the economics on an example project. The deficit is a difference between our cash invested to produce a new series and what the host commissioner will pay to broadcast. The deficit gets covered by sales to other international broadcasters or platforms. We know we make more money from a successful returning series that we own, such as a Selfridge, a Lewis or a Vera, than we do from an indie drama, such as Broadchurch, though history shows that some of these projects may not work, which means the returns are increasingly recognized over time as dramas prove their success. This means that we'll need a portfolio series to balance the risk. So we'll continue to invest in these dramas so that strong cash flows and margins of returning series will support the investment needed to fund the pipeline of new projects. In 2015, we'll start to see the revenues coming through from our initial scripted investments, plus we have the launch of Thunderbirds and a full year of Leftfield, all of which means that we expect to deliver a revenue growth of around GBP 100 million similar to 2014, with a better mix between organic and acquired.\r\nBack to the numbers. And these results are strong all the way down the P&L: 18% growth in EBITA, 23% growth in pretax profit, 23% growth in adjusted EPS. Financing costs are down following the redemption of the convertible and the buyback of the remaining 2019 debt. The effective tax rate is in line with our original guidance of 21% and should stay at around this level for the next couple of years. In the future, cash tax will be more in line with the P&L charge. Our statutory EPS is up 40% as the prior year included the one-off costs of various bond buybacks, and the number of shares used for these calculations has increased by 2% following the redemption of the convertible. And our usual planning guide for 2015 modeling is included in the additional information in the back of the pack.\r\nOne of our key financial strengths and areas of focus remains our cash generation. Profit to cash conversion is 91%, lower than last year because of the GBP 47 million invested in scripted projects. This is evidenced in the working capital buildup and, as discussed, represents a good use of the cash, and we're planning for further investment in 2015. Adjusted free cash flow before M&A and dividends is up 10% to GBP 478 million. This strong cash flow has funded GBP 313 million of dividends we paid to shareholders and GBP 214 million of acquisitions, primarily Leftfield. This tight working capital management and strong underlying cash flow means that even after over GBP 500 million of dividends and acquisitions, we've ended the year with a positive net cash position.\r\nAnd it's our confidence in the ongoing cash generation of the business and potential for future growth that's enabled us to give more clarity on our capital structure and dividends. At the interims, we said the ordinary dividend would rise by at least 20% a year from 2014 to 2016, with a view to achieving a level of cover of between 2 and 2.5x. In line with this policy, the strong growth in our EPS means it's appropriate to increase the full year dividend ahead of our previous guidance. Therefore, we're proposing a final dividend of 3.3p, giving a full year of 4.7p, up 34%. We also recognize the importance of capital discipline and running an efficient balance sheet. However, because we continue to see plenty of opportunities for growth, we need flexibility to invest. With strong cash flows, a positive growth outlook and a more balanced business, now is the time for us to gradually increase our leverage. Up to around 1.5x net debt-to-EBITDA will optimize our cost of capital, allow us to maintain our progressive dividend policy and retain the flexibility to continue to invest. A special dividend, returning GBP 250 million to shareholders, reflects this confidence in our cash flow, as in line with this policy.\r\nPulling everything together, we've had another strong year, and the outlook into 2015 is positive across all parts of the business. Our approach to balance sheet and shareholder returns reflects the progress we've made, whilst at the same time, we still see plenty opportunities for further growth. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Adam Crozier (Executives)】\nThanks, Ian. Just a couple of minutes more and then we'll move to Q&A. I just want to, very quickly, remind you of the key strategic opportunities for growth that we have and where our focus will be this year and then give you a bit of a view on the outlook for this year at the same time.\r\nFirst of all, on the opportunities for growth. We outlined these at the half year. They haven't changed, but I just want to handpick out 1 or 2. In the first column, clearly, as we've said, economic recovery is driving growth in the ad market. We will be very focused on maintaining our unique scale and ability to deliver those audiences and growing our share of the total TV and VOD advertising market, a lot of focus going into that.\r\nIn the content side, we continue to work on developing and creating high-quality IP, absolute emphasis on formats, international formats that travel and also using our strong cash flows to produce high-quality, high-profile dramas straight to series and, over time, to build that portfolio. And if you remember, we said we were looking to do around 6 to 10 scripted projects per annum. This year, we'll have 12. So we're performing a bit ahead of where we expected to be. And obviously, within that, as with any creative company, we've got to continue to attract and retain great, greater talent to generate those more hits and to continue to look at acquisitions in line with that strategy and in line with that focus that we've outlined.\r\nThird area, develop -- the key things for us there are to develop new pay services and channels using the increased IP that we have, and we're looking at how we can take those forward, not just in the U.K. but internationally as well. Of course, we've mentioned it before: secure retransmission fees in the medium term. I think everyone is aware there are reviews now up and running by both the government and Ofcom looking at this, and those will, no doubt, ramp up post the election. And we want to continue to scale our international distribution business. So that's where we're going to be concentrating our efforts this year.\r\nFinal slide, just looking to the outlook for the year. In summary, as Ian said, a very strong set of 2014 results means we're entering 2015 in good shape and with really positive momentum. The ad market recovering; NAR, we expect to be up 11% in quarter 1 and 4% to 7% in April. For those who like the detail, that means January was up around 14%; February, 13%. March looks like being around 8% up. Quarter 1 last year was up 2%, so clearly, much stronger growth there. As Ian said, the growth continues to be across most sectors. If you look at the start to this year, as opposed to the numbers Ian showed, retail is up 19%; finance, up 13%; food, up 10%; telecoms, up 32%. It should probably reflect where a lot of activity is -- cars, up 15%. But it will be a different shape. Easter, although it falls in April, it's right at the beginning, and really, the advertising spend, by and large, is in March. And actually, that's quite interesting. Easter last -- April last year was up 19% with Easter, and it's still up 4% to 7% without Easter. So I think that's a sign that the market is reasonably positive, but it will be a different market. I think if you look to last year, there was a bit of a pause when the devolution bill was going through in Scotland, a very short pause. I suspect there might be something similar in May with the general election, and then you've got the absolute shift from the Football World Cup not being there in June versus the Rugby World Cup being there in September and October; so no doubt, a slightly different shape, but generally a positive market, and we do expect to outperform that market. Online, Pay & Interactive revenue, I think we can see, will continue to grow strongly. And as Ian said, I think in Studios, we again expect to deliver around GBP 100 million of revenue growth on a constant currency basis with a return to good organic growth within that; keep and maintain a robust, efficient and flexible balance sheet. And we can see clear opportunities, as I think we've outlined, to invest in further growth whilst increasing shareholder returns at the same time.\r\nAnd overall, I think, as you can probably see, we expect another good performance in 2015. So thank you very much for taking the time to listen, and we're very happy to answer any questions that you have. Thank you very much, indeed.",
      "transcript_text3": "Well then, right. We'll take some questions. There are microphones available. So please wait for the mic. Introduce yourself and, I'm afraid -- speaking for myself, I can only cope with one question at a time. So we'll come back to you for the follow-on. Should we start off, front row here?\n\n---\n\nIt's Will Mairs from Nomura. Three questions. First one, just on your...\n\n---\n\nWhat is it?\n\n---\n\nWell, that lasted a long time.\n\n---\n\nI'm sorry. First one, just on your leverage target, how quickly do you think we can expect you to get up to 1.5x? So should we expect you to pay maybe a special dividend at the year end such that you get up to the even 1.5x? So that's the first one.\n\n---\n\nIan, do you want to take that?\n\n---\n\nThe answer to that is no. You shouldn't expect us to pay a special dividend to get to 1.5x. The purpose of setting a 1.5x -- and the way we're looking at it is it's more of a ceiling. And as I tried to explain, as I was talking through it, we need to keep the balance on our balance sheet in terms of doing the right thing for shareholders but also keeping the flexibility to continue to invest. And as both of us said, we still see plenty of opportunities to invest to grow the business. So we've got to keep that flexibility. Below 1.5x or around 1.5x, our cost of capital is optimized, and that's very important as we're looking to invest. So running the balance sheet at around that level is good. It's got to be flexible to support the strategy, and we will get there over time. I think the key takeaway is we're prepared to take more risk onto our balance sheet than we have done historically, and I think that should be a positive statement around the confidence we have in the future growth and cash flows of the business.\n\n---\n\nJust a second question then. I mean, in terms of Studios, would you agree that, perhaps, now that you're investing more in international scripted shows, that perhaps the dynamics of Studios is becoming temporarily more risky? Because obviously, you need that portfolio to grow, of hit shows. And I guess over the next 2 to 3 years, as you invest in that, there should be more volatility in the margins, perhaps?\n\n---\n\nWell, the margin mix will constantly change depending on the kind of shows we produce because whether it's an international format, a drama, a factual program, some travel, some don't, some are at later stages where they're on third, fourth series. The rates are very different. So the mix is a constantly changing one, and therefore, the margin may move around a little. But actually, the important thing for us to focus on is growing the top line. We spend much more time worrying about that and then running the business as efficiently as we possibly can. I think it's also worth saying, I think whilst growth last year was primarily driven by the acquisitions, I wouldn't want people to think that, that means there is an issue with organic growth. I mean, first of all, we've said very clearly that we expect ITV Studios to show good organic growth next year, but actually, if you look even at last year, the organic growth in the U.S. was around 5%. In the rest of the world, it was around 7%. For GE, the organic growth was around 10%. So there's plenty of good organic growth within Studios. The area where there wasn't good organic growth was in the U.K., which was for a very specific reason, which is a lot of the spend was going on the Football World Cup. So we do expect organic growth. We already have it in most parts of the Studios business, and we expect to have it overall next year. The scripted business is very important for us because that's a $5 billion market on its own, the global scripted business. And a lot of big new customers there, like Netflix, like Amazon, all the big broadcasters are looking for great scripted ideas. We concentrate there on the less risky side, which is we do straight to series. We don't do get involved in the piloting system in the U.S., where it is perfectly possible to burn through, as I'm sure you know, a lot of money very quickly. So we derisk it by going for that sort of straight to series route, and I think that's a very sensible way for us to go. And that's partly why we outlined the 6 to 10 series a year because you -- as you say, you need to build that portfolio, and I think we've made a good start with the 12 dramas we've got coming through this year.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And just last question. I don't expect you to talk on deal negotiation, specifically. So I guess, talking in general, do you think...\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nDo you think it's, perhaps, risky looking to invest in acquisitions within production companies where they have over 50% of their revenues in one type of format?\n\n---\n\nHypothetically speaking?\n\n---\n\nHypothetical.\n\n---\n\nLook, if you -- first of all, the way you should look at any acquisition that we do is, is it on strategy. And I think you can see from this morning, we are very clear about the 2 main areas for focus for Studios going forward: one, building a global scripted business; two, creating a business that has more international formats that can travel. So if we do an acquisition, you should judge it against those 2 things. The second thing -- and we've been upfront about it, saying that we're in exclusive talks with Talpa, and those may or may not come to fruition. But the reality to go to your question is that all production companies have a smaller number of titles that are more important than the rest and the big hits that drive a lot of the revenues. That is not unusual for a content company. That's perfectly normal, and I -- part of the reason for our mixed economy approach that I took you through is what that allows us to do is to ensure that we're not over-reliant on one thing. We're sort of spreading the risk there, and not everything is absolutely firing at exactly the same time. But taken in the round, that allows us to move the business on. So we think that's a very sensible derisked way of doing it, and what we get is all the economies of scale of pulling that together and running it very tightly. But by running them as individual labels, we don't lose that creativity and drive and entrepreneurial spirit. Then we pull it all together with the international distribution. So that's sort of the strategy, if you like, is answering your question of sort of trying to get around that fact that any one thing in its own right can have an element of risk.\n\n---\n\nOkay, thank you. Why don't you just pass the mic behind you?\n\n---\n\nIt's Ian Whittaker from Liberum. First of 3. So you've talked about the fact that the screen will become irrelevant over time, whether it's a tablet or, indeed, a TV screen. Could you just talk about sort of what are the latest development in terms of TV measurement? Because obviously, the U.K. is slightly different from some other markets. And obviously, we're seeing markets such as Norway, for example, they seem to be more advanced in terms of looking at tablet audiences.\n\n---\n\nYes, look, as I said, I think I mentioned that the screen -- viewing through other devices is around 3 minutes, 30 seconds a day. So it's like all of these things, we have to watch, when we're talking about great growth levels, that we don't lose sight of where it sits. What's interesting, so far, is that we -- BARB, like Nielsen in the States, are looking at over, in the medium term, I suspect 2 to 4 years, finding a way to measure viewing on these devices, just as we do for consolidating ratings overnight, 7 days, 3 days, all those kind of things. So I think that is coming in the medium term. There's a lot of work going on in the background to help BARB get up to speed to do that, as there is in America. Norway is a bit out on a limb, to be honest. I've looked at what they do there, and they are the only ones doing it right now. But in any event, I think we'll get there in the medium term. And so what we try to focus on is making sure that we get to a position where our sort of share of viewing online is effectively around about the same as on linear TV. That's sort of where we're trying to move it to. And obviously, that partly depends on how much distribution you have and how many programs you put online because we don't put everything there. One of the more interesting aspects of our online viewing is, I think, about 20% of it is actually of the channel live. And actually, it's one of the things we changed in our ITV Player was you sort of land on the live sec [ph] because people increasingly just want to watch it like they watch TV. They don't want it to look or feel any different. So I think we're -- in some ways, the U.K. is ahead of what others are doing. In some ways, in measurement, we're slightly behind. But I think we're heading in a reasonably clear direction. And we take the view because I think it's a good way for us to think that a screen is a screen, a view is a view, and people just want that flexibility. And of course, although we say that viewing has gone down that little bit, remember, that doesn't include all the viewing on these devices. So in theory, in time, that will get added back in. And it shouldn't be a surprise, I think, that if you can watch TV in more places, like on trains or buses or whatever, you probably will watch more TV. So I think there's a common-sense element to that, too.\n\n---\n\nSecond question, just in terms of the share of the advertising market, obviously, 2014, you benefited from ITV1 in 2013 picking a board in share [ph] for the first time, I think, over 20 years. Obviously, you don't necessarily have that benefit, sort of, this year. So would you expect that your outperformance in share gains of the market would be as great as last year or less so?\n\n---\n\nWell, we certainly -- it's always hard to be exact on that because of the way some 1 or 2 of the deals are done. What's really important to us, and I think most people do understand, is right at the heart of our commercial proposition is this ability to deliver those big audiences that we keep talking about. So we are incredibly focused on those. That is what drives our performance, and that has been remarkably consistent over the last 5 years. Of course, we want to get share of viewing right, but remember, we don't do annual deals per se now. There used to be that thing -- I think I've mentioned before where -- it's very unusual, where you redo all your deals at the same time over a few weeks' period. We now have rolling deals with most, they're mostly never up at the same time, so it's a constantly sort of changing set of arrangements. So we can see from the deals that we've done that we would expect to outperform the market, and we've got to make sure we keep delivering those big audiences. And of course, as we've done with the digital channels, in turning those back around, actually, was the only year, I think, in history that they were down. And thankfully, at the beginning of the year they're back up now. We've got to make sure we concentrate on getting that right. But the key thing people are buying with us is those big audiences. That's where our focus lies.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just a final question for Ian, just on the working capital performance for '15, how should we expect that in comparison with what happened in '14?\n\n---\n\nWe would expect to see continued buildup of the working capital as we invest in scripted. So the normal working capital, we will continue to run tightly. The -- our profit to cash conversion, which is our KPI, which has usually been around 95% -- you can see it came down to 91% this year, will probably be 85% to 90% in 2015 as we continue to invest in scripted content.\n\n---\n\nNext one.\n\n---\n\nIt's Lisa from Goldman Sachs. My first question is on programming cost. I think if we work out the underlying increase in '15, it's about mid-single digit. I was just wondering if we should rethink the kind of operational leverage. Or is it just a kind of one-off to reinvest to improve the ratings?\n\n---\n\nThe program costs, sorry?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think last year, we spent around GBP 35 million more on the schedule, but that, of course, included the launch of the funding and investing in the new channels. This year, that will go up by further GBP 20 million, I think Ian said, which, again, means a full year of those new channels. We, of course, had a big sporting event last year in the World Cup, and we've got an exclusive, big sporting event in the Rugby World Cup this year, which should be very important, very big for us. And we look at that constantly. But in a way, as I said, the reminder last year was that we spent more money, and this year, viewing went down. It's -- as we've consistently said through the period, it's not just about how much money you spend. It's clearly about what you spend it on and, indeed, what others do around that. So we think we're roughly at the right place. Although we have the European Championships next year, which is, obviously, big and very important for us in the summer, the Football European Championships, we only have Europa and Champions League highlights rather than live. So some of that money we will obviously take and reinvest in drama. So what you could expect to see is the genre mix changing in the schedule rather than the cost going up.\n\n---\n\nMy second is on Studios. I mean, you mentioned you expect to return to a good organic growth. Can you be a bit more specific? I think, in the past, you mentioned about 5%. Are you still happy with that number?\n\n---\n\nIan, do you want to take that? I'm not sure we did mention that, but nice try.\n\n---\n\nI think all we said is good organic growth, and we've -- I think we've been pretty clear, saying GBP 100 million, you've got 6 months of Leftfield, and you've got organic revenue coming through. So I'm not going to give you an exact percentage, but I think you could probably have a good stab from what we've given you already to work out, but good growth is -- will contribute to the performance next year.\n\n---\n\nAnd the last one...\n\n---\n\nEveryone seems to be have very interesting debates about what good means, what significant means, what strong means. I have no idea.\n\n---\n\nCarry on.\n\n---\n\nAnd the last one is, I just wanted -- because most of your competitors want to increase their exposure to high-quality scripted dramas. It looks like the big acquisitions you are making are more in unscripted. So I understand the strategy rationale, but I'm just wondering if there's any kind of misperception of the -- maybe the economics of unscripted. Is that kind of more appealing to you?\n\n---\n\nNo. We -- I think what is -- when you look at broadcasters across the world, of course, there is a tremendous demand for high-quality, arguably as-good-as-film drama, and that is more expensive. But broadcasters all over the world haven't also suddenly started spending a lot more on their schedules. So if they're spending a lot more on high-quality drama, something has to give somewhere. And therefore, what they're also spending a lot more money on is really hardworking unscripted shows, where they can order 70, 80, 90, 100 episodes of something. So we are very comfortable that we're in that business. We're the largest in that business in the U.S., and that's doing extremely well. And we do plenty of it here in the U.K., too. We want to make sure we're in the drama sphere, too. And then floating in between those, you have these big formats, big successful formats that people really use and rely on. So those are the 3 sort of segments for us, and we think it's important to be in all of them and have the right mix of all of them.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Can we get to you on the left on the line, and then we'll go back. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nAlex DeGroote at Peel Hunt. One -- just one question. Retransmission fees, your sense, Adam, of the mood music in Westminster right now and any recap on the quantification of the possible benefit of retransmission fees?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think the best sign of the mood music is the fact that both government and Ofcom have announced they will review, and I think that's all we could have asked for. Actually, initially, it was to get it on the agenda, get people thinking about it, get them examining it. Ofcom also have done their -- begun their review into the PSBs. And what's pretty clear out of that is, actually, one of the points we were making, which is that the U.K. production industry is really dependent on the PSBs creating and ordering original work. If you look at their study and they took all their figures direct from all the various broadcasters, I think the digital channels, as a whole, outside of the PSBs, invested -- I think it was about GBP 350 million, in original programming. And if you assume as part of that, ITV digital channels might have been around GBP 50 million. Channel 4 digital channels about the same; UKTV, maybe the same. What that says is that Sky and all the other digital channels, added together, are investing around GBP 200 million per annum in original programming in the U.K. So the industry is still very reliant on the PSBs. It's our investment in that great drama that drives the television market here, and we believe that we should be properly compensated for that. I don't think our view of that has changed at all. We haven't quantified it, as you know, yet. I think there's lots of various sums out there. I guess it also partly depends on how it was done, but that is something that, as the various studies that are going on ramp-up post the election, I'm sure that, that's a conversation that will be had.\n\n---\n\nAll right, thank you for that. We liked that question. Yes?\n\n---\n\nJohn Karidis from Stifel Financial. I've got 2 questions, please. The first one is on the Champions League, just to use the Americanism, can you sort of remind us of the puts and takes in terms of revenue and costs of you not having those rights from next year, please?\n\n---\n\nWe've not given any numbers on it, but we're up -- what we have said is the Champs League, Europa, less the highlights, is about GBP 30 million to GBP 40 million difference in our NPVs. And so that comes back to Adam's earlier point that, that gives us the flexibility to allocate that into different genre, whether it's drama or entertainment.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And you're still of the view that you shouldn't really see an impact on your TV advertising business because of that?\n\n---\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then secondly, talking about mass audiences, is it possible, first of all, to figure out what's been happening to the total number of programs that result in mass audiences over time? And secondly, for a particular program that would have attracted, let's say, 10 million or 5 million viewers, how has that absolute number changed over time?\n\n---\n\nOkay. It is possible to do that. I don't have the numbers off the top of my head, by the way, but it is absolutely, yes, possible to. I think another way of answering though, when you look at the last year's numbers, which have just been analyzed by Thinkbox, what was interesting was that television's reach is 94% of people every week. That hasn't changed at all. So in terms of television -- I'm not talking about ITV. Television's ability to get to people, that has not shifted one iota, so it may be being split slightly differently and, as I mentioned earlier, being fragmented in different ways, but it's still getting to the same sort of very large-scale, high-penetration audience.\n\n---\n\nWe can maybe take that up later. Do you want to -- just drop -- we'll take a couple of questions further back. That one. You can sense the true definition of a roving mic.\n\n---\n\nJulien Roch with Barclays. First question is for you, Adam. How long do you see yourself at ITV? Because it seems to me that one of the market's newest games is Adam is leaving. Still, I don't understand the rules, but I wanted to know how long you are seeing yourself at ITV?\n\n---\n\nWell, unless you know something I don't -- no, I mean, I'm enjoying what I'm doing. I think, as you can see, we're in good shape, and I'm not particularly thinking about anything else, so happy.\n\n---\n\nOkay. A second question for Ian. You gave us some pointers on what you saw was the optimal gearing on the balance sheet of around 1.5, and that's where you wanted to go. What would be the maximum gearing you'd be prepared to go if you had a significant opportunity in terms of M&A?\n\n---\n\nWe haven't set a target for that, Julien, but whatever we do, if we were going even close to 1.5, we'd be looking to use our strong cash flows to bring us back down to continue to create headroom to invest.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And the last question is in 2014, you had about GBP 15 million of cost savings. Could we have some indication for '15?\n\n---\n\nYes. The cost savings for '15, we've not set a target because we're now in that sort of business-as-usual phase. We've done a lot of heavy lifting over the last 4 or 5 years to take a lot of cost down the business, I think best part of GBP 140 million, I think, in total. What we would expect to do, as any good business would do, would be to keep challenging the cost base, looking at it line by line and at least cover the inflationary pressure that all businesses have to face. But the net impact should be to cover inflation next year. So that -- for us, that's somewhere between GBP 5 million and GBP 10 million.\n\n---\n\nOkay, good. Look, I think we'll take one last question. Shall we quickly -- the lady here, if -- yes? We'll come to you in a moment.\n\n---\n\nIt's Emma Dunk from JPMorgan. I just have 2 questions. So first of all, on your leverage, do you have any target credit rating that you're looking to keep? What about 1.5x leverage? Because I know on an adjusted basis, it will be slightly higher.\n\n---\n\nIan?\n\n---\n\nWe do, but we -- the key thing for us is to make sure we have a target we work to that we control. We didn't want to set a target that was driven by external factors, ratings, or didn't factor in things like the pensions, where swings in discount rates could actually move things. So having a measure which we could talk about cleanly and look at in a very transparent way, which is net debt-to-EBITDA, we thought that was the right way to go.\n\n---\n\nAll right. Last shout?\n\n---\n\nIt's William Packer from Exane BNP Paribas. A couple of questions back on the kind of regulatory outlook. So we've heard from the Culture, Media and Sport Committee last week, where they published a report on the future of the BBC. It seemed that, I think it's fair to say, broad bipartisan support for the current license fee structure. In that context, how should we think about your goal of introducing retransmission fees? Could you kind of talk us through what kind of, sort of, institutional setting could drive that, a bit more detail there on how you think they could actually be introduced? And then...\n\n---\n\nOkay, but first, we'll take that.\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, I think what they said was that in the short term, which is not defined, that they can't see a better alternative. But of course, that doesn't discount someone viewing part of the funding as being potentially coming from retransmission fees. I think as a base, they're saying it's difficult to see beyond the license fee. There's a debate about how big or small that should be and how that's made up, whether it's all license fee or part license fee, part retransmission fee. So I think that's all up for debate as part of the BBC schedule. I think what they -- our view on a few of the other things that BBC put forward was sort of for them to decide in some ways whether they want to close BBC Three. We would simply make the point that, that is one of the few very distinctive things they do and that their charter is about being distinctive. That's doing something that commercial broadcasters often find difficult. And what they're planning to do is to close that and effectively reinvest that in a plus one service, which is exactly the kind of thing a commercial broadcaster would do. So now it was becoming, in an overall sense, less distinctive. And it was good to see the select committee come out very clearly and say that the BBC really hadn't made the case for a BBC One plus one service at all, actually. So we'll see what happens there, but I don't think the debate around their funding has frankly even begun, and I don't think it will in any earnest at all really until after elections once they know who they're dealing with.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Last and final.\n\n---\n\nAnd then you -- there's been a lot of discussion about the potential benefits of regulatory relief around introduction of retransmission fees, et cetera. In terms of the potential downside of deregulation, you've had independent bodies such as COBA comment on the sort of implicit subsidy around the spectrum and the sports rights with the crown jewels, et cetera. Can you talk about how you see things would look for you in the context where there was a deregulation around those side of things? Is that something you've considered? Do you see a big downside there? Or are you relatively confident?\n\n---\n\nWell, if I was a journalist, I might take issue with COBA being independent, I suspect, but leaving that aside, look, I think that the work that Ofcom have already done into PSBs that I mentioned earlier, I think that kind of starts the real debate, which is it is the investment -- I don't just mean ITV, by the way, but all the PSBs make in original content that really drives the market in the U.K. and has driven the performance of television in the U.K. It's a very successful industry for us but also for the country. It's about 6% of GDP, and it's a good part of our exports as well. So it's a good thing for the country. It's a big part of the success of the creative industries. I think clearly, in the round of that, I think what tends to get forgotten in that whole debate -- I know COBA, from time to time, will say, \"Well, yes, but you get advantages as a PSB.\" But of course, we pay for those advantages. We've already paid for those. One of the costs of our license is that we invest around GBP 100 million in news every year. That's the cost of the license, and we do all sorts of other things around that, too, as do, in fairness, the BBC and Channel 4. So when we got our renewed license for 10 years, there was a basic set of scales of costs and benefits, and those came out as neutral. And that's as it should be. So I think that part of the conversation has already taken place. I think there is a very interesting debate on sports rights, and you can go from one extreme, like Australia, where all the main sports are protected, to somewhere that's completely open, and then us in the U.K. somewhere in the middle. But if you look at most sports, what's fascinating to me is that cricket is gradually trying to come back free-to-air. Darts has gradually come back free-to-air. Boxing is trying to come back free-to-air. One of the good things about going pure pay is you probably get a lot more money. One of the not-so-good things is your exposure goes down pretty sharply in terms of awareness. And if you look at something like the Champions League, I think we attracted more for our one game than Sky did for their 17. And as a sports right holder -- and I used to be one, that is something, in the long term, you have to think quite long and hard about because it's that interest and exposure that drives participation. It drives sponsorship. It drives merchandising. It drives interest in the game. It drives the people who buy your pay-per-view subscriptions. So you've got to balance the 2.\n\n---\n\nAll right. Thank you. Those are all good questions. These are very good set of results, and this, I think we'll cut short there. We're happy to stay around -- I know the team is, to answer any questions or [indiscernible] discussions later. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThanks, everyone. Thank you very much.",
      "transcript_text4": "【回答: Archie Norman (Executives)】\nWell then, right. We'll take some questions. There are microphones available. So please wait for the mic. Introduce yourself and, I'm afraid -- speaking for myself, I can only cope with one question at a time. So we'll come back to you for the follow-on. Should we start off, front row here?\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Mairs (Analysts)】\nIt's Will Mairs from Nomura. Three questions. First one, just on your...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Archie Norman (Executives)】\nWhat is it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adam Crozier (Executives)】\nWell, that lasted a long time.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Mairs (Analysts)】\nI'm sorry. First one, just on your leverage target, how quickly do you think we can expect you to get up to 1.5x? So should we expect you to pay maybe a special dividend at the year end such that you get up to the even 1.5x? So that's the first one.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adam Crozier (Executives)】\nIan, do you want to take that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ian Griffiths (Executives)】\nThe answer to that is no. You shouldn't expect us to pay a special dividend to get to 1.5x. The purpose of setting a 1.5x -- and the way we're looking at it is it's more of a ceiling. And as I tried to explain, as I was talking through it, we need to keep the balance on our balance sheet in terms of doing the right thing for shareholders but also keeping the flexibility to continue to invest. And as both of us said, we still see plenty of opportunities to invest to grow the business. So we've got to keep that flexibility. Below 1.5x or around 1.5x, our cost of capital is optimized, and that's very important as we're looking to invest. So running the balance sheet at around that level is good. It's got to be flexible to support the strategy, and we will get there over time. I think the key takeaway is we're prepared to take more risk onto our balance sheet than we have done historically, and I think that should be a positive statement around the confidence we have in the future growth and cash flows of the business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Mairs (Analysts)】\nJust a second question then. I mean, in terms of Studios, would you agree that, perhaps, now that you're investing more in international scripted shows, that perhaps the dynamics of Studios is becoming temporarily more risky? Because obviously, you need that portfolio to grow, of hit shows. And I guess over the next 2 to 3 years, as you invest in that, there should be more volatility in the margins, perhaps?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adam Crozier (Executives)】\nWell, the margin mix will constantly change depending on the kind of shows we produce because whether it's an international format, a drama, a factual program, some travel, some don't, some are at later stages where they're on third, fourth series. The rates are very different. So the mix is a constantly changing one, and therefore, the margin may move around a little. But actually, the important thing for us to focus on is growing the top line. We spend much more time worrying about that and then running the business as efficiently as we possibly can. I think it's also worth saying, I think whilst growth last year was primarily driven by the acquisitions, I wouldn't want people to think that, that means there is an issue with organic growth. I mean, first of all, we've said very clearly that we expect ITV Studios to show good organic growth next year, but actually, if you look even at last year, the organic growth in the U.S. was around 5%. In the rest of the world, it was around 7%. For GE, the organic growth was around 10%. So there's plenty of good organic growth within Studios. The area where there wasn't good organic growth was in the U.K., which was for a very specific reason, which is a lot of the spend was going on the Football World Cup. So we do expect organic growth. We already have it in most parts of the Studios business, and we expect to have it overall next year. The scripted business is very important for us because that's a $5 billion market on its own, the global scripted business. And a lot of big new customers there, like Netflix, like Amazon, all the big broadcasters are looking for great scripted ideas. We concentrate there on the less risky side, which is we do straight to series. We don't do get involved in the piloting system in the U.S., where it is perfectly possible to burn through, as I'm sure you know, a lot of money very quickly. So we derisk it by going for that sort of straight to series route, and I think that's a very sensible way for us to go. And that's partly why we outlined the 6 to 10 series a year because you -- as you say, you need to build that portfolio, and I think we've made a good start with the 12 dramas we've got coming through this year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Mairs (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And just last question. I don't expect you to talk on deal negotiation, specifically. So I guess, talking in general, do you think...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adam Crozier (Executives)】\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Mairs (Analysts)】\nDo you think it's, perhaps, risky looking to invest in acquisitions within production companies where they have over 50% of their revenues in one type of format?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adam Crozier (Executives)】\nHypothetically speaking?\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Mairs (Analysts)】\nHypothetical.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adam Crozier (Executives)】\nLook, if you -- first of all, the way you should look at any acquisition that we do is, is it on strategy. And I think you can see from this morning, we are very clear about the 2 main areas for focus for Studios going forward: one, building a global scripted business; two, creating a business that has more international formats that can travel. So if we do an acquisition, you should judge it against those 2 things. The second thing -- and we've been upfront about it, saying that we're in exclusive talks with Talpa, and those may or may not come to fruition. But the reality to go to your question is that all production companies have a smaller number of titles that are more important than the rest and the big hits that drive a lot of the revenues. That is not unusual for a content company. That's perfectly normal, and I -- part of the reason for our mixed economy approach that I took you through is what that allows us to do is to ensure that we're not over-reliant on one thing. We're sort of spreading the risk there, and not everything is absolutely firing at exactly the same time. But taken in the round, that allows us to move the business on. So we think that's a very sensible derisked way of doing it, and what we get is all the economies of scale of pulling that together and running it very tightly. But by running them as individual labels, we don't lose that creativity and drive and entrepreneurial spirit. Then we pull it all together with the international distribution. So that's sort of the strategy, if you like, is answering your question of sort of trying to get around that fact that any one thing in its own right can have an element of risk.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Archie Norman (Executives)】\nOkay, thank you. Why don't you just pass the mic behind you?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ian Whittaker (Analysts)】\nIt's Ian Whittaker from Liberum. First of 3. So you've talked about the fact that the screen will become irrelevant over time, whether it's a tablet or, indeed, a TV screen. Could you just talk about sort of what are the latest development in terms of TV measurement? Because obviously, the U.K. is slightly different from some other markets. And obviously, we're seeing markets such as Norway, for example, they seem to be more advanced in terms of looking at tablet audiences.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adam Crozier (Executives)】\nYes, look, as I said, I think I mentioned that the screen -- viewing through other devices is around 3 minutes, 30 seconds a day. So it's like all of these things, we have to watch, when we're talking about great growth levels, that we don't lose sight of where it sits. What's interesting, so far, is that we -- BARB, like Nielsen in the States, are looking at over, in the medium term, I suspect 2 to 4 years, finding a way to measure viewing on these devices, just as we do for consolidating ratings overnight, 7 days, 3 days, all those kind of things. So I think that is coming in the medium term. There's a lot of work going on in the background to help BARB get up to speed to do that, as there is in America. Norway is a bit out on a limb, to be honest. I've looked at what they do there, and they are the only ones doing it right now. But in any event, I think we'll get there in the medium term. And so what we try to focus on is making sure that we get to a position where our sort of share of viewing online is effectively around about the same as on linear TV. That's sort of where we're trying to move it to. And obviously, that partly depends on how much distribution you have and how many programs you put online because we don't put everything there. One of the more interesting aspects of our online viewing is, I think, about 20% of it is actually of the channel live. And actually, it's one of the things we changed in our ITV Player was you sort of land on the live sec [ph] because people increasingly just want to watch it like they watch TV. They don't want it to look or feel any different. So I think we're -- in some ways, the U.K. is ahead of what others are doing. In some ways, in measurement, we're slightly behind. But I think we're heading in a reasonably clear direction. And we take the view because I think it's a good way for us to think that a screen is a screen, a view is a view, and people just want that flexibility. And of course, although we say that viewing has gone down that little bit, remember, that doesn't include all the viewing on these devices. So in theory, in time, that will get added back in. And it shouldn't be a surprise, I think, that if you can watch TV in more places, like on trains or buses or whatever, you probably will watch more TV. So I think there's a common-sense element to that, too.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ian Whittaker (Analysts)】\nSecond question, just in terms of the share of the advertising market, obviously, 2014, you benefited from ITV1 in 2013 picking a board in share [ph] for the first time, I think, over 20 years. Obviously, you don't necessarily have that benefit, sort of, this year. So would you expect that your outperformance in share gains of the market would be as great as last year or less so?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adam Crozier (Executives)】\nWell, we certainly -- it's always hard to be exact on that because of the way some 1 or 2 of the deals are done. What's really important to us, and I think most people do understand, is right at the heart of our commercial proposition is this ability to deliver those big audiences that we keep talking about. So we are incredibly focused on those. That is what drives our performance, and that has been remarkably consistent over the last 5 years. Of course, we want to get share of viewing right, but remember, we don't do annual deals per se now. There used to be that thing -- I think I've mentioned before where -- it's very unusual, where you redo all your deals at the same time over a few weeks' period. We now have rolling deals with most, they're mostly never up at the same time, so it's a constantly sort of changing set of arrangements. So we can see from the deals that we've done that we would expect to outperform the market, and we've got to make sure we keep delivering those big audiences. And of course, as we've done with the digital channels, in turning those back around, actually, was the only year, I think, in history that they were down. And thankfully, at the beginning of the year they're back up now. We've got to make sure we concentrate on getting that right. But the key thing people are buying with us is those big audiences. That's where our focus lies.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ian Whittaker (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just a final question for Ian, just on the working capital performance for '15, how should we expect that in comparison with what happened in '14?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ian Griffiths (Executives)】\nWe would expect to see continued buildup of the working capital as we invest in scripted. So the normal working capital, we will continue to run tightly. The -- our profit to cash conversion, which is our KPI, which has usually been around 95% -- you can see it came down to 91% this year, will probably be 85% to 90% in 2015 as we continue to invest in scripted content.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Archie Norman (Executives)】\nNext one.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Yang (Analysts)】\nIt's Lisa from Goldman Sachs. My first question is on programming cost. I think if we work out the underlying increase in '15, it's about mid-single digit. I was just wondering if we should rethink the kind of operational leverage. Or is it just a kind of one-off to reinvest to improve the ratings?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adam Crozier (Executives)】\nThe program costs, sorry?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Yang (Analysts)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adam Crozier (Executives)】\nYes, I think last year, we spent around GBP 35 million more on the schedule, but that, of course, included the launch of the funding and investing in the new channels. This year, that will go up by further GBP 20 million, I think Ian said, which, again, means a full year of those new channels. We, of course, had a big sporting event last year in the World Cup, and we've got an exclusive, big sporting event in the Rugby World Cup this year, which should be very important, very big for us. And we look at that constantly. But in a way, as I said, the reminder last year was that we spent more money, and this year, viewing went down. It's -- as we've consistently said through the period, it's not just about how much money you spend. It's clearly about what you spend it on and, indeed, what others do around that. So we think we're roughly at the right place. Although we have the European Championships next year, which is, obviously, big and very important for us in the summer, the Football European Championships, we only have Europa and Champions League highlights rather than live. So some of that money we will obviously take and reinvest in drama. So what you could expect to see is the genre mix changing in the schedule rather than the cost going up.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Yang (Analysts)】\nMy second is on Studios. I mean, you mentioned you expect to return to a good organic growth. Can you be a bit more specific? I think, in the past, you mentioned about 5%. Are you still happy with that number?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adam Crozier (Executives)】\nIan, do you want to take that? I'm not sure we did mention that, but nice try.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ian Griffiths (Executives)】\nI think all we said is good organic growth, and we've -- I think we've been pretty clear, saying GBP 100 million, you've got 6 months of Leftfield, and you've got organic revenue coming through. So I'm not going to give you an exact percentage, but I think you could probably have a good stab from what we've given you already to work out, but good growth is -- will contribute to the performance next year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Yang (Analysts)】\nAnd the last one...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adam Crozier (Executives)】\nEveryone seems to be have very interesting debates about what good means, what significant means, what strong means. I have no idea.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Archie Norman (Executives)】\nCarry on.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lisa Yang (Analysts)】\nAnd the last one is, I just wanted -- because most of your competitors want to increase their exposure to high-quality scripted dramas. It looks like the big acquisitions you are making are more in unscripted. So I understand the strategy rationale, but I'm just wondering if there's any kind of misperception of the -- maybe the economics of unscripted. Is that kind of more appealing to you?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adam Crozier (Executives)】\nNo. We -- I think what is -- when you look at broadcasters across the world, of course, there is a tremendous demand for high-quality, arguably as-good-as-film drama, and that is more expensive. But broadcasters all over the world haven't also suddenly started spending a lot more on their schedules. So if they're spending a lot more on high-quality drama, something has to give somewhere. And therefore, what they're also spending a lot more money on is really hardworking unscripted shows, where they can order 70, 80, 90, 100 episodes of something. So we are very comfortable that we're in that business. We're the largest in that business in the U.S., and that's doing extremely well. And we do plenty of it here in the U.K., too. We want to make sure we're in the drama sphere, too. And then floating in between those, you have these big formats, big successful formats that people really use and rely on. So those are the 3 sort of segments for us, and we think it's important to be in all of them and have the right mix of all of them.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Archie Norman (Executives)】\nOkay. Can we get to you on the left on the line, and then we'll go back. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alexander DeGroote (Analysts)】\nAlex DeGroote at Peel Hunt. One -- just one question. Retransmission fees, your sense, Adam, of the mood music in Westminster right now and any recap on the quantification of the possible benefit of retransmission fees?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adam Crozier (Executives)】\nWell, I think the best sign of the mood music is the fact that both government and Ofcom have announced they will review, and I think that's all we could have asked for. Actually, initially, it was to get it on the agenda, get people thinking about it, get them examining it. Ofcom also have done their -- begun their review into the PSBs. And what's pretty clear out of that is, actually, one of the points we were making, which is that the U.K. production industry is really dependent on the PSBs creating and ordering original work. If you look at their study and they took all their figures direct from all the various broadcasters, I think the digital channels, as a whole, outside of the PSBs, invested -- I think it was about GBP 350 million, in original programming. And if you assume as part of that, ITV digital channels might have been around GBP 50 million. Channel 4 digital channels about the same; UKTV, maybe the same. What that says is that Sky and all the other digital channels, added together, are investing around GBP 200 million per annum in original programming in the U.K. So the industry is still very reliant on the PSBs. It's our investment in that great drama that drives the television market here, and we believe that we should be properly compensated for that. I don't think our view of that has changed at all. We haven't quantified it, as you know, yet. I think there's lots of various sums out there. I guess it also partly depends on how it was done, but that is something that, as the various studies that are going on ramp-up post the election, I'm sure that, that's a conversation that will be had.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Archie Norman (Executives)】\nAll right, thank you for that. We liked that question. Yes?\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Karidis (Analysts)】\nJohn Karidis from Stifel Financial. I've got 2 questions, please. The first one is on the Champions League, just to use the Americanism, can you sort of remind us of the puts and takes in terms of revenue and costs of you not having those rights from next year, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ian Griffiths (Executives)】\nWe've not given any numbers on it, but we're up -- what we have said is the Champs League, Europa, less the highlights, is about GBP 30 million to GBP 40 million difference in our NPVs. And so that comes back to Adam's earlier point that, that gives us the flexibility to allocate that into different genre, whether it's drama or entertainment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Karidis (Analysts)】\nOkay. And you're still of the view that you shouldn't really see an impact on your TV advertising business because of that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ian Griffiths (Executives)】\nNo.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Karidis (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then secondly, talking about mass audiences, is it possible, first of all, to figure out what's been happening to the total number of programs that result in mass audiences over time? And secondly, for a particular program that would have attracted, let's say, 10 million or 5 million viewers, how has that absolute number changed over time?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adam Crozier (Executives)】\nOkay. It is possible to do that. I don't have the numbers off the top of my head, by the way, but it is absolutely, yes, possible to. I think another way of answering though, when you look at the last year's numbers, which have just been analyzed by Thinkbox, what was interesting was that television's reach is 94% of people every week. That hasn't changed at all. So in terms of television -- I'm not talking about ITV. Television's ability to get to people, that has not shifted one iota, so it may be being split slightly differently and, as I mentioned earlier, being fragmented in different ways, but it's still getting to the same sort of very large-scale, high-penetration audience.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Archie Norman (Executives)】\nWe can maybe take that up later. Do you want to -- just drop -- we'll take a couple of questions further back. That one. You can sense the true definition of a roving mic.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Julien Roch (Analysts)】\nJulien Roch with Barclays. First question is for you, Adam. How long do you see yourself at ITV? Because it seems to me that one of the market's newest games is Adam is leaving. Still, I don't understand the rules, but I wanted to know how long you are seeing yourself at ITV?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adam Crozier (Executives)】\nWell, unless you know something I don't -- no, I mean, I'm enjoying what I'm doing. I think, as you can see, we're in good shape, and I'm not particularly thinking about anything else, so happy.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Julien Roch (Analysts)】\nOkay. A second question for Ian. You gave us some pointers on what you saw was the optimal gearing on the balance sheet of around 1.5, and that's where you wanted to go. What would be the maximum gearing you'd be prepared to go if you had a significant opportunity in terms of M&A?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ian Griffiths (Executives)】\nWe haven't set a target for that, Julien, but whatever we do, if we were going even close to 1.5, we'd be looking to use our strong cash flows to bring us back down to continue to create headroom to invest.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Julien Roch (Analysts)】\nOkay. And the last question is in 2014, you had about GBP 15 million of cost savings. Could we have some indication for '15?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ian Griffiths (Executives)】\nYes. The cost savings for '15, we've not set a target because we're now in that sort of business-as-usual phase. We've done a lot of heavy lifting over the last 4 or 5 years to take a lot of cost down the business, I think best part of GBP 140 million, I think, in total. What we would expect to do, as any good business would do, would be to keep challenging the cost base, looking at it line by line and at least cover the inflationary pressure that all businesses have to face. But the net impact should be to cover inflation next year. So that -- for us, that's somewhere between GBP 5 million and GBP 10 million.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Archie Norman (Executives)】\nOkay, good. Look, I think we'll take one last question. Shall we quickly -- the lady here, if -- yes? We'll come to you in a moment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Emma Dunk (Analysts)】\nIt's Emma Dunk from JPMorgan. I just have 2 questions. So first of all, on your leverage, do you have any target credit rating that you're looking to keep? What about 1.5x leverage? Because I know on an adjusted basis, it will be slightly higher.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adam Crozier (Executives)】\nIan?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ian Griffiths (Executives)】\nWe do, but we -- the key thing for us is to make sure we have a target we work to that we control. We didn't want to set a target that was driven by external factors, ratings, or didn't factor in things like the pensions, where swings in discount rates could actually move things. So having a measure which we could talk about cleanly and look at in a very transparent way, which is net debt-to-EBITDA, we thought that was the right way to go.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Archie Norman (Executives)】\nAll right. Last shout?\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Packer (Analysts)】\nIt's William Packer from Exane BNP Paribas. A couple of questions back on the kind of regulatory outlook. So we've heard from the Culture, Media and Sport Committee last week, where they published a report on the future of the BBC. It seemed that, I think it's fair to say, broad bipartisan support for the current license fee structure. In that context, how should we think about your goal of introducing retransmission fees? Could you kind of talk us through what kind of, sort of, institutional setting could drive that, a bit more detail there on how you think they could actually be introduced? And then...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Archie Norman (Executives)】\nOkay, but first, we'll take that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adam Crozier (Executives)】\nYes. Well, I think what they said was that in the short term, which is not defined, that they can't see a better alternative. But of course, that doesn't discount someone viewing part of the funding as being potentially coming from retransmission fees. I think as a base, they're saying it's difficult to see beyond the license fee. There's a debate about how big or small that should be and how that's made up, whether it's all license fee or part license fee, part retransmission fee. So I think that's all up for debate as part of the BBC schedule. I think what they -- our view on a few of the other things that BBC put forward was sort of for them to decide in some ways whether they want to close BBC Three. We would simply make the point that, that is one of the few very distinctive things they do and that their charter is about being distinctive. That's doing something that commercial broadcasters often find difficult. And what they're planning to do is to close that and effectively reinvest that in a plus one service, which is exactly the kind of thing a commercial broadcaster would do. So now it was becoming, in an overall sense, less distinctive. And it was good to see the select committee come out very clearly and say that the BBC really hadn't made the case for a BBC One plus one service at all, actually. So we'll see what happens there, but I don't think the debate around their funding has frankly even begun, and I don't think it will in any earnest at all really until after elections once they know who they're dealing with.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Archie Norman (Executives)】\nOkay. Last and final.\n\n---\n\n【質問: William Packer (Analysts)】\nAnd then you -- there's been a lot of discussion about the potential benefits of regulatory relief around introduction of retransmission fees, et cetera. In terms of the potential downside of deregulation, you've had independent bodies such as COBA comment on the sort of implicit subsidy around the spectrum and the sports rights with the crown jewels, et cetera. Can you talk about how you see things would look for you in the context where there was a deregulation around those side of things? Is that something you've considered? Do you see a big downside there? Or are you relatively confident?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adam Crozier (Executives)】\nWell, if I was a journalist, I might take issue with COBA being independent, I suspect, but leaving that aside, look, I think that the work that Ofcom have already done into PSBs that I mentioned earlier, I think that kind of starts the real debate, which is it is the investment -- I don't just mean ITV, by the way, but all the PSBs make in original content that really drives the market in the U.K. and has driven the performance of television in the U.K. It's a very successful industry for us but also for the country. It's about 6% of GDP, and it's a good part of our exports as well. So it's a good thing for the country. It's a big part of the success of the creative industries. I think clearly, in the round of that, I think what tends to get forgotten in that whole debate -- I know COBA, from time to time, will say, \"Well, yes, but you get advantages as a PSB.\" But of course, we pay for those advantages. We've already paid for those. One of the costs of our license is that we invest around GBP 100 million in news every year. That's the cost of the license, and we do all sorts of other things around that, too, as do, in fairness, the BBC and Channel 4. So when we got our renewed license for 10 years, there was a basic set of scales of costs and benefits, and those came out as neutral. And that's as it should be. So I think that part of the conversation has already taken place. I think there is a very interesting debate on sports rights, and you can go from one extreme, like Australia, where all the main sports are protected, to somewhere that's completely open, and then us in the U.K. somewhere in the middle. But if you look at most sports, what's fascinating to me is that cricket is gradually trying to come back free-to-air. Darts has gradually come back free-to-air. Boxing is trying to come back free-to-air. One of the good things about going pure pay is you probably get a lot more money. One of the not-so-good things is your exposure goes down pretty sharply in terms of awareness. And if you look at something like the Champions League, I think we attracted more for our one game than Sky did for their 17. And as a sports right holder -- and I used to be one, that is something, in the long term, you have to think quite long and hard about because it's that interest and exposure that drives participation. It drives sponsorship. It drives merchandising. It drives interest in the game. It drives the people who buy your pay-per-view subscriptions. So you've got to balance the 2.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Archie Norman (Executives)】\nAll right. Thank you. Those are all good questions. These are very good set of results, and this, I think we'll cut short there. We're happy to stay around -- I know the team is, to answer any questions or [indiscernible] discussions later. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Adam Crozier (Executives)】\nThanks, everyone. Thank you very much.",

I wasn't going to give you a reminder about turning off the mobile phones, but it's easy to forget. So please do check if they are off. That said, welcome to Hannover Re's Analyst Conference. It's a pleasure to see that so many of you have taken up the invitation and we are very delighted to present to you the numbers for the financial year 2014 in greater detail, the numbers which we have published already this morning.\r\nToday, we have a new feature compared to previous analyst conferences. We are offering additional dialing option for all those who were not able to participate here physically, here at the London Stock Exchange. [Operator Instructions]\r\nFirst of all, Ulrich Wallin, will kick things off with a brief overview of the 2014 financial year. Roland Vogel, our CFO, will then move on to present the financials in detail. Afterwards, we will be happy to respond at length to all your questions you might have. And I would like to point out that you are kindly asked to wait for the microphone so that everybody can understand your question, even those who are not in the room.\r\nOn that note, I'm delighted to hand over to Ulrich Wallin.\n\n---\n\nYes, good afternoon, and welcome to our presentation of our 2014 results. I will kick it off. I will also finish it off with the outlook for the coming year.\r\nWell, I mean, 2014 for us was quite a good year, I would say. I mean, as you can see, we managed to increase the after-tax earnings of the group by more than 10% and this has been driven by a strong underlying earnings from all segments so that we could continue our rather conservative policy when it comes to reserves, be it on the P&C side or be it on the Life & Health side. So from that point of view, we didn't need to be aggressive on any of the various items of the profit and loss account and the balance sheet in order to generate this increased profitability.\r\nWe also decided to increase the dividend via a special dividend of EUR 1.25 together with the ordinary dividend of EUR 3 to EUR 4.25. And this is due to the fact that our capital grew rather remarkably by 28.2%, and then of course, which means that the excess capital also has increased. And of course, the ROE for the current year would be a little bit more stressed so that it was the right time to start with the capital management for Hannover Re, which we already announced at our last Investor Day.\r\nYou can see that the business continues to grow, even though at a lower pace, due to the rather challenging market on the P&C side, whereas well publicized the competition has increased quite significantly. But nonetheless, as the business continues to grow both the P&C business, as well as the Life & Health business. As already mentioned, the bottom line grew more pronounced as compared to the top line with almost 20% growth of the EBIT compared to last year and as already mentioned, 10.1% of the after-tax earnings.\r\nDespite the significant growth of the capital, the ROE is still at a quite acceptable level with 14.7%. So we continue to enjoy attractive ROEs. If we then look at individual business groups, overall, as the Property & Casualty business, we are happy. I mean, we think development has been positive. EBIT grew by 12.2%. Admittedly, one might say that the combined ratio, particularly in the fourth quarter, some of you might have expected a slightly lower combined ratio. On the other hand, we are quite happy with the after-tax result of the P&C business group and we were also quite pleased that we could keep with our conservative loss reserving policy, which is the result, of course, of the quality of the underlying business. But also, and that shouldn't be forgotten, of the fact that the large losses came in well within the budget and this, of course, means there was no pressure or deviation of pressure to the combined ratio from the large loss site, which really pretty much offset the pressure on the combined ratio, of course, there from the reduced rates, which we see as a result of the current soft market. So therefore, we could keep the loss reserving policy rather unchanged, a little bit better than we actually had expected.\r\nWith the Life & Health business, I'm quite pleased that the earnings have actually increased, the EBIT increased by 75% and also, we had a 25% increase of the post-tax earnings. This is in line which -- what we are trying to tell you since quite some while, certainly, since the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2013. This year, this was still an easy target to have because our 2013 numbers, of course, were depressed due to the additional reserves that we put on the DII business, which we luckily can say now seem to be a conservative. So what really happened in 2014 as the results normalized. I mean they're not terribly exciting, but they are more to the normal level that we expect from our Life & Health business. I would say the technical result, particular in the fourth quarter, a little bit below what we're expecting. Again partly, I mean, conservative reserving on the enhanced annuities, partly negative deviation of the actual to expected on the ING portfolio. So but, overall, I mean, pretty much in line with expectation for 2014, as a whole year. But -- I mean, everything has a positive as well. I mean, if you look forward to 2015, we feel that there is room for -- through the improvement of the results of Life & Health.\r\nWe were very happy all together with the investment results, ordinary income app[indiscernible], which is quite remarkable considering the rather low interest rates environment that we are wrestling with. Here again, I mean, the increase in volume helped significantly. Also, it turned out to be a quite favorable for us that we changed the functional currency of Bermuda subsidiaries at the end of 2013 from euros to U.S. dollar because in restructuring the portfolio of around EUR 1.4 billion at the time into U.S. dollars, of course, if you have meant that we had to sell euro securities, which resulted in realized gains. And at the same time, the new investment in U.S. dollars were down at a time when the interest rates in U.S. dollars had a little spike. So even on those investments we already have realized gains. And also the running yields in U.S. dollars was slightly higher than in euros, particular since recently the -- is at the year started some new experiments with the euro currency. So overall, we were very pleased with our investment income.\r\nThis is the broad overview of what we see for 2014. The finer details, Roland will explain to you in great detail. Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Uli. I think you mentioned already some parts of -- or the major parts of our key figures and results. But I think we should start with, before we get into the detailed P&L, we should look at some key metrics or remarkable developments of key metrics, which were not only driven by us, but also by the markets or the ease it be[indiscernible] or whomsoever. First of all, the strong cash flow for 2014, nearly reached the 2 billion mark again. We started a little bit slow into the year. I think we mentioned at previous occasions that there was one U.S. mobility contract. And we might come to that contract, again a little bit later, which was cash negative in the first 2 quarters. This will turn around. It has already. And it will turn around in 2015. So we will get that money back, but the second half year, with very strong cash flow, which I think supports the positive message and the quality of the results even with a little bit of more depressed overall growth, the cash flow stays very positive.\r\nOn the right-hand side, the assets under own management up by 14% or EUR 4.5 billion. I can tell you with the development of the U.S. dollar and the yields, especially the yields of the government bonds, this, today, is approaching EUR 39 billion. So the increase is really remarkable. And again, this is not only driven by a very good result, but also the yields and especially the currency exchange rates.\r\nThe same goes for the capital position on the next slide. Equity increased by nearly EUR 1.7 billion or 28%, the policyholder surplus by EUR 1.5 billion. Why is that a little bit different? Because we paid back EUR 750 million in February and we issued the subordinated bond, and we issued a new subordinated bond in September with another EUR 500 million, which then again, was the reason why the policyholder surplus decreased order. Subordinated bonds here decreased a little bit. You might remember there is another call date coming up in June for EUR 500 million. Up to now, we indicated that the last EUR 500 million was already an early refinancing. This is not an announcement that we will call that up to now we have called every subordinated bond at its first call date. So one might expect that this green part of the bar might go down in June. On the other side of that slide, you see the increase in the shareholders' equity. And I think that demonstrates very clearly, where this increase is -- strong increase is coming from. First of all, of course, EUR 986 million of result. The dividend we paid last year was the EUR 362 million. And that demonstrates that the increase coming from the valuation reserves on our invested assets, as well as the currency exchange rates. This is more than EUR 1 billion and it's even higher than what we had produced as profits. Now you might want to distinguish these 2 components for the increased or the increased assets from the currency exchange rates. I think this is also reflected on the earnings side by higher U.S. dollar, Aussie dollar, whatever, earnings. So we earn also higher euro values on these amounts. When you look at the valuation reserves, the more than EUR 630 million in the middle that is an increase, which is really an increase in our capital base, which also will have an impact on the future ROIs. The overall number of OCI or capital driven by market -- by the valuation reserves in our asset portfolio is 1.5 -- EUR 1.2 billion, nearly. And with a modified duration of 5 years, one could expect everything equal. We might lose EUR 120 million per year because this will run off. This will be capital components, which will disappear in the future, but it's only EUR 120 million per year.\r\nI think this leads us directly into the capital management actions, which Uli had already mentioned. Here, you see a -- from my point of view, impressive picture. If you look at the last 6 years, 6 years ago, we came here and mentioned that it is our intention to decrease the volatility in our earnings, to decrease the volatility in our dividend payments. And if you look at that picture here, you'll see that we were rather successful, of course, helped by the markets and also the catastrophe components in our business. But even in 2011, which was the second highest natural catastrophe burden in the history of the insurance, we managed to provide a good dividend. The EUR 3-plus, the bonus do represent EUR 150 million. So that is what we kind of give back to our shareholders as a start of -- potential capital management action. The dividend yield today or a few days ago, 5%; if you go back to the beginning of the year, 6%; if you go back 1-year and you had invested into Hannover Re share 1-year ago, the dividend yield would even be above 7%.\r\nOne other perspective at the capital development and the ROEs we have provided and do provide. I think the chart demonstrates clearly the achievement. The average capital position has been increasing remarkably from the EUR 4 billion to the EUR 6.7 billion this year. Still we managed to keep the ROE on a very, very high level. On the right-hand side you see the average achievements. On the left-hand side, the last 5 years. The margins over or above the hurdle and we have shown here the old total, the 750 basis points, as well as the new hurdle, the 900 basis points has even increased over the last years, but we have to bear in mind that this has got to be more challenging in the future, with the high capital position and with also the higher volatile capital components. I have tried to explain to you with the OCI positions, which might be volatile in the future. So this is going to be more challenging into the future and this is why we also look at managing the capital position, as well as the income position up there.\r\nI think that -- then leads us directly into the peer comparison, which we always do. I think we are still the #1 on the 4-year horizon. This year, 2 Bermudan companies are in front of us. I think that is not very surprising because of the very low cap burden, which the industry has been seeing. So in that regard, we are still happy and we are still committed to stay one of the most profitable reinsurers in the industry, also, in the future.\r\nSo let's then have a brief look at the P&L in more detail. On the group level, I think it's not necessary to repeat the growth of the turnover of the premium. The first component I think which needs some explanation is the other income and expense line here. We have been long in the U.S. dollar and the -- in other non-euro currencies already over the course of the year. And in so far, the majority of that swing from minus 100 to plus 18 and the other expense line is based on the currency result that should be 0 if I manage my portfolio on a very highly matched basis. So on the one hand, this is a little bit of a one-off. On the other hand, I think where we were in doubt, we stayed a little bit longer in the foreign currencies as we saw the euro weakening, especially against the U.S. dollar. This is why this line has improved so remarkably. Moreover, I think other components here is the fee income on those contracts from -- on the Life side, which are deposit accounted, where the risk component is so low that there is no reinsurance treatment justified and the fee income is reflected in that line and that has been increasing as well. Moreover, we have been rather successful in managing our LOC costs down. Also, that is mainly on the Life side where it was possible to decrease the cost of the LOCs, which we, in the majority, need to back up our U.S. business. The tax rate is back to normal. You might remember that last year we had a special effect on the Non-Life -- on the P&C side where the deferred taxes on equalization reserves could be calculated a little bit more realistically based on the decision of German taxman that -- or that have had reduced to 90 million extraordinary effect. That, of course, was not repeated this year. We are still a little bit on the low side based on a very positive result in Bermuda where the tax rate is 0 and where our cat business is written mainly, so the contribution from the low tax environments had been a little bit over proportional, same goes for the Life business, which we write in Bermuda. So this is why the overall tax rate is a little bit lower than what we would expect for a normalized tax ratio, which should be around 25% on a group level.\r\nA brief look at the P&C side. We see a slight growth to 1.2% on a currency-adjusted basis, which is nice and which follows our guidance. Would this number have been negative that would not have been a problem at all. It is positively influenced by some low-risk, low-margin Chinese surplus relief contracts, which we sometimes write. Sometimes the margins are not sufficient. So again, it's nice to see it growing, but if that would have been a negative number, we would not be concerned at all. The burden or the net retention has increased slightly. So we pay a little bit less for our retrocessions, which makes itself felt here that the net premium income is growing a little bit more than the gross. The major losses, I think Uli has already mentioned, the large loss budget was EUR 670 million. EUR 244 million of that budget was unused. And in that regard, it was the third very large, loan large loss number in a row, which, of course, also has its impact on the competition, on the market.\r\nPerhaps and, also, that was mentioned by Uli. Let's discuss a little bit our reserving policy. If you look at the annual result and the runoff triangles, you will see a positive runoff of EUR 270 million. I think that is really fully in line with what I was trying to explain at the occasion of the Investors Day, and approximately EUR 50 million positive runoff would be expected per quarter, a little bit more than that for the year. So there are no extraordinary unusual effects on the runoff result. I would refer to my presentation at the same place, a few months ago, where I was trying to explain the impacts which could be there on the confidence level, as well as the runoff result. Nothing extraordinary here. In that regard, the combined ratio for the fourth quarter, when we read your first comments, seems to be a little bit disappointing. We, as Uli already mentioned, stuck to our reserving policy. We have most likely added and we're waiting on the final results of the reserve studies, but we will most likely have added to the reserve redundancies, which our COO always presented to you at the occasion of the Investors Day. We have to bear in mind that, also, the volume of the reserves has increased based on the currency exchange rates. So percentage-wise, we might have keep or kept the overall confidence level flat, but in absolute terms, we will have increased redundant reserves numbers, which you might remember was EUR 1.5 billion based on the last study. And that also explains a little bit, why the fourth quarter effect, which you had expected in the combined ratio has not taken place to such an extent. I think that's it.\r\nLet's look at the MtCR and the achievements of the year per market on the P&C side. The margins are getting a little bit narrower. Still, even if you back out  the very positive cat result, we would still have made it and the overall result of the business would have been still profitable. We shouldn't fool ourselves  a combined ratio of 39.3% is nothing, which we could really see also in the future. And so far, a large cat year might make the overall P&C result getting nearer to the breakeven point. And it's good to have buffers if that happens.\r\nApart from that, again, we can briefly look at the North America business, still profitable below the hurdle or above the hurdle. The Continental Europe positive, with Germany also better than it used to be. The Marine business, after the big losses Sandy, Costa Concordia, very profitable. Aviation, we know what happened there. The triple E airport, as well as the Malaysian Airline disasters, of course, hit that. Credit, surety, profitable.  U.K. London Market and Direct, we still had a little bit of problem on some casualty accounts where we were looked at conservatively. We expect that to be far better in the future. The Worldwide treaty on the edge. Cat, of course, I mentioned that very profitable and, of course, the basis for the overachievement. Structured Reinsurance, very positive and making the margin, by far. The major losses I mentioned you can see that here very clearly, 3 years in a row. And if you add all the -- under -- or those amounts for the last 3 years where we were under the budgeted large loss number, that accounts for EUR 400 million. So the EUR 426 million, what you see here as compared to the EUR 670 million, the EUR 578 million as compared to EUR 625 million. But if you then go back to the year 2011, you'll see that all this, what we have saved within -- over the last 3 years, can be gone within 1-year. And in that regard, we should always bear that in mind and not fool ourselves that the very positive results in this segment might go on forever. You see, the large losses, the single ones, not a real single one was a very major loss. On the cat side, clearly, below the budget with the Triple E -- with the storm Ela in Germany, Belgium and The Netherlands, with the highest loss burden of around EUR 50 million for our account. The Aviation claims with Triple E and the Malaysian Airline losses as I already mentioned. Overall as I mentioned, EUR 244 million below our budget.\r\nSo another friendly cat picture, although not a glamorous picture. If we look at the Life and Health reinsurance, we did various longevity deals. We took benefit from the improved and the hardening rates in Australia and these were the major profit drivers. We did recede some of, especially the longevity deals, and this is why the net retention goes down. On the technical side, Uli mentioned that the Australian DII business did really well, fully in line with our expectations, even slightly better. So that explains the improvement here. The U.S. mortality still slightly below our expectations, but no better prices here as well. And this is then the basis for the remarkable improvement. The other income here, also, is usually better than in the -- on the P&C side. It did benefit, also, from currency exchange rates, but here even, also, from the fee income of our deposited accounting, especially the financial reinsurance contracts, which have improved as I mentioned before. Margin-wise, I think we are rather happy, Financial Solutions, impressive margins that is the business we especially write in the U.S. where our colleagues do provide coverage for the balance sheet or for the local balance sheet, especially and that is improving and growing nicely. The longevity also over and above the target. The mortality and morbidity business, as I mentioned, the U.S. mortality business, some of that business is still not fully in line with our expectations. And here we can come back to that one U.S. house contract, morbidity project, which we no longer write when we looked at reserves and increased the reserves or incurred some losses, especially in the fourth quarter. We, again, we no longer write that business. So this will not recur. And this is also the reason as to why we look very positive into the future. Even better news if we turn the page and have a very, very brief look at the MCEV. That is hot off the press. For the first time we managed to present the Market Consistent Embedded Value numbers together with our year-end results. And we have demonstrated or in our presentation only the major numbers you will find the details. If you're interested, if you believe in MCEVs, then you will find the numbers in the Appendix and on the website, especially the very brand-new website of Hannover Re, which I think is worth visiting anyway. The MCEV has increased by 16% and is now nearly EUR 4.3 billion. I think even more importantly, the value of new business is for 3 or even 4 years in a row, now on a very high level over and above our threshold of the target markets with EUR 448 million. Again, another new record. Again, this is profit which we will earn, also, long-term up until 20 years, 30 years. Still, with more than EUR 1 billion of new business value over the last 3 years, we are very confident that also the IFRS result will improve remarkably in the next years to come. Perhaps not mentioned on this page but still important is the MCEV or Market Consistent Embedded Value not recognized on the balance sheet. That increased from 1,10,000,000 to 1.12 billion, which is also an increase of more than EUR 100 million. And again, if you believe in MCEV numbers, that is another off-balance sheet value, which Hannover Re carries.\r\nSo to come to the investment side, the ROE target, from my point of view, as I'm responsible for that segment, of course, I look at that even a little bit closer. It is a little bit underrepresented or underestimated when we show it here. It includes the technical derivatives, which you see as the changing for value of financial instruments, that is the ModCo derivatives, as well as the inflation swaps. If we back that out, what we do on our target matrix always, the positives and the negatives, we end up at 3.3 ROI and which is a little bit over and above our target. If I come back very briefly to the impact of our subordinated bond redemption and reinvestment, so here we do calculate with the assets beginning of the year, assets end of the year, divide that by 2. Of course, the 7 months where I didn't have that money are not included in that, so also, that is a little bit the reason why the numbers here are a little bit underrepresented. The realized gains and losses, again, Uli mentioned that already, we had some turnover in the portfolio, which created these losses. Apart from that, there were no real surprises. Impairments and appreciations, driven by regular depreciations on the real estate portfolio. So again, nothing extraordinary to write-off. And with nearly EUR 1.1 billion net investment income, we are happy, and again, it is a little bit more than we had expected. \r\nIt is interesting to look at the bottom of that page, what happened to our valuation reserves. I had addressed that already various times. We have now here, the on balance sheet valuation reserves. These are -- those of the investments we have, we account for at available for sale. The off-balance sheet values that is what we have as hold to maturity or what -- which [indiscernible] or others, which we do account at amortized cost. Altogether, that number has doubled from EUR 1.1 billion to EUR 2.2 billion -- more than EUR 2.2 billion -- or nearly EUR 2.3 billion. And we have not taken advantage of that by realizing more. That is a buffer for the potential yield increases in the future.\r\nA brief look and final look before I ask Uli to present to you the outlook. The asset allocation, that is rather stable. The corporate portfolio has increased to 35%, a little bit more, there's nothing more to be expected. The front -- covered bonds have gone down a little bit here. A competitive investor, especially by the end of last year was there with ease at beak[indiscernible] also, competing to buy these issues. So that has come down a little bit, as also the prices went down remarkably. The real estate is developing as well as the private equity. So we keep these portions stable and it's -- and we will hear in a second that with the reinvestment yields we do invest today, our amounts of around 1.7, 1.8. The expectations for the next year is around 3.1% ROI with increased assets under own management. We estimate the return from the net or the net investment income, again in the range of the previous year.\r\nI think with that, I conclude my details. And, Uli, the floor is yours with the target matrix.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Roland. Okay, target matrix. This year, I'm happy to show it to you because it looks nicer than most years. You can see that we have achieved all group targets, including the earnings per share target with 10.1%, that's quite reinsuring. Then I maybe mention the EBIT margin on the P&C side, the 17%, shows that this business continues to be rather profitable. And you can also see that the economic targets, which are the xRoCA targets, we have achieved comfortably on both of our business groups. \r\nWith that, enough about 2014. Let's look into 2015. First of all, P&C business, we have come off a pretty good start into 2015. The 1/1/2015 renewal was a little bit more favorable than we expected. I mean, we could keep the rates pretty well in many cases, and we also managed to slightly increase the volume. I can also say that the business opportunities for new business are actually quite good. So we have a good deal flow of new business coming in. I would, however, say that this is almost exclusively from existing clients where we have a good position as the go-to reinsurer. \r\nIf I then look at the 3 segments: target markets, specialty lines and worldwide reinsurance. On the target markets, we see good growth in North America at a good margin, particularly in the U.S., where we have more than 600 clients. So writing larger shares with these clients and being involved in their new reinsurance purchasing, which we occasionally do. We see good prospects here. Continental Europe is a little bit a mixed picture. Parts like France and some other Continental European countries like Spain, for example, rather competitive. And of course, volume trending downwards due to selective underwriting. On the other hand, if you look at Germany, for example, still -- I mean, the underlying profitability trend is very positive. And being one of the larger markets in Germany, we benefit from that, particular when it comes to the bottom line.\r\nOn the specialty lines, all the business at this point in time is very competitive. So for us, the emphasis is entirely and only on the bottom line. We feel that we have significant businesses there, we're particular on the non-proportionate side, still offers us good opportunity for profit. But discipline is extremely important here. On the marine side, I mean, rates have come down a bit. But overall, they're still a profitable business. And same is true for credit and surety, where we achieved the #2 position in the market in 2010. And this, of course, helps us now that the business have become a lot more profitable -- sorry, a lot more competitive after good profitability in previous years.\r\nOf course, business closes to my heart is aviation. Unfortunately, I can't see a lot of good things about it, because despite the losses, the market continues to be actually quite competitive. On the U.K. and Ireland business, as well as on the facultative business, we see some growth again after having retrenched on the U.K. business last year, and we also see improved profitability there. Worldwide treaty is, I mean, we see reduced premium on the cat site, which is not fully showing here. However, the exposure is still unchanged, even slightly up, but the rates are coming down. So again, a conservative underwriting is important.\r\nOn the worldwide treaty, we see plenty of opportunities in the emerging markets, particular Asia, India and China to be mentioned, but also on the agricultural business, which, with what we have written recently, we can clearly see that we will have further double-digit growth on the agricultural business. Also on the structured reinsurance and the ILS business, I mean, we see good growth opportunities, partly already materialized in the first 2.5 months of the year. So all in all, we are relatively, cautiously optimistic on our P&C business for the current year, even a little bit more positive than I would have been standing here, say, 3 months ago.\r\nOn the Life & Health side, again, the emphasis is clearly on profitability, which we expect that we could further improve. Particular positive is financial lines business where we have already quite positive trend, and you would see that when we report our first quarter results. We already have said early on, longevity, while this is -- we haven't got a new transaction so far this year -- well, maybe one, a slightly larger one. But we are working on a few others. Market has become a little bit more competitive because -- I mean, most of the reinsurers are competing for that business now. So, again, we take a rather conservative stance, looking for the right deals and not for the volume.\r\nOn the mortality, I mean, we have actually seen good profitability also in 2014, and that is also including the ING portfolio that put the whole thing together. We expect continued rise of profitability in that market. I think we will be able to further improve, which means not make it profitable but make it less negative, our ING book. And of course, the new business that we produced in the U.S. still shows positive volumes, actual to expected. So overall, that should be fine. On the morbidity where we have seen negative results, we believe that we also should see an improvement in Australia. Where on the group business, we have very, very significant increases on the TBD [ph] exposure from that business. So all in all, we are quite positive on the prospects for our Life & Health business in 2015. \r\nThat brings me to the guidance, which we left unchanged. We believe that our volume will be at stable interest rates. I hastened to add stable to low-single-digit growth, a little bit like we have seen in 2014. Of course, if you look at that in euro terms, you see current interest rates prevail. You will see some more meaningful growth in euro terms on that business. Return on investment, 3%. Roland already mentioned that. However, on a higher volume of investments and EUR 875 million group net income guidance, we left that unchanged compared to what we told you when we reported our third quarter numbers of 2014. We believe that on stable interest rates, that's pretty much the underlying profitability that our business currently shows, projected with a degree of caution. And therefore, we left it unchanged.\r\nIf you look at the dividend guidance, this is really our standard dividend guidance, which we developed some many years ago where we said, yes, we want to pay out a fair amount of our IFRS profit, but we also want to keep sufficient profit in the company to self-finance our growth. There's a recent development of the capital, of course we have deviated from that remarkably in 2014. Of course, if everything stays equal and -- I mean, the excess capital position remains equal or even slightly increases, the business opportunities stay equal, meaning, that we still have a soft market and the competitive market and has been no major turmoil in the financial markets. Then of course the situation is exactly what we have seen for 2014. And it is probably fair to assume that we will act similarly than we have done in 2014. But that, of course, is only if the situation in 12 months' time looks similar to what it currently looks, and we haven't got a crystal ball and a lot can happen between now and year-end. \r\nWith that, I would conclude the presentation. Almost -- I almost forgot the most important slide of the entire presentation, but of course, by switching the slides that kind of reminded me rather swiftly, this are still pretty much unchanged, the reasons why we are quite bullish for our profit guidance and the prospects for 2015. First, we believe, as I explained, further improvement and increase of the bottom line of our Life & Health business. Secondly, despite the soft market and the structural soft market from a supply and demand point of view on the P&C side, we believe that we can keep our underwriting profit pretty stable. That also goes for the combined ratio, provided that the large losses stay within the budget. Reason, we feel that the quality of the business that we have remains good.\r\nSecondly, the buffers on the sufficiency level of the loss reserves remain intact or even slightly better than 12 months ago. And the retrocession program has seen more favorable terms than 12 months ago. And that if you put it all together, should result into a continued favorable underwriting result from our P&C side. I would, however, say that on the retrocessions, I'd say terms have improved, that does not mean that we see negative margins. If we have the expected loss level, we still see the margin to our retrocession. Then on the investment side, in absolute terms, we feel that the earnings from asset under management should be quite stable. In relative terms, of course, coming down. And then we will keep our competitive advantage due to our low admin expense ratio, which we work hard that we will continue to see that. \r\nWith that, however, that concludes our presentations. And we are more than happy to answer your questions.",

Roland Vogel, our CFO, will then move on to present the financials in detail. Afterwards, we will be happy to respond at length to all your questions you might have. And I would like to point out that you are kindly asked to wait for the microphone so that everybody can understand your question, even those who are not in the room.\r\nOn that note, I'm delighted to hand over to Ulrich Wallin.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Ulrich Wallin (Executives)】\nYes, good afternoon, and welcome to our presentation of our 2014 results. I will kick it off. I will also finish it off with the outlook for the coming year.\r\nWell, I mean, 2014 for us was quite a good year, I would say. I mean, as you can see, we managed to increase the after-tax earnings of the group by more than 10% and this has been driven by a strong underlying earnings from all segments so that we could continue our rather conservative policy when it comes to reserves, be it on the P&C side or be it on the Life & Health side. So from that point of view, we didn't need to be aggressive on any of the various items of the profit and loss account and the balance sheet in order to generate this increased profitability.\r\nWe also decided to increase the dividend via a special dividend of EUR 1.25 together with the ordinary dividend of EUR 3 to EUR 4.25. And this is due to the fact that our capital grew rather remarkably by 28.2%, and then of course, which means that the excess capital also has increased. And of course, the ROE for the current year would be a little bit more stressed so that it was the right time to start with the capital management for Hannover Re, which we already announced at our last Investor Day.\r\nYou can see that the business continues to grow, even though at a lower pace, due to the rather challenging market on the P&C side, whereas well publicized the competition has increased quite significantly. But nonetheless, as the business continues to grow both the P&C business, as well as the Life & Health business. As already mentioned, the bottom line grew more pronounced as compared to the top line with almost 20% growth of the EBIT compared to last year and as already mentioned, 10.1% of the after-tax earnings.\r\nDespite the significant growth of the capital, the ROE is still at a quite acceptable level with 14.7%. So we continue to enjoy attractive ROEs. If we then look at individual business groups, overall, as the Property & Casualty business, we are happy. I mean, we think development has been positive. EBIT grew by 12.2%. Admittedly, one might say that the combined ratio, particularly in the fourth quarter, some of you might have expected a slightly lower combined ratio. On the other hand, we are quite happy with the after-tax result of the P&C business group and we were also quite pleased that we could keep with our conservative loss reserving policy, which is the result, of course, of the quality of the underlying business. But also, and that shouldn't be forgotten, of the fact that the large losses came in well within the budget and this, of course, means there was no pressure or deviation of pressure to the combined ratio from the large loss site, which really pretty much offset the pressure on the combined ratio, of course, there from the reduced rates, which we see as a result of the current soft market. So therefore, we could keep the loss reserving policy rather unchanged, a little bit better than we actually had expected.\r\nWith the Life & Health business, I'm quite pleased that the earnings have actually increased, the EBIT increased by 75% and also, we had a 25% increase of the post-tax earnings. This is in line which -- what we are trying to tell you since quite some while, certainly, since the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2013. This year, this was still an easy target to have because our 2013 numbers, of course, were depressed due to the additional reserves that we put on the DII business, which we luckily can say now seem to be a conservative. So what really happened in 2014 as the results normalized. I mean they're not terribly exciting, but they are more to the normal level that we expect from our Life & Health business. I would say the technical result, particular in the fourth quarter, a little bit below what we're expecting. Again partly, I mean, conservative reserving on the enhanced annuities, partly negative deviation of the actual to expected on the ING portfolio. So but, overall, I mean, pretty much in line with expectation for 2014, as a whole year. But -- I mean, everything has a positive as well. I mean, if you look forward to 2015, we feel that there is room for -- through the improvement of the results of Life & Health.\r\nWe were very happy all together with the investment results, ordinary income app[indiscernible], which is quite remarkable considering the rather low interest rates environment that we are wrestling with. Here again, I mean, the increase in volume helped significantly. Also, it turned out to be a quite favorable for us that we changed the functional currency of Bermuda subsidiaries at the end of 2013 from euros to U.S. dollar because in restructuring the portfolio of around EUR 1.4 billion at the time into U.S. dollars, of course, if you have meant that we had to sell euro securities, which resulted in realized gains. And at the same time, the new investment in U.S. dollars were down at a time when the interest rates in U.S. dollars had a little spike. So even on those investments we already have realized gains. And also the running yields in U.S. dollars was slightly higher than in euros, particular since recently the -- is at the year started some new experiments with the euro currency. So overall, we were very pleased with our investment income.\r\nThis is the broad overview of what we see for 2014. The finer details, Roland will explain to you in great detail. Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Roland Vogel (Executives)】\nThank you, Uli. I think you mentioned already some parts of -- or the major parts of our key figures and results. But I think we should start with, before we get into the detailed P&L, we should look at some key metrics or remarkable developments of key metrics, which were not only driven by us, but also by the markets or the ease it be[indiscernible] or whomsoever. First of all, the strong cash flow for 2014, nearly reached the 2 billion mark again. We started a little bit slow into the year. I think we mentioned at previous occasions that there was one U.S. mobility contract. And we might come to that contract, again a little bit later, which was cash negative in the first 2 quarters. This will turn around. It has already. And it will turn around in 2015. So we will get that money back, but the second half year, with very strong cash flow, which I think supports the positive message and the quality of the results even with a little bit of more depressed overall growth, the cash flow stays very positive.\r\nOn the right-hand side, the assets under own management up by 14% or EUR 4.5 billion. I can tell you with the development of the U.S. dollar and the yields, especially the yields of the government bonds, this, today, is approaching EUR 39 billion. So the increase is really remarkable. And again, this is not only driven by a very good result, but also the yields and especially the currency exchange rates.\r\nThe same goes for the capital position on the next slide. Equity increased by nearly EUR 1.7 billion or 28%, the policyholder surplus by EUR 1.5 billion. Why is that a little bit different? Because we paid back EUR 750 million in February and we issued the subordinated bond, and we issued a new subordinated bond in September with another EUR 500 million, which then again, was the reason why the policyholder surplus decreased order. Subordinated bonds here decreased a little bit. You might remember there is another call date coming up in June for EUR 500 million. Up to now, we indicated that the last EUR 500 million was already an early refinancing. This is not an announcement that we will call that up to now we have called every subordinated bond at its first call date. So one might expect that this green part of the bar might go down in June. On the other side of that slide, you see the increase in the shareholders' equity. And I think that demonstrates very clearly, where this increase is -- strong increase is coming from. First of all, of course, EUR 986 million of result. The dividend we paid last year was the EUR 362 million. And that demonstrates that the increase coming from the valuation reserves on our invested assets, as well as the currency exchange rates. This is more than EUR 1 billion and it's even higher than what we had produced as profits. Now you might want to distinguish these 2 components for the increased or the increased assets from the currency exchange rates. I think this is also reflected on the earnings side by higher U.S. dollar, Aussie dollar, whatever, earnings. So we earn also higher euro values on these amounts. When you look at the valuation reserves, the more than EUR 630 million in the middle that is an increase, which is really an increase in our capital base, which also will have an impact on the future ROIs. The overall number of OCI or capital driven by market -- by the valuation reserves in our asset portfolio is 1.5 -- EUR 1.2 billion, nearly. And with a modified duration of 5 years, one could expect everything equal. We might lose EUR 120 million per year because this will run off. This will be capital components, which will disappear in the future, but it's only EUR 120 million per year.\r\nI think this leads us directly into the capital management actions, which Uli had already mentioned. Here, you see a -- from my point of view, impressive picture. If you look at the last 6 years, 6 years ago, we came here and mentioned that it is our intention to decrease the volatility in our earnings, to decrease the volatility in our dividend payments. And if you look at that picture here, you'll see that we were rather successful, of course, helped by the markets and also the catastrophe components in our business. But even in 2011, which was the second highest natural catastrophe burden in the history of the insurance, we managed to provide a good dividend. The EUR 3-plus, the bonus do represent EUR 150 million. So that is what we kind of give back to our shareholders as a start of -- potential capital management action. The dividend yield today or a few days ago, 5%; if you go back to the beginning of the year, 6%; if you go back 1-year and you had invested into Hannover Re share 1-year ago, the dividend yield would even be above 7%.\r\nOne other perspective at the capital development and the ROEs we have provided and do provide. I think the chart demonstrates clearly the achievement. The average capital position has been increasing remarkably from the EUR 4 billion to the EUR 6.7 billion this year. Still we managed to keep the ROE on a very, very high level. On the right-hand side you see the average achievements. On the left-hand side, the last 5 years. The margins over or above the hurdle and we have shown here the old total, the 750 basis points, as well as the new hurdle, the 900 basis points has even increased over the last years, but we have to bear in mind that this has got to be more challenging in the future, with the high capital position and with also the higher volatile capital components. I have tried to explain to you with the OCI positions, which might be volatile in the future. So this is going to be more challenging into the future and this is why we also look at managing the capital position, as well as the income position up there.\r\nI think that -- then leads us directly into the peer comparison, which we always do. I think we are still the #1 on the 4-year horizon. This year, 2 Bermudan companies are in front of us. I think that is not very surprising because of the very low cap burden, which the industry has been seeing. So in that regard, we are still happy and we are still committed to stay one of the most profitable reinsurers in the industry, also, in the future.\r\nSo let's then have a brief look at the P&L in more detail. On the group level, I think it's not necessary to repeat the growth of the turnover of the premium. The first component I think which needs some explanation is the other income and expense line here. We have been long in the U.S. dollar and the -- in other non-euro currencies already over the course of the year. And in so far, the majority of that swing from minus 100 to plus 18 and the other expense line is based on the currency result that should be 0 if I manage my portfolio on a very highly matched basis. So on the one hand, this is a little bit of a one-off. On the other hand, I think where we were in doubt, we stayed a little bit longer in the foreign currencies as we saw the euro weakening, especially against the U.S. dollar. This is why this line has improved so remarkably. Moreover, I think other components here is the fee income on those contracts from -- on the Life side, which are deposit accounted, where the risk component is so low that there is no reinsurance treatment justified and the fee income is reflected in that line and that has been increasing as well. Moreover, we have been rather successful in managing our LOC costs down. Also, that is mainly on the Life side where it was possible to decrease the cost of the LOCs, which we, in the majority, need to back up our U.S. business. The tax rate is back to normal. You might remember that last year we had a special effect on the Non-Life -- on the P&C side where the deferred taxes on equalization reserves could be calculated a little bit more realistically based on the decision of German taxman that -- or that have had reduced to 90 million extraordinary effect. That, of course, was not repeated this year. We are still a little bit on the low side based on a very positive result in Bermuda where the tax rate is 0 and where our cat business is written mainly, so the contribution from the low tax environments had been a little bit over proportional, same goes for the Life business, which we write in Bermuda. So this is why the overall tax rate is a little bit lower than what we would expect for a normalized tax ratio, which should be around 25% on a group level.\r\nA brief look at the P&C side. We see a slight growth to 1.2% on a currency-adjusted basis, which is nice and which follows our guidance. Would this number have been negative that would not have been a problem at all. It is positively influenced by some low-risk, low-margin Chinese surplus relief contracts, which we sometimes write. Sometimes the margins are not sufficient. So again, it's nice to see it growing, but if that would have been a negative number, we would not be concerned at all. The burden or the net retention has increased slightly. So we pay a little bit less for our retrocessions, which makes itself felt here that the net premium income is growing a little bit more than the gross. The major losses, I think Uli has already mentioned, the large loss budget was EUR 670 million. EUR 244 million of that budget was unused. And in that regard, it was the third very large, loan large loss number in a row, which, of course, also has its impact on the competition, on the market.\r\nPerhaps and, also, that was mentioned by Uli. Let's discuss a little bit our reserving policy. If you look at the annual result and the runoff triangles, you will see a positive runoff of EUR 270 million. I think that is really fully in line with what I was trying to explain at the occasion of the Investors Day, and approximately EUR 50 million positive runoff would be expected per quarter, a little bit more than that for the year. So there are no extraordinary unusual effects on the runoff result. I would refer to my presentation at the same place, a few months ago, where I was trying to explain the impacts which could be there on the confidence level, as well as the runoff result. Nothing extraordinary here. In that regard, the combined ratio for the fourth quarter, when we read your first comments, seems to be a little bit disappointing. We, as Uli already mentioned, stuck to our reserving policy. We have most likely added and we're waiting on the final results of the reserve studies, but we will most likely have added to the reserve redundancies, which our COO always presented to you at the occasion of the Investors Day. We have to bear in mind that, also, the volume of the reserves has increased based on the currency exchange rates. So percentage-wise, we might have keep or kept the overall confidence level flat, but in absolute terms, we will have increased redundant reserves numbers, which you might remember was EUR 1.5 billion based on the last study. And that also explains a little bit, why the fourth quarter effect, which you had expected in the combined ratio has not taken place to such an extent. I think that's it.\r\nLet's look at the MtCR and the achievements of the year per market on the P&C side. The margins are getting a little bit narrower. Still, even if you back out  the very positive cat result, we would still have made it and the overall result of the business would have been still profitable. We shouldn't fool ourselves  a combined ratio of 39.3% is nothing, which we could really see also in the future. And so far, a large cat year might make the overall P&C result getting nearer to the breakeven point. And it's good to have buffers if that happens.\r\nApart from that, again, we can briefly look at the North America business, still profitable below the hurdle or above the hurdle. The Continental Europe positive, with Germany also better than it used to be. The Marine business, after the big losses Sandy, Costa Concordia, very profitable. Aviation, we know what happened there. The triple E airport, as well as the Malaysian Airline disasters, of course, hit that. Credit, surety, profitable.  U.K. London Market and Direct, we still had a little bit of problem on some casualty accounts where we were looked at conservatively. We expect that to be far better in the future. The Worldwide treaty on the edge. Cat, of course, I mentioned that very profitable and, of course, the basis for the overachievement. Structured Reinsurance, very positive and making the margin, by far. The major losses I mentioned you can see that here very clearly, 3 years in a row. And if you add all the -- under -- or those amounts for the last 3 years where we were under the budgeted large loss number, that accounts for EUR 400 million. So the EUR 426 million, what you see here as compared to the EUR 670 million, the EUR 578 million as compared to EUR 625 million. But if you then go back to the year 2011, you'll see that all this, what we have saved within -- over the last 3 years, can be gone within 1-year. And in that regard, we should always bear that in mind and not fool ourselves that the very positive results in this segment might go on forever. You see, the large losses, the single ones, not a real single one was a very major loss. On the cat side, clearly, below the budget with the Triple E -- with the storm Ela in Germany, Belgium and The Netherlands, with the highest loss burden of around EUR 50 million for our account. The Aviation claims with Triple E and the Malaysian Airline losses as I already mentioned. Overall as I mentioned, EUR 244 million below our budget.\r\nSo another friendly cat picture, although not a glamorous picture. If we look at the Life and Health reinsurance, we did various longevity deals. We took benefit from the improved and the hardening rates in Australia and these were the major profit drivers. We did recede some of, especially the longevity deals, and this is why the net retention goes down. On the technical side, Uli mentioned that the Australian DII business did really well, fully in line with our expectations, even slightly better. So that explains the improvement here. The U.S. mortality still slightly below our expectations, but no better prices here as well. And this is then the basis for the remarkable improvement. The other income here, also, is usually better than in the -- on the P&C side. It did benefit, also, from currency exchange rates, but here even, also, from the fee income of our deposited accounting, especially the financial reinsurance contracts, which have improved as I mentioned before. Margin-wise, I think we are rather happy, Financial Solutions, impressive margins that is the business we especially write in the U.S. where our colleagues do provide coverage for the balance sheet or for the local balance sheet, especially and that is improving and growing nicely. The longevity also over and above the target. The mortality and morbidity business, as I mentioned, the U.S. mortality business, some of that business is still not fully in line with our expectations. And here we can come back to that one U.S. house contract, morbidity project, which we no longer write when we looked at reserves and increased the reserves or incurred some losses, especially in the fourth quarter. We, again, we no longer write that business. So this will not recur. And this is also the reason as to why we look very positive into the future. Even better news if we turn the page and have a very, very brief look at the MCEV. That is hot off the press. For the first time we managed to present the Market Consistent Embedded Value numbers together with our year-end results. And we have demonstrated or in our presentation only the major numbers you will find the details. If you're interested, if you believe in MCEVs, then you will find the numbers in the Appendix and on the website, especially the very brand-new website of Hannover Re, which I think is worth visiting anyway. The MCEV has increased by 16% and is now nearly EUR 4.3 billion. I think even more importantly, the value of new business is for 3 or even 4 years in a row, now on a very high level over and above our threshold of the target markets with EUR 448 million. Again, another new record. Again, this is profit which we will earn, also, long-term up until 20 years, 30 years. Still, with more than EUR 1 billion of new business value over the last 3 years, we are very confident that also the IFRS result will improve remarkably in the next years to come. Perhaps not mentioned on this page but still important is the MCEV or Market Consistent Embedded Value not recognized on the balance sheet. That increased from 1,10,000,000 to 1.12 billion, which is also an increase of more than EUR 100 million. And again, if you believe in MCEV numbers, that is another off-balance sheet value, which Hannover Re carries.\r\nSo to come to the investment side, the ROE target, from my point of view, as I'm responsible for that segment, of course, I look at that even a little bit closer. It is a little bit underrepresented or underestimated when we show it here. It includes the technical derivatives, which you see as the changing for value of financial instruments, that is the ModCo derivatives, as well as the inflation swaps. If we back that out, what we do on our target matrix always, the positives and the negatives, we end up at 3.3 ROI and which is a little bit over and above our target. If I come back very briefly to the impact of our subordinated bond redemption and reinvestment, so here we do calculate with the assets beginning of the year, assets end of the year, divide that by 2. Of course, the 7 months where I didn't have that money are not included in that, so also, that is a little bit the reason why the numbers here are a little bit underrepresented. The realized gains and losses, again, Uli mentioned that already, we had some turnover in the portfolio, which created these losses. Apart from that, there were no real surprises. Impairments and appreciations, driven by regular depreciations on the real estate portfolio. So again, nothing extraordinary to write-off. And with nearly EUR 1.1 billion net investment income, we are happy, and again, it is a little bit more than we had expected. \r\nIt is interesting to look at the bottom of that page, what happened to our valuation reserves. I had addressed that already various times. We have now here, the on balance sheet valuation reserves. These are -- those of the investments we have, we account for at available for sale. The off-balance sheet values that is what we have as hold to maturity or what -- which [indiscernible] or others, which we do account at amortized cost. Altogether, that number has doubled from EUR 1.1 billion to EUR 2.2 billion -- more than EUR 2.2 billion -- or nearly EUR 2.3 billion. And we have not taken advantage of that by realizing more. That is a buffer for the potential yield increases in the future.\r\nA brief look and final look before I ask Uli to present to you the outlook. The asset allocation, that is rather stable. The corporate portfolio has increased to 35%, a little bit more, there's nothing more to be expected. The front -- covered bonds have gone down a little bit here. A competitive investor, especially by the end of last year was there with ease at beak[indiscernible] also, competing to buy these issues. So that has come down a little bit, as also the prices went down remarkably. The real estate is developing as well as the private equity. So we keep these portions stable and it's -- and we will hear in a second that with the reinvestment yields we do invest today, our amounts of around 1.7, 1.8. The expectations for the next year is around 3.1% ROI with increased assets under own management. We estimate the return from the net or the net investment income, again in the range of the previous year.\r\nI think with that, I conclude my details. And, Uli, the floor is yours with the target matrix.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Ulrich Wallin (Executives)】\nThank you, Roland. Okay, target matrix. This year, I'm happy to show it to you because it looks nicer than most years. You can see that we have achieved all group targets, including the earnings per share target with 10.1%, that's quite reinsuring. Then I maybe mention the EBIT margin on the P&C side, the 17%, shows that this business continues to be rather profitable. And you can also see that the economic targets, which are the xRoCA targets, we have achieved comfortably on both of our business groups. \r\nWith that, enough about 2014. Let's look into 2015. First of all, P&C business, we have come off a pretty good start into 2015. The 1/1/2015 renewal was a little bit more favorable than we expected. I mean, we could keep the rates pretty well in many cases, and we also managed to slightly increase the volume. I can also say that the business opportunities for new business are actually quite good. So we have a good deal flow of new business coming in. I would, however, say that this is almost exclusively from existing clients where we have a good position as the go-to reinsurer. \r\nIf I then look at the 3 segments: target markets, specialty lines and worldwide reinsurance. On the target markets, we see good growth in North America at a good margin, particularly in the U.S., where we have more than 600 clients. So writing larger shares with these clients and being involved in their new reinsurance purchasing, which we occasionally do. We see good prospects here. Continental Europe is a little bit a mixed picture. Parts like France and some other Continental European countries like Spain, for example, rather competitive. And of course, volume trending downwards due to selective underwriting. On the other hand, if you look at Germany, for example, still -- I mean, the underlying profitability trend is very positive. And being one of the larger markets in Germany, we benefit from that, particular when it comes to the bottom line.\r\nOn the specialty lines, all the business at this point in time is very competitive. So for us, the emphasis is entirely and only on the bottom line. We feel that we have significant businesses there, we're particular on the non-proportionate side, still offers us good opportunity for profit. But discipline is extremely important here. On the marine side, I mean, rates have come down a bit. But overall, they're still a profitable business. And same is true for credit and surety, where we achieved the #2 position in the market in 2010. And this, of course, helps us now that the business have become a lot more profitable -- sorry, a lot more competitive after good profitability in previous years.\r\nOf course, business closes to my heart is aviation. Unfortunately, I can't see a lot of good things about it, because despite the losses, the market continues to be actually quite competitive. On the U.K. and Ireland business, as well as on the facultative business, we see some growth again after having retrenched on the U.K. business last year, and we also see improved profitability there. Worldwide treaty is, I mean, we see reduced premium on the cat site, which is not fully showing here. However, the exposure is still unchanged, even slightly up, but the rates are coming down. So again, a conservative underwriting is important.\r\nOn the worldwide treaty, we see plenty of opportunities in the emerging markets, particular Asia, India and China to be mentioned, but also on the agricultural business, which, with what we have written recently, we can clearly see that we will have further double-digit growth on the agricultural business. Also on the structured reinsurance and the ILS business, I mean, we see good growth opportunities, partly already materialized in the first 2.5 months of the year. So all in all, we are relatively, cautiously optimistic on our P&C business for the current year, even a little bit more positive than I would have been standing here, say, 3 months ago.\r\nOn the Life & Health side, again, the emphasis is clearly on profitability, which we expect that we could further improve. Particular positive is financial lines business where we have already quite positive trend, and you would see that when we report our first quarter results. We already have said early on, longevity, while this is -- we haven't got a new transaction so far this year -- well, maybe one, a slightly larger one. But we are working on a few others. Market has become a little bit more competitive because -- I mean, most of the reinsurers are competing for that business now. So, again, we take a rather conservative stance, looking for the right deals and not for the volume.\r\nOn the mortality, I mean, we have actually seen good profitability also in 2014, and that is also including the ING portfolio that put the whole thing together. We expect continued rise of profitability in that market. I think we will be able to further improve, which means not make it profitable but make it less negative, our ING book. And of course, the new business that we produced in the U.S. still shows positive volumes, actual to expected. So overall, that should be fine. On the morbidity where we have seen negative results, we believe that we also should see an improvement in Australia. Where on the group business, we have very, very significant increases on the TBD [ph] exposure from that business. So all in all, we are quite positive on the prospects for our Life & Health business in 2015. \r\nThat brings me to the guidance, which we left unchanged. We believe that our volume will be at stable interest rates. I hastened to add stable to low-single-digit growth, a little bit like we have seen in 2014. Of course, if you look at that in euro terms, you see current interest rates prevail. You will see some more meaningful growth in euro terms on that business. Return on investment, 3%. Roland already mentioned that. However, on a higher volume of investments and EUR 875 million group net income guidance, we left that unchanged compared to what we told you when we reported our third quarter numbers of 2014. We believe that on stable interest rates, that's pretty much the underlying profitability that our business currently shows, projected with a degree of caution. And therefore, we left it unchanged.\r\nIf you look at the dividend guidance, this is really our standard dividend guidance, which we developed some many years ago where we said, yes, we want to pay out a fair amount of our IFRS profit, but we also want to keep sufficient profit in the company to self-finance our growth. There's a recent development of the capital, of course we have deviated from that remarkably in 2014. Of course, if everything stays equal and -- I mean, the excess capital position remains equal or even slightly increases, the business opportunities stay equal, meaning, that we still have a soft market and the competitive market and has been no major turmoil in the financial markets. Then of course the situation is exactly what we have seen for 2014. And it is probably fair to assume that we will act similarly than we have done in 2014. But that, of course, is only if the situation in 12 months' time looks similar to what it currently looks, and we haven't got a crystal ball and a lot can happen between now and year-end. \r\nWith that, I would conclude the presentation. Almost -- I almost forgot the most important slide of the entire presentation, but of course, by switching the slides that kind of reminded me rather swiftly, this are still pretty much unchanged, the reasons why we are quite bullish for our profit guidance and the prospects for 2015. First, we believe, as I explained, further improvement and increase of the bottom line of our Life & Health business. Secondly, despite the soft market and the structural soft market from a supply and demand point of view on the P&C side, we believe that we can keep our underwriting profit pretty stable. That also goes for the combined ratio, provided that the large losses stay within the budget. Reason, we feel that the quality of the business that we have remains good.\r\nSecondly, the buffers on the sufficiency level of the loss reserves remain intact or even slightly better than 12 months ago. And the retrocession program has seen more favorable terms than 12 months ago. And that if you put it all together, should result into a continued favorable underwriting result from our P&C side. I would, however, say that on the retrocessions, I'd say terms have improved, that does not mean that we see negative margins. If we have the expected loss level, we still see the margin to our retrocession. Then on the investment side, in absolute terms, we feel that the earnings from asset under management should be quite stable. In relative terms, of course, coming down. And then we will keep our competitive advantage due to our low admin expense ratio, which we work hard that we will continue to see that. \r\nWith that, however, that concludes our presentations. And we are more than happy to answer your questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "Well, thank you much. We will now begin with our question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] We will proceed to take the questions from the participants here in the room first, and then switch to the questions coming from the conference call. I already see some hands up. And we start with the right-hand side with Ben.\n\n---\n\nBen Cohen at Canaccord Genuity. Two questions, please. Firstly, in terms of the special dividend that you're paying, could you just say a bit more as to how you arrived at the size that special? It seems to me that you actually could've done more to help support the ROE if you still have that 13% target into 2015. My second question, your share price is up, I think, 50% since we last saw you here in October, or whenever it was. In terms of that re-rating, is there anything strategically that you think that gives you more firepower to do? Would you feel that, that could be some benefit to use that multiple, maybe in terms of M&A or anything else strategically? That'll be helpful.\n\n---\n\nYes. Thank you very much, Ben, for those questions. I should press the button here, Okay, but I find mic's on anyhow. If not so much of the problem. I mean, on the dividend, the EUR 4.25 was really driven by our German GAAP earnings, which we, of course, steer towards that level. We felt that this is, I mean, a good dividend. It's about, I mean, 50%, a little bit more than 50% of our IFRS earnings. And we felt that, that would reflect the underlying strengthening of the capital relatively well. Could we have done more? Sure, you always can do more. However, we felt that it was a good level. Of course, I mean, that would still make it rather challenging to keep the ROE at the level you mentioned for 2015, but we have to see what else we can do there. On the share price using it for M&A, well, I mean, it's of course quite tempting, I would say, because the value was pretty good. It's a bit difficult to do that with our anchor shareholder tailings [ph] was 50.2% on the basis that we -- as we strategically want to keep the majority in Hannover Re.\n\n---\n\nOkay. We continue with Kamran and switch then to Roger [ph].\n\n---\n\nIt's Kamran Hossain from RBC. Two questions. The first one is just -- I guess, just coming back to M&A. So we've seen a recently announced merger in Bermuda, where we're going to get the fifth or -- fourth, fifth or sixth largest reinsurance player in the market being created, depending on whose numbers you use. Do you expect to see any disruption from this merger? I mean, I guess given their distribution using both is pretty heavily versus your distribution. And the second question is just on your comments about the improved retrocession program. So you've improved the program year-on-year, should we expect the catastrophe loss ratio as a proportion of your net earned premium to actually come down in the future as a result of this?\n\n---\n\nThe loss -- for which loss ratio?\n\n---\n\nThe catastrophe.\n\n---\n\nOh, yes. Okay. Okay, if I first come to the question on M&A, that we have seen in Bermuda I mean, to the extent that, that is reinsurance driven, we see that marginally positive for us because it means that there is one competitor less. And I mean, on the latest one, both are very respectable reinsurance players. I mean, you just have a growing [ph] panel there, there's just one left, which is marginally not -- I mean, it's not overly positive, but it's marginally positive. We do normally appreciate mergers of reinsurers. Of course, there's another aspect to it. I mean, all these merged companies, they also have a primary insurance activities where we are normally the reinsurer of. And then, of course, there is an expectation that they would, I mean, increase their retentions for reassuring their primary business. That of course means that in order to keep our volume there, we would have to increase our lines to the extent that's possible. So as you can see, it has some positive and some negative aspects. In general, I would say, we prefer reinsurers to merge than primary insurers to merge. And the question on the catastrophe loss ratio, no, that would probably stay reasonably unchanged because -- I mean, we did not change in absolute terms our risk appetite for cat. And if you buy a little bit more retro, that means that you write a little bit more growth business, because -- I mean, our risk appetite that we give us for ourselves still limits our cat writing significantly below what we would have been able to write if we would stipulate a higher risk appetite. I mean, we see that very clearly, currently, for example, in the Japanese renewals.\n\n---\n\nOkay. The next question comes from Roger Franz [ph].\n\n---\n\nYes, a couple of questions about your economic solvency ratio. That was down quite considerably from 330% to 286%, and I understand that the decline was almost entirely due to model changes. Can you please elaborate a little bit on the what kind of model changes these were? And also what the key drivers for the decline was? And whether you expect further model changes and what impact it could have until you get the approval. And finally, once the models improved, can we expect very explicit target or target range for the economic solvency?\n\n---\n\nYes, that's very correct. We did do some model changes. That was of course after discussions with our regulator where we have -- will actually hand in our application for the SAP group model for Hannover Re at the beginning of April and happen to have the meeting with BaFin tomorrow. These model changes were largely on the market risk, basically on the spread and credit risk where, up until now, the model had quite a lot of diversification between the credits and issues. And since the -- in a dialogue with the BaFin, it was felt that we share the group certain business segment closer together, which then reduces the diversification and that increased the capital requirements on that business. That really was a major change that we had. We believe that with the changes that we have done now, that would lead us through the application process for the SAP group model of Hannover Re. Of course, there will be future model changes because, I mean, you have to really look at the model on a constant basis and see if the parameters that you have put in are still, I mean, plausible and relevant, and there is, of course, the model change policies that we have. I mean, I would not expect that they will be similarly drastic. At the same time, of course, we will be looking for target solvency once the model has been approved. That is the answer to that question, really.\n\n---\n\nOkay. We continue with Andrew.\n\n---\n\nThree quick questions. One, just a follow-up on your last answer. I don't understand then why the diversification benefit on Page 84 has gone up 51%. If you've reduced the diversification, so how come the overall -- as the proportion of the gross capital requirements gone up, I think, from 32% to 36%?\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, that diversification was within the credit and spread risk was reduced. Therefore, the number -- the cat requirement for the credit and spread risk and market risk widened. But that of course meant that if you then look at the diversification with the underwriting risk, life and non-life, and the interest rate risk, then the overall risk have increased, the diversification has increased as well. That is the diversification on the entire bottom line capital requirement.\n\n---\n\nAnd the growth -- the significant growth in life and health underwriting department, is that purely volume of business driving that?\n\n---\n\nIt's -- yes, that's mostly volume actually.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And the 2 other quick questions. If I look at your life reinsurance business and your MCEV disclosure, over the last 5 years, it's been just short of EUR 800 million of negative operating variances or assumption changes related to U.S., U.K., longevity, Australian DII. You continue to express a lot of confidence in the life result improving and also in your EV translating into IFRS profit. It's a bit hard for us to kind of see that, given the amount of assumption changes and variances that have been going through. So maybe -- do you think that you need to do it in a more thorough kind of ground-up review again of assumptions? Or are we really past the worst on, particularly in the U.S.? I still find it hard to get comfortable with the outlook there. The only other question I had, I think the implication is that you've booked the unused budget on large losses. Is that how you want us to think about it, rather, as in the EUR 200-roughly million of unused. Hence, that's what's driving the sort of slight increase in reserve buffer, again?\n\n---\n\nWell, I'll leave the budget to Roland, and we'll try to give you an answer on the Life & Health side. I mean, clearly, there were negative developments on the DII, the group business and the U.S. mortality business. I mean, we feel that we take these model changes early on to be on the conservative side there. I mean, of course, in the -- sooner rather than later, we should come to a situation where the actual to expected and model changes are closer to the 0 line rather than being negative. I would expect that, for the Australian business and the Longevity business, we would not see major changes here. On the U.S. mortality business, I haven't got the same confidence as yet. So I mean, we will have to observe that. But as far as the value of new business is concerned, I mean, that has not been the -- at least the value of new business that we have created in recent years has not been the source of negative variances or negative model changes. This has been more business that has been written quite a long time ago or has been acquired with the ING transaction. So I would say, with the underwriting changes that we made in 2009, at least we haven't dug us new holes, let's put it that way.\n\n---\n\nAnd, maybe, perhaps, a short comment on the MCEV. We, I think, for a few years already, mentioned that very openly that we really follow the guidance of the CFO forum, which I'm a member of, very, very strictly. So also, when other  company may be adjusted their way of calculating financial options and guarantees or whatsoever, we really stuck to the methodology, so there is no smoothing, no addressing. So we follow these things. And as the overall numbers are really positive, we look also, I would say, conservatively or very strictly on the guidance, which led to what you felt is, in cumulative terms, an amount of adjustment, which affects credibility a little bit, I think, but it is also a reflection of us really following the rules very strictly. Coming back on the unused budgets, if we look really at the numbers and the mass, EUR 244 million have not been used. We, I think, addressed already, over the course of the last 3 quarters, that some of that falls down a little bit in what is written in Bermuda and in other areas. So my guidance would not be that EUR 250 million was strictly added to the redundancies, but what we see is that the -- what I mentioned is that 93% combined ratio in Q4 was better than before, so you'll see something. But if you do the math, 1 percentage point combined ratio translating to over the net premiums, EUR 70 million, EUR 80 million. And I would not be surprised if, well, we come to a 3-digit's million increase in the reserve redundancies. But again, the numbers are not final, but the message I gave, it may be not the full amount, but it's a part of that.\n\n---\n\nI think it's also important to understand that a redundant loss reserve or difference to best estimate is not sitting there like an asset. It's recalculated every year. And of course, a part of the calculation, as when you calculate, use the word redundancies because it's easier for us at this point. I mean, it's not entirely correctly  because of the IFRS accounting. But I mean, you calculate the redundancies at the end of 2013, which means that you do the triangles and stuff like that, and then, of course, you have an expectation how the loss payments will evolve over the coming years. If I'm now 1 year down the line at the end of 2014, I look at the same thing. And of course, the level of redundancies is determined by the new loss reserves I put up during the year. But also, as far as the existing loss reserves, I then have to look how did the actual payment and advice losses of 2014 compare to which I presumed at the end of 2013. And then I make the new calculation, where I then have a new expected cash flow that I assume from 2014 onwards for the underwriting years, 2013 and prior, and new order for 2014, so this can change. In recent years, it always has improved because partly of the very low inflation. Clearly if, for example, inflation would suddenly increase remarkable, yes, we would have our inflation hedge, but outside that, you would see that then suddenly, also on the loss reserves, say, up until 2014, you would suddenly see higher paid losses and higher advice losses. So I mean that would then also go against the buffer. And that is also the reason why we keep that buffer. It's nice to have it, but it's not like a fixed asset, which you can take and, say, take home.\n\n---\n\nOkay. That answers your question. So the next question comes from Thomas Fossard and then we continue with Olivia.\n\n---\n\nI've got 3 questions. The first one would be, again, on the capital position. Back in October 2014, you indicated your free excess capital estimates of around EUR 1 billion. That was the last Investor Day. Could you update us on the year-end capital position adjusted for the EUR 500 million you're going to distribute in terms of cash return to shareholders? The second question would be to better understand your sensitivity to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro. Could you provide a sensitivity of your net income to 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar? And the third question would be related to your German GAAP results. Your equalization reserves are now reaching EUR 3 billion, so starting to be -- become pretty high level, could you provide a kind of -- or could you provide better understanding of where you're standing compared to a kind of ceiling when potentially the reserves -- equalization reserve addition start to be a bit smaller than they are currently?\n\n---\n\nStarting with the last question because it's the easiest. If you do nothing about it, I mean, the equalization reserves will reduce, most likely, significantly in 2017 because the World Trade Center loss drops out of the 15-year average. It reduces the volatility very, very significantly. And that then also reduces the maximum amount that can be -- or has to be put into the equalization reserve. There's, of course, options by intragroup reinsurance to deal with that issue a little bit before that. That depends how much capital management we need to do. Of course, for us, it's the best opportunity, as always, that we don't need to do any capital management because we can write such nice new profit streams that we can utilize the capital that way. But as we're not prepared to increase the volatility of our earnings with the current environment, that's not that likely. Excess capital position, we haven't calculated end of 2014 as yet, but it's probably fair to assume that there has been a further increase to soothe the, of course, retain profitability, but also the increased economic reserves, so to say, from currencies but more particular, of course, also the gains on the fixed income. And the U.S. dollar sensitivity, I would leave that to my CFO.\n\n---\n\nYes. Thank you, Uli. Well, first of all, if we look at the impact on the other expense line or income and expense line, which we have seen, this should be 0. That is a translation of the balance sheet from one balance sheet date to the other. So we have been long, as I've mentioned, in the U.S. dollar and other currencies a little bit. Theoretically, of course, that should be 0. So I don't really have a sensitivity here prepared for you, but let's do the math together. If our EBIT is around EUR 1.4 billion, but it was nearly EUR 1.5 billion, but let's take the EUR 1.4 billion, and 40% of our business and net investment income as well as net technical income comes from the U.S. dollar. So now I, of course, don't know where the next catastrophe or where the large loss will happen, but everything else equal to the 40% of the EUR 1.4 billion EBIT should be U.S. dollar-driven. And if that is, let's assume, 600 million, and then you apply your 10% on 600 million, you arrive at a number which gives you a sensitivity.\n\n---\n\nThe next question comes from Olivia and then we continue with Janet.\n\n---\n\nThe first question is going back to your capital return. So I take the point about managing the capital base and EUR 425 million being quite a nice number, but I just wanted to get your thoughts on the split between the basic dividend and the special, and especially given you've sort of guided that earnings should trend upwards in the next couple of years. So why keep the basic dividend flat? And what sort of message does that send? Could you not have made that EUR 3, EUR 3.60, EUR 3.80 and paid the balance as a special? And so just your thoughts on that, please. And then the second question on the Life & Health business, particularly given the various issues that you're  seeing in parts of the portfolio, I guess, you're more reliant than ever at the moment on Financial Solutions and delivering very good margins and very good performance. So I was just wondering if you could comment on whether you've seen any changes there in competitive pressure? And we've seen some peers stepping up their presence in that area of the business. I think 4Q profit standalone was a bit weaker than the rest of the year as well. Is there any sort of market changes that you're seeing at all? So just, maybe, some thoughts on that business would be great.\n\n---\n\nOkay on the, I mean, the split of the dividend. The main reason is that if you look at our guidance for 2015, and you take 40% of that, that is just shy of EUR 3 per share. So I mean the ordinary or the normal dividend is somewhat aligned with our guidance. I mean, even the EUR 3 would be slightly more than the 40%. That's why we left it there, so it's the first reason. And the second reason, the EUR 1.25 looks a little a bit more meaningful than if you would have only done EUR 1, so that's a split. But the first reason is the most serious one. If I look at the Financial Solutions on the Life & Health side, we were very successful in the U.S. where we have enhanced statutory balance sheet -- sheets, I mean. I guess we have a little bit of a first mover advantage there. Competition has not really increased significantly there. I mean, we have the advantage that if the clients do the deals with us, we have proven that we can do them. We have proven that the regulators would approve them. And therefore, actually the pipeline of business is actually increasing rather than decreasing. So that's a very positive part of the Life & Health business. Of course, I mean, if you look at our business at Milan and Stockholm and then Paris, for example, that is continuously showing very good profitability. So it's -- the basket on the Life & Health is a bit more mixed than I would like to see it, but it also has some very positive elements in it.\n\n---\n\nOkay, the next question comes from Janet.\n\n---\n\nI have 2 questions. Just a quick question on the dividends. I know that your GAAP earnings limits your dividend payout to some extent. Does that include the specials as well? And then further on the EV, I noticed that it was driven quite a bit by -- the increasing EV was driven by the German new business. Could you just expand a bit upon what's happening there? And also what you expect from margins going forward, because I noticed it dropped a bit? So should we expect a return to mid-teens there? Or will that be a bit lower going forward?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Yes, I mean, the entire dividend has to come from the German GAAP earnings. I mean, we call it a special dividend and ordinary dividend, of course, in the end it's one number that has to come out through German GAAP profitability. And I didn't -- I mean, EV, you mean embedded value from doing business -- a new business in Germany. I have, in fairness, a difficulty to follow that because certainly our German Life business, we see limited new business. I mean, the German Life business, at this point in time, is quite profitable, but it's largely a financing business that is in runoff. I mean, there has been -- if you look at the P&L account, on the Hannover Re SE or the E+S Re, I mean, we have changed our business relationship with E+S Re and Hannover Re, that in previous years, also, on the Life side, E+S Re ceded the German business -- part of their German business to Hannover Re, and Hannover Re ceded International business to Germany. We discontinued that. And that, of course, meant that, in the current year, the embedded value that was due to -- of course, we -- I mean, we discontinued that and paid out the embedded value of the future earnings, which was positive for E+S Re because the business that they had assumed from Hannover Re had a higher embedded value than the business that Hannover Re had assumed from E+S Re. Otherwise, on the Life & Health side, the German market is one where we put great emphasis on, but the actual new business projection in Germany is quite low.\n\n---\n\nOkay, we have another question from In-Yong.\n\n---\n\nSo we see that in the mortality and morbidity business, the EBIT margin is still below the 6% target, and you're talking about the U.S. mortality morbidity impact. Is it possible for you to quantify that? And whether without those impacts, you'd get to the 6% target for 2014?\n\n---\n\nWell, the morbidity is negative, I think, by 1.7%. And the mortality is actually quite positive, from memory, it's 7%. So the mortality is less of a problem despite the ING portfolio because, I mean, there's a lot of other mortality business in the mix that is actually a lot better, not least, I mean, the new business that we have written in the U.S. since 2009. Morbidity, I mean, it's a difficult class, but I still think that we should see an improvement due to the very high rate increases that we are getting on the Australian group business. And, of course, we have discontinued that one U.S. health scheme. And I mean, that this year will help the cash flow quite a bit because, I mean, it's a little bit of a pre-financing of rebates that our clients get from the U.S. government. And so, I mean, we had a negative cash flow last year and part of that will come back this year, unfortunately, not all of it. So I mean, that's why I think we should reach as a hurdle on the combined mortality and morbidity in the current year. And I hope I will not regret that statement.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Well, I think now we switch to questions coming from the conference call. And I see that Vikram Gandhi has a question.\n\n---\n\nI've 2 of them. One is on the P&C. It's a market, well, that you've been able to improve the attritional loss ratio in this tough environment. If you can explain how you were able to achieve that? And more importantly, how should we think about the FY '15 attritional loss ratio? And the second is, I remember you flagged during the Investor Day last year that you're close to maxing out the redundant reserves, but you seem more confident today about it. But then if that is something imminent, I wonder why you chose not to increase your FY '15 net income guidance?\n\n---\n\nOn the attritional loss ratio on P&C. I mean, in some areas, we are really benefiting from, I mean, the low -- since, really, it's a low inflation rate. And if I look, for example, on the German motor business, which is a sizable part, I mean, the frequency of losses continues to come down. We also had some areas where we had increased attritional loss ratios on some of our facultative liability business and some of our agency business. I expect that not to reoccur in 2015. So I don't think we would see an increased attritional loss ratio in 2015. It will not be improved a lot either because, I mean, the rates are clearly on average down. So I prudently expect a few less losses -- attritional losses but also less premium. And on the second question, why did we  not increase the guidance? Well, I mean, it's early days, and it's a long time for the year. We still believe that, I mean, the conservative underlying profitability of our current business fully supports our current guidance. We haven't taken into account an additional tailwind we may get -- may or may not get from the currency movement, but I mean, while one might think that the current currency movement may prevail throughout the entire year, we have no crystal ball, so we adjust for stable currencies.\n\n---\n\nAnd if may add to that. If we just look at the numbers, and we've mentioned them before, we have EUR 244 million unused budget. We had a positive impact from the currency translation. And if you just take that together, which, of course, we cannot assume for the current year, you could say that the EUR 875 million already include some improvements elsewhere if you just take the numbers as they are. Because again, we, of course, for the current year have to assume that we use the budget to the full extent.\n\n---\n\nOkay. If I can just add one more. That's on the economic solvent ratios on the 2 different basis, the 99.5% and 99.97%.  Of course, the modeling changes,  as I understand, related and down to 99.5 percentage basis. I mean, would that be a fair assumption because the one on the 99.97% doesn't seem to have moved at all? So any comments around that would be helpful.\n\n---\n\nI think the 99.97% has actually moved a little bit more even if I recall the numbers correctly. That is because of the tail value. So the individual components of the 99.7 (sic) [99.97%] have moved, however, so has the diversification, so I mean the overall number probably not so much. That's the only explanation I can give there.\n\n---\n\nOkay. The next question comes from Frank Kopfinger.\n\n---\n\nAnd I have 2 questions. My first question is on your guidance. In your guidance, on Slide 20, you said that it's going to be difficult to further increase the confidence level of the loss reserves and that this may result in a positive effect on your combined ratio. I think this is something that you already said for quite some while in the past. Nevertheless, you kept on buffering to your reserves. So when should we expect now that you stop this pattern and that you show a more clear combined ratio? And my second question is on your runoff triangle in the annual report. You show for the year 2012 and 2013, you show a combined reserve strengthening of EUR 230 million for both years, can you comment on the drivers behind it, please?\n\n---\n\nYes, on the later one, of course, on the newer years' as we reserve on an underwriting year basis, there's, of course, I mean, the loss ratio picks on 2013, in particular, that comes through. I mean, on the buffer, I mean, as I said, I mean, it's a new calculation every year. This year, we were still in a rather comfortable situation because, I mean, if you look at the underlying reported profitability, we were in a rather comfortable situation and, therefore, we remained cautious on the combined ratios. Because we expect that the market will continue to softening as long as we're not seeing any major volatility or deteriorating underwriting results in the reinsurance market. And therefore, of course, I mean, we're more comfortable if we have conservative reserves than having less conservative reserves, so we will keep them conservative as long as we can. However, I suspect that, that will not last for much longer.\n\n---\n\n[Operator Instructions] In the meantime, we have 2 more questions, one from Peter Casanova and the next one from Thomas Fossard.\n\n---\n\nThis was just a -- Peter Casanova, Kepler Cheuvreux group. This was just a follow-up on the math and the guidance from Roland. You told us that you had currency headwind last year. We know that we had lower budget cat expense. Now we've heard that there were some reserve additions. So what I would like to understand, do you believe that the underlying business is growing this year? Or are we going for a decline, which the pure numbers would imply? Very simple question.\n\n---\n\nWhat I mean is the top line will, I think, grow slightly. And I mean, of course, last year we had currency tailwind, not headwind. So I mean, we, of course, in the guidance, are not expecting any currency gains in the current year because, I mean, we just assume that we are currency-matched and, therefore, we expect the currency result to be entirely neutral.\n\n---\n\nThat is the basis for, also, our guidance with a flat and slightly increased turnover. That is the assumption that the currency exchange rates will keep flat. If you compare as to when we put up that estimation, which was early February, what happened since then. You could argue it's already to be adjusted upwards. But again, it doesn't make sense to do that on a daily basis. The assumption overall is that we are matched and that the currency exchange rates stay where they are all over the year. And then we would update these numbers over the course of the years. So as soon as we have the first quarter results in, then 3 quarters of the year will be calculated on the basis of matched and flat currency exchange rates. And we would then already include the experience of the first quarter and so on and so on.\n\n---\n\nI would also say that this is not meant to be a point guidance. We should say it should be in the region of EUR 875 million and, of course, that leaves room both sides. I mean, it's not that we say it's exactly EUR 875 million.\n\n---\n\nHow we would like us to understand -- how you would like us to understand is that you make an underlying improvement 2014 to 2015, if there are not big swings outside of what you can influence. Is this how we should understand the guidance?\n\n---\n\nWell, the guidance is basically on a like-for-like basis. I mean we just look to -- because the guidance was really -- I mean, we did set in -- at the -- in the first quarter and at the end of third quarter last year. We do that vis-a-vis our planning. So I mean the basis for the guidance is a bottom-up planning of our business groups. And of course, if they plan the results for the coming year, then we have a plausibility check and that is then the basis for the guidance. Then at -- after 1/1, we do the first expectation. And this is, of course, again then bottom up to see if there are major changes and what our underwriters believed, say, prior to the beginning of the year. And I mean, other than currency, which we take neutral, I mean, such changes were really not that dramatic that we would change the guidance up or down.\n\n---\n\nOkay, the next question comes from Thomas Fossard.\n\n---\n\nOne question on the underwriting environment. If you could comment a bit more what you're expecting for Q1 and July 1 because looking at Slide #6 of your pack, it seems to be that more and more insurers are posting double-digit return on equity. So it seems to me that the industry is far from showing any pain from the current environment though I know that the claims environment has been pretty low in the past years, but still, I mean, how would you expect the system to have some impact on the underwriting environment?\n\n---\n\nWell, I would assume that we will see pretty much more of the same than we saw at 1/1, being an overall soft market with the individual market players trying to show discipline, partly successful, I would say. I don't think that, that would change a great deal. I mean, I would say from the opportunities to write business, for us, that should continue to be quite favorable as we currently see. [indiscernible]adjust the price because, I mean, we cannot unfortunately isolate ourselves from the market and charge a lot more than our competition and still get the business. So we have to be careful and have to be, I mean, selective in what we do. The good thing is that we can be selective because the business that we get offered is significantly more than what we write. So I mean there is this -- we are in a position to have that ability of selectivity. What do I feel, I mean, it will probably be a diverse market again because if you go outside the cat space, I mean, the market has not been entirely loss-free. So if you go to some of the casualty lines, some of the property per-risk business, I mean, you also have just loss-driven price increases. So you have to put that in the overall mix. But I mean there's no question the market will continue to be difficult.\n\n---\n\nAnd Thomas, maybe, if I could add. I was intending to mention that during my presentation but tried to kept it short. I think your observation is right. There are more competitors in the double-digit ROE space than in the year before. I think this is, of course, also driven by low large losses, especially if you look at some. But these are usually listed companies, and they have achieved attractive or more attractive ROEs. They do narrower. So as soon as there will be the large losses again and the burden or the various budgets will no longer be so loss-free as they had been before, there will immediately be pressure on those ROEs, which also keeps us a bit comfortable that these positive developments here are to be defended and will create a floor. This is not to say that there will be no competition and everything is going to be great. But I think these more positive developments ROE-wise do also have a little bit of healthy development for the industry.\n\n---\n\nOkay. We have another question coming from the conference call, which is coming from Michael Haid.\n\n---\n\nMichael Haid, MainFirst Bank. Just one question. In the current low-interest trade environment, many fixed-income securities trade at a negative yield. And, obviously, it makes sense to sell them immediately rather than holding them to mature. My question, how much fraction of your fixed-income portfolio currently drives[ph] at a negative yield? And more importantly, how much unrealized capital evident gains would you have on them, just roughly?\n\n---\n\nMichael, this is -- I don't think that there -- you indicated there that there should be a lot of them trading at a negative yield. I'm not exactly sure why that is true, but to be frank, I don't have that number with me. We can follow up on that, but I don't have that perspective available in front of me.\n\n---\n\nSorry.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I do not have any further questions from the conference call. If we do not have any other questions coming from this room, then we'd like to thank you for your attendance and we'd like to conclude this call. And you now might disconnect it. For all those others here in the room, we would like to cordially invite you, on behalf of Hannover Re, for a snack and a refreshment outside of this room. And thank you for attending. Thank you for coming.\n\n---\n\nThank you very much.",
      "transcript_text4": "【回答: Karl Steinle (Executives)】\nWell, thank you much. We will now begin with our question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] We will proceed to take the questions from the participants here in the room first, and then switch to the questions coming from the conference call. I already see some hands up. And we start with the right-hand side with Ben.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Ben Cohen (Analysts)】\nBen Cohen at Canaccord Genuity. Two questions, please. Firstly, in terms of the special dividend that you're paying, could you just say a bit more as to how you arrived at the size that special? It seems to me that you actually could've done more to help support the ROE if you still have that 13% target into 2015. My second question, your share price is up, I think, 50% since we last saw you here in October, or whenever it was. In terms of that re-rating, is there anything strategically that you think that gives you more firepower to do? Would you feel that, that could be some benefit to use that multiple, maybe in terms of M&A or anything else strategically? That'll be helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Wallin (Executives)】\nYes. Thank you very much, Ben, for those questions. I should press the button here, Okay, but I find mic's on anyhow. If not so much of the problem. I mean, on the dividend, the EUR 4.25 was really driven by our German GAAP earnings, which we, of course, steer towards that level. We felt that this is, I mean, a good dividend. It's about, I mean, 50%, a little bit more than 50% of our IFRS earnings. And we felt that, that would reflect the underlying strengthening of the capital relatively well. Could we have done more? Sure, you always can do more. However, we felt that it was a good level. Of course, I mean, that would still make it rather challenging to keep the ROE at the level you mentioned for 2015, but we have to see what else we can do there. On the share price using it for M&A, well, I mean, it's of course quite tempting, I would say, because the value was pretty good. It's a bit difficult to do that with our anchor shareholder tailings [ph] was 50.2% on the basis that we -- as we strategically want to keep the majority in Hannover Re.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Karl Steinle (Executives)】\nOkay. We continue with Kamran and switch then to Roger [ph].\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kamran Hossain (Analysts)】\nIt's Kamran Hossain from RBC. Two questions. The first one is just -- I guess, just coming back to M&A. So we've seen a recently announced merger in Bermuda, where we're going to get the fifth or -- fourth, fifth or sixth largest reinsurance player in the market being created, depending on whose numbers you use. Do you expect to see any disruption from this merger? I mean, I guess given their distribution using both is pretty heavily versus your distribution. And the second question is just on your comments about the improved retrocession program. So you've improved the program year-on-year, should we expect the catastrophe loss ratio as a proportion of your net earned premium to actually come down in the future as a result of this?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Wallin (Executives)】\nThe loss -- for which loss ratio?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kamran Hossain (Analysts)】\nThe catastrophe.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Wallin (Executives)】\nOh, yes. Okay. Okay, if I first come to the question on M&A, that we have seen in Bermuda I mean, to the extent that, that is reinsurance driven, we see that marginally positive for us because it means that there is one competitor less. And I mean, on the latest one, both are very respectable reinsurance players. I mean, you just have a growing [ph] panel there, there's just one left, which is marginally not -- I mean, it's not overly positive, but it's marginally positive. We do normally appreciate mergers of reinsurers. Of course, there's another aspect to it. I mean, all these merged companies, they also have a primary insurance activities where we are normally the reinsurer of. And then, of course, there is an expectation that they would, I mean, increase their retentions for reassuring their primary business. That of course means that in order to keep our volume there, we would have to increase our lines to the extent that's possible. So as you can see, it has some positive and some negative aspects. In general, I would say, we prefer reinsurers to merge than primary insurers to merge. And the question on the catastrophe loss ratio, no, that would probably stay reasonably unchanged because -- I mean, we did not change in absolute terms our risk appetite for cat. And if you buy a little bit more retro, that means that you write a little bit more growth business, because -- I mean, our risk appetite that we give us for ourselves still limits our cat writing significantly below what we would have been able to write if we would stipulate a higher risk appetite. I mean, we see that very clearly, currently, for example, in the Japanese renewals.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Karl Steinle (Executives)】\nOkay. The next question comes from Roger Franz [ph].\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nYes, a couple of questions about your economic solvency ratio. That was down quite considerably from 330% to 286%, and I understand that the decline was almost entirely due to model changes. Can you please elaborate a little bit on the what kind of model changes these were? And also what the key drivers for the decline was? And whether you expect further model changes and what impact it could have until you get the approval. And finally, once the models improved, can we expect very explicit target or target range for the economic solvency?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Wallin (Executives)】\nYes, that's very correct. We did do some model changes. That was of course after discussions with our regulator where we have -- will actually hand in our application for the SAP group model for Hannover Re at the beginning of April and happen to have the meeting with BaFin tomorrow. These model changes were largely on the market risk, basically on the spread and credit risk where, up until now, the model had quite a lot of diversification between the credits and issues. And since the -- in a dialogue with the BaFin, it was felt that we share the group certain business segment closer together, which then reduces the diversification and that increased the capital requirements on that business. That really was a major change that we had. We believe that with the changes that we have done now, that would lead us through the application process for the SAP group model of Hannover Re. Of course, there will be future model changes because, I mean, you have to really look at the model on a constant basis and see if the parameters that you have put in are still, I mean, plausible and relevant, and there is, of course, the model change policies that we have. I mean, I would not expect that they will be similarly drastic. At the same time, of course, we will be looking for target solvency once the model has been approved. That is the answer to that question, really.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Karl Steinle (Executives)】\nOkay. We continue with Andrew.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nThree quick questions. One, just a follow-up on your last answer. I don't understand then why the diversification benefit on Page 84 has gone up 51%. If you've reduced the diversification, so how come the overall -- as the proportion of the gross capital requirements gone up, I think, from 32% to 36%?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Wallin (Executives)】\nYes. I mean, that diversification was within the credit and spread risk was reduced. Therefore, the number -- the cat requirement for the credit and spread risk and market risk widened. But that of course meant that if you then look at the diversification with the underwriting risk, life and non-life, and the interest rate risk, then the overall risk have increased, the diversification has increased as well. That is the diversification on the entire bottom line capital requirement.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nAnd the growth -- the significant growth in life and health underwriting department, is that purely volume of business driving that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Wallin (Executives)】\nIt's -- yes, that's mostly volume actually.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nOkay. And the 2 other quick questions. If I look at your life reinsurance business and your MCEV disclosure, over the last 5 years, it's been just short of EUR 800 million of negative operating variances or assumption changes related to U.S., U.K., longevity, Australian DII. You continue to express a lot of confidence in the life result improving and also in your EV translating into IFRS profit. It's a bit hard for us to kind of see that, given the amount of assumption changes and variances that have been going through. So maybe -- do you think that you need to do it in a more thorough kind of ground-up review again of assumptions? Or are we really past the worst on, particularly in the U.S.? I still find it hard to get comfortable with the outlook there. The only other question I had, I think the implication is that you've booked the unused budget on large losses. Is that how you want us to think about it, rather, as in the EUR 200-roughly million of unused. Hence, that's what's driving the sort of slight increase in reserve buffer, again?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Wallin (Executives)】\nWell, I'll leave the budget to Roland, and we'll try to give you an answer on the Life & Health side. I mean, clearly, there were negative developments on the DII, the group business and the U.S. mortality business. I mean, we feel that we take these model changes early on to be on the conservative side there. I mean, of course, in the -- sooner rather than later, we should come to a situation where the actual to expected and model changes are closer to the 0 line rather than being negative. I would expect that, for the Australian business and the Longevity business, we would not see major changes here. On the U.S. mortality business, I haven't got the same confidence as yet. So I mean, we will have to observe that. But as far as the value of new business is concerned, I mean, that has not been the -- at least the value of new business that we have created in recent years has not been the source of negative variances or negative model changes. This has been more business that has been written quite a long time ago or has been acquired with the ING transaction. So I would say, with the underwriting changes that we made in 2009, at least we haven't dug us new holes, let's put it that way.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roland Vogel (Executives)】\nAnd, maybe, perhaps, a short comment on the MCEV. We, I think, for a few years already, mentioned that very openly that we really follow the guidance of the CFO forum, which I'm a member of, very, very strictly. So also, when other  company may be adjusted their way of calculating financial options and guarantees or whatsoever, we really stuck to the methodology, so there is no smoothing, no addressing. So we follow these things. And as the overall numbers are really positive, we look also, I would say, conservatively or very strictly on the guidance, which led to what you felt is, in cumulative terms, an amount of adjustment, which affects credibility a little bit, I think, but it is also a reflection of us really following the rules very strictly. Coming back on the unused budgets, if we look really at the numbers and the mass, EUR 244 million have not been used. We, I think, addressed already, over the course of the last 3 quarters, that some of that falls down a little bit in what is written in Bermuda and in other areas. So my guidance would not be that EUR 250 million was strictly added to the redundancies, but what we see is that the -- what I mentioned is that 93% combined ratio in Q4 was better than before, so you'll see something. But if you do the math, 1 percentage point combined ratio translating to over the net premiums, EUR 70 million, EUR 80 million. And I would not be surprised if, well, we come to a 3-digit's million increase in the reserve redundancies. But again, the numbers are not final, but the message I gave, it may be not the full amount, but it's a part of that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Wallin (Executives)】\nI think it's also important to understand that a redundant loss reserve or difference to best estimate is not sitting there like an asset. It's recalculated every year. And of course, a part of the calculation, as when you calculate, use the word redundancies because it's easier for us at this point. I mean, it's not entirely correctly  because of the IFRS accounting. But I mean, you calculate the redundancies at the end of 2013, which means that you do the triangles and stuff like that, and then, of course, you have an expectation how the loss payments will evolve over the coming years. If I'm now 1 year down the line at the end of 2014, I look at the same thing. And of course, the level of redundancies is determined by the new loss reserves I put up during the year. But also, as far as the existing loss reserves, I then have to look how did the actual payment and advice losses of 2014 compare to which I presumed at the end of 2013. And then I make the new calculation, where I then have a new expected cash flow that I assume from 2014 onwards for the underwriting years, 2013 and prior, and new order for 2014, so this can change. In recent years, it always has improved because partly of the very low inflation. Clearly if, for example, inflation would suddenly increase remarkable, yes, we would have our inflation hedge, but outside that, you would see that then suddenly, also on the loss reserves, say, up until 2014, you would suddenly see higher paid losses and higher advice losses. So I mean that would then also go against the buffer. And that is also the reason why we keep that buffer. It's nice to have it, but it's not like a fixed asset, which you can take and, say, take home.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Klaus Miller (Executives)】\nOkay. That answers your question. So the next question comes from Thomas Fossard and then we continue with Olivia.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Fossard (Analysts)】\nI've got 3 questions. The first one would be, again, on the capital position. Back in October 2014, you indicated your free excess capital estimates of around EUR 1 billion. That was the last Investor Day. Could you update us on the year-end capital position adjusted for the EUR 500 million you're going to distribute in terms of cash return to shareholders? The second question would be to better understand your sensitivity to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro. Could you provide a sensitivity of your net income to 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar? And the third question would be related to your German GAAP results. Your equalization reserves are now reaching EUR 3 billion, so starting to be -- become pretty high level, could you provide a kind of -- or could you provide better understanding of where you're standing compared to a kind of ceiling when potentially the reserves -- equalization reserve addition start to be a bit smaller than they are currently?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Wallin (Executives)】\nStarting with the last question because it's the easiest. If you do nothing about it, I mean, the equalization reserves will reduce, most likely, significantly in 2017 because the World Trade Center loss drops out of the 15-year average. It reduces the volatility very, very significantly. And that then also reduces the maximum amount that can be -- or has to be put into the equalization reserve. There's, of course, options by intragroup reinsurance to deal with that issue a little bit before that. That depends how much capital management we need to do. Of course, for us, it's the best opportunity, as always, that we don't need to do any capital management because we can write such nice new profit streams that we can utilize the capital that way. But as we're not prepared to increase the volatility of our earnings with the current environment, that's not that likely. Excess capital position, we haven't calculated end of 2014 as yet, but it's probably fair to assume that there has been a further increase to soothe the, of course, retain profitability, but also the increased economic reserves, so to say, from currencies but more particular, of course, also the gains on the fixed income. And the U.S. dollar sensitivity, I would leave that to my CFO.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roland Vogel (Executives)】\nYes. Thank you, Uli. Well, first of all, if we look at the impact on the other expense line or income and expense line, which we have seen, this should be 0. That is a translation of the balance sheet from one balance sheet date to the other. So we have been long, as I've mentioned, in the U.S. dollar and other currencies a little bit. Theoretically, of course, that should be 0. So I don't really have a sensitivity here prepared for you, but let's do the math together. If our EBIT is around EUR 1.4 billion, but it was nearly EUR 1.5 billion, but let's take the EUR 1.4 billion, and 40% of our business and net investment income as well as net technical income comes from the U.S. dollar. So now I, of course, don't know where the next catastrophe or where the large loss will happen, but everything else equal to the 40% of the EUR 1.4 billion EBIT should be U.S. dollar-driven. And if that is, let's assume, 600 million, and then you apply your 10% on 600 million, you arrive at a number which gives you a sensitivity.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Klaus Miller (Executives)】\nThe next question comes from Olivia and then we continue with Janet.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Olivia Brindle (Analysts)】\nThe first question is going back to your capital return. So I take the point about managing the capital base and EUR 425 million being quite a nice number, but I just wanted to get your thoughts on the split between the basic dividend and the special, and especially given you've sort of guided that earnings should trend upwards in the next couple of years. So why keep the basic dividend flat? And what sort of message does that send? Could you not have made that EUR 3, EUR 3.60, EUR 3.80 and paid the balance as a special? And so just your thoughts on that, please. And then the second question on the Life & Health business, particularly given the various issues that you're  seeing in parts of the portfolio, I guess, you're more reliant than ever at the moment on Financial Solutions and delivering very good margins and very good performance. So I was just wondering if you could comment on whether you've seen any changes there in competitive pressure? And we've seen some peers stepping up their presence in that area of the business. I think 4Q profit standalone was a bit weaker than the rest of the year as well. Is there any sort of market changes that you're seeing at all? So just, maybe, some thoughts on that business would be great.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Wallin (Executives)】\nOkay on the, I mean, the split of the dividend. The main reason is that if you look at our guidance for 2015, and you take 40% of that, that is just shy of EUR 3 per share. So I mean the ordinary or the normal dividend is somewhat aligned with our guidance. I mean, even the EUR 3 would be slightly more than the 40%. That's why we left it there, so it's the first reason. And the second reason, the EUR 1.25 looks a little a bit more meaningful than if you would have only done EUR 1, so that's a split. But the first reason is the most serious one. If I look at the Financial Solutions on the Life & Health side, we were very successful in the U.S. where we have enhanced statutory balance sheet -- sheets, I mean. I guess we have a little bit of a first mover advantage there. Competition has not really increased significantly there. I mean, we have the advantage that if the clients do the deals with us, we have proven that we can do them. We have proven that the regulators would approve them. And therefore, actually the pipeline of business is actually increasing rather than decreasing. So that's a very positive part of the Life & Health business. Of course, I mean, if you look at our business at Milan and Stockholm and then Paris, for example, that is continuously showing very good profitability. So it's -- the basket on the Life & Health is a bit more mixed than I would like to see it, but it also has some very positive elements in it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Klaus Miller (Executives)】\nOkay, the next question comes from Janet.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Janet Van Den Berg (Analysts)】\nI have 2 questions. Just a quick question on the dividends. I know that your GAAP earnings limits your dividend payout to some extent. Does that include the specials as well? And then further on the EV, I noticed that it was driven quite a bit by -- the increasing EV was driven by the German new business. Could you just expand a bit upon what's happening there? And also what you expect from margins going forward, because I noticed it dropped a bit? So should we expect a return to mid-teens there? Or will that be a bit lower going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Wallin (Executives)】\nOkay. Yes, I mean, the entire dividend has to come from the German GAAP earnings. I mean, we call it a special dividend and ordinary dividend, of course, in the end it's one number that has to come out through German GAAP profitability. And I didn't -- I mean, EV, you mean embedded value from doing business -- a new business in Germany. I have, in fairness, a difficulty to follow that because certainly our German Life business, we see limited new business. I mean, the German Life business, at this point in time, is quite profitable, but it's largely a financing business that is in runoff. I mean, there has been -- if you look at the P&L account, on the Hannover Re SE or the E+S Re, I mean, we have changed our business relationship with E+S Re and Hannover Re, that in previous years, also, on the Life side, E+S Re ceded the German business -- part of their German business to Hannover Re, and Hannover Re ceded International business to Germany. We discontinued that. And that, of course, meant that, in the current year, the embedded value that was due to -- of course, we -- I mean, we discontinued that and paid out the embedded value of the future earnings, which was positive for E+S Re because the business that they had assumed from Hannover Re had a higher embedded value than the business that Hannover Re had assumed from E+S Re. Otherwise, on the Life & Health side, the German market is one where we put great emphasis on, but the actual new business projection in Germany is quite low.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Klaus Miller (Executives)】\nOkay, we have another question from In-Yong.\n\n---\n\n【質問: In-Yong Hwang (Analysts)】\nSo we see that in the mortality and morbidity business, the EBIT margin is still below the 6% target, and you're talking about the U.S. mortality morbidity impact. Is it possible for you to quantify that? And whether without those impacts, you'd get to the 6% target for 2014?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Wallin (Executives)】\nWell, the morbidity is negative, I think, by 1.7%. And the mortality is actually quite positive, from memory, it's 7%. So the mortality is less of a problem despite the ING portfolio because, I mean, there's a lot of other mortality business in the mix that is actually a lot better, not least, I mean, the new business that we have written in the U.S. since 2009. Morbidity, I mean, it's a difficult class, but I still think that we should see an improvement due to the very high rate increases that we are getting on the Australian group business. And, of course, we have discontinued that one U.S. health scheme. And I mean, that this year will help the cash flow quite a bit because, I mean, it's a little bit of a pre-financing of rebates that our clients get from the U.S. government. And so, I mean, we had a negative cash flow last year and part of that will come back this year, unfortunately, not all of it. So I mean, that's why I think we should reach as a hurdle on the combined mortality and morbidity in the current year. And I hope I will not regret that statement.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Klaus Miller (Executives)】\nOkay. Well, I think now we switch to questions coming from the conference call. And I see that Vikram Gandhi has a question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vikram Gandhi (Analysts)】\nI've 2 of them. One is on the P&C. It's a market, well, that you've been able to improve the attritional loss ratio in this tough environment. If you can explain how you were able to achieve that? And more importantly, how should we think about the FY '15 attritional loss ratio? And the second is, I remember you flagged during the Investor Day last year that you're close to maxing out the redundant reserves, but you seem more confident today about it. But then if that is something imminent, I wonder why you chose not to increase your FY '15 net income guidance?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Wallin (Executives)】\nOn the attritional loss ratio on P&C. I mean, in some areas, we are really benefiting from, I mean, the low -- since, really, it's a low inflation rate. And if I look, for example, on the German motor business, which is a sizable part, I mean, the frequency of losses continues to come down. We also had some areas where we had increased attritional loss ratios on some of our facultative liability business and some of our agency business. I expect that not to reoccur in 2015. So I don't think we would see an increased attritional loss ratio in 2015. It will not be improved a lot either because, I mean, the rates are clearly on average down. So I prudently expect a few less losses -- attritional losses but also less premium. And on the second question, why did we  not increase the guidance? Well, I mean, it's early days, and it's a long time for the year. We still believe that, I mean, the conservative underlying profitability of our current business fully supports our current guidance. We haven't taken into account an additional tailwind we may get -- may or may not get from the currency movement, but I mean, while one might think that the current currency movement may prevail throughout the entire year, we have no crystal ball, so we adjust for stable currencies.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roland Vogel (Executives)】\nAnd if may add to that. If we just look at the numbers, and we've mentioned them before, we have EUR 244 million unused budget. We had a positive impact from the currency translation. And if you just take that together, which, of course, we cannot assume for the current year, you could say that the EUR 875 million already include some improvements elsewhere if you just take the numbers as they are. Because again, we, of course, for the current year have to assume that we use the budget to the full extent.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vikram Gandhi (Analysts)】\nOkay. If I can just add one more. That's on the economic solvent ratios on the 2 different basis, the 99.5% and 99.97%.  Of course, the modeling changes,  as I understand, related and down to 99.5 percentage basis. I mean, would that be a fair assumption because the one on the 99.97% doesn't seem to have moved at all? So any comments around that would be helpful.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Wallin (Executives)】\nI think the 99.97% has actually moved a little bit more even if I recall the numbers correctly. That is because of the tail value. So the individual components of the 99.7 (sic) [99.97%] have moved, however, so has the diversification, so I mean the overall number probably not so much. That's the only explanation I can give there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Klaus Miller (Executives)】\nOkay. The next question comes from Frank Kopfinger.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Frank Kopfinger (Analysts)】\nAnd I have 2 questions. My first question is on your guidance. In your guidance, on Slide 20, you said that it's going to be difficult to further increase the confidence level of the loss reserves and that this may result in a positive effect on your combined ratio. I think this is something that you already said for quite some while in the past. Nevertheless, you kept on buffering to your reserves. So when should we expect now that you stop this pattern and that you show a more clear combined ratio? And my second question is on your runoff triangle in the annual report. You show for the year 2012 and 2013, you show a combined reserve strengthening of EUR 230 million for both years, can you comment on the drivers behind it, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Wallin (Executives)】\nYes, on the later one, of course, on the newer years' as we reserve on an underwriting year basis, there's, of course, I mean, the loss ratio picks on 2013, in particular, that comes through. I mean, on the buffer, I mean, as I said, I mean, it's a new calculation every year. This year, we were still in a rather comfortable situation because, I mean, if you look at the underlying reported profitability, we were in a rather comfortable situation and, therefore, we remained cautious on the combined ratios. Because we expect that the market will continue to softening as long as we're not seeing any major volatility or deteriorating underwriting results in the reinsurance market. And therefore, of course, I mean, we're more comfortable if we have conservative reserves than having less conservative reserves, so we will keep them conservative as long as we can. However, I suspect that, that will not last for much longer.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Klaus Miller (Executives)】\n[Operator Instructions] In the meantime, we have 2 more questions, one from Peter Casanova and the next one from Thomas Fossard.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Casanova (Analysts)】\nThis was just a -- Peter Casanova, Kepler Cheuvreux group. This was just a follow-up on the math and the guidance from Roland. You told us that you had currency headwind last year. We know that we had lower budget cat expense. Now we've heard that there were some reserve additions. So what I would like to understand, do you believe that the underlying business is growing this year? Or are we going for a decline, which the pure numbers would imply? Very simple question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Wallin (Executives)】\nWhat I mean is the top line will, I think, grow slightly. And I mean, of course, last year we had currency tailwind, not headwind. So I mean, we, of course, in the guidance, are not expecting any currency gains in the current year because, I mean, we just assume that we are currency-matched and, therefore, we expect the currency result to be entirely neutral.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roland Vogel (Executives)】\nThat is the basis for, also, our guidance with a flat and slightly increased turnover. That is the assumption that the currency exchange rates will keep flat. If you compare as to when we put up that estimation, which was early February, what happened since then. You could argue it's already to be adjusted upwards. But again, it doesn't make sense to do that on a daily basis. The assumption overall is that we are matched and that the currency exchange rates stay where they are all over the year. And then we would update these numbers over the course of the years. So as soon as we have the first quarter results in, then 3 quarters of the year will be calculated on the basis of matched and flat currency exchange rates. And we would then already include the experience of the first quarter and so on and so on.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Wallin (Executives)】\nI would also say that this is not meant to be a point guidance. We should say it should be in the region of EUR 875 million and, of course, that leaves room both sides. I mean, it's not that we say it's exactly EUR 875 million.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Peter Casanova (Analysts)】\nHow we would like us to understand -- how you would like us to understand is that you make an underlying improvement 2014 to 2015, if there are not big swings outside of what you can influence. Is this how we should understand the guidance?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roland Vogel (Executives)】\nWell, the guidance is basically on a like-for-like basis. I mean we just look to -- because the guidance was really -- I mean, we did set in -- at the -- in the first quarter and at the end of third quarter last year. We do that vis-a-vis our planning. So I mean the basis for the guidance is a bottom-up planning of our business groups. And of course, if they plan the results for the coming year, then we have a plausibility check and that is then the basis for the guidance. Then at -- after 1/1, we do the first expectation. And this is, of course, again then bottom up to see if there are major changes and what our underwriters believed, say, prior to the beginning of the year. And I mean, other than currency, which we take neutral, I mean, such changes were really not that dramatic that we would change the guidance up or down.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Klaus Miller (Executives)】\nOkay, the next question comes from Thomas Fossard.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Fossard (Analysts)】\nOne question on the underwriting environment. If you could comment a bit more what you're expecting for Q1 and July 1 because looking at Slide #6 of your pack, it seems to be that more and more insurers are posting double-digit return on equity. So it seems to me that the industry is far from showing any pain from the current environment though I know that the claims environment has been pretty low in the past years, but still, I mean, how would you expect the system to have some impact on the underwriting environment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Wallin (Executives)】\nWell, I would assume that we will see pretty much more of the same than we saw at 1/1, being an overall soft market with the individual market players trying to show discipline, partly successful, I would say. I don't think that, that would change a great deal. I mean, I would say from the opportunities to write business, for us, that should continue to be quite favorable as we currently see. [indiscernible]adjust the price because, I mean, we cannot unfortunately isolate ourselves from the market and charge a lot more than our competition and still get the business. So we have to be careful and have to be, I mean, selective in what we do. The good thing is that we can be selective because the business that we get offered is significantly more than what we write. So I mean there is this -- we are in a position to have that ability of selectivity. What do I feel, I mean, it will probably be a diverse market again because if you go outside the cat space, I mean, the market has not been entirely loss-free. So if you go to some of the casualty lines, some of the property per-risk business, I mean, you also have just loss-driven price increases. So you have to put that in the overall mix. But I mean there's no question the market will continue to be difficult.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roland Vogel (Executives)】\nAnd Thomas, maybe, if I could add. I was intending to mention that during my presentation but tried to kept it short. I think your observation is right. There are more competitors in the double-digit ROE space than in the year before. I think this is, of course, also driven by low large losses, especially if you look at some. But these are usually listed companies, and they have achieved attractive or more attractive ROEs. They do narrower. So as soon as there will be the large losses again and the burden or the various budgets will no longer be so loss-free as they had been before, there will immediately be pressure on those ROEs, which also keeps us a bit comfortable that these positive developments here are to be defended and will create a floor. This is not to say that there will be no competition and everything is going to be great. But I think these more positive developments ROE-wise do also have a little bit of healthy development for the industry.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Klaus Miller (Executives)】\nOkay. We have another question coming from the conference call, which is coming from Michael Haid.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Michael Haid (Analysts)】\nMichael Haid, MainFirst Bank. Just one question. In the current low-interest trade environment, many fixed-income securities trade at a negative yield. And, obviously, it makes sense to sell them immediately rather than holding them to mature. My question, how much fraction of your fixed-income portfolio currently drives[ph] at a negative yield? And more importantly, how much unrealized capital evident gains would you have on them, just roughly?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Wallin (Executives)】\nMichael, this is -- I don't think that there -- you indicated there that there should be a lot of them trading at a negative yield. I'm not exactly sure why that is true, but to be frank, I don't have that number with me. We can follow up on that, but I don't have that perspective available in front of me.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roland Vogel (Executives)】\nSorry.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Klaus Miller (Executives)】\nOkay. I do not have any further questions from the conference call. If we do not have any other questions coming from this room, then we'd like to thank you for your attendance and we'd like to conclude this call. And you now might disconnect it. For all those others here in the room, we would like to cordially invite you, on behalf of Hannover Re, for a snack and a refreshment outside of this room. And thank you for attending. Thank you for coming.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ulrich Wallin (Executives)】\nThank you very much.",

We hope all of you have somehow digested the massive news flow on the sector over the last couple of weeks.\r\nAs always, before we start I have to mention first that you should have received by mail the link to our press release, to our preliminary consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2014, as well as the analyst and investor presentation. If you did not receive any of the aforementioned, please visit our IR website.\r\nIf you're already using a tablet-only, you can have a look at the Conti IR and you will find all the material available already there.\r\nIn the course of this afternoon, the tale of 2014 will also be available on our website for download.\r\nI should also make you aware of Page 34 in the presentation, which contains our disclaimer. And last but not least, you can also follow this conference call via webcast.\r\nAs in the last 5 years, we start with the presentation, which is given by our CFO, Wolfgang Schafer, who is next to me sitting here in the room in Hanover together with my colleagues from Media Relations and from Treasury and Finance. We will host a Q&A after the presentation. And after the call, the IR team will be available and ready to clarify any open questions you might have.\r\nSo my name is Rolf Woller, and I hand over to Wolfgang that he can start with the interesting part of this call. Wolfgang, please go ahead.\n\n---\n\nWelcome to all of you. And before I guide you through the presentation, let me remind you of the Q4 market environment last year. Global car production was flat in the last quarter of 2014. Europe was down 2%. This includes Russia with minus 32% in the fourth quarter and France was minus 5%. And this was compensated outside of Europe with China and the U.S. market, which were each growing by 5%. Replacement tire markets were even weaker. Mild winter in Europe made the market plunged to minus 8% and the stronger North American market could go only partly compensate that.\r\nNow how does this continue into 2015? We see the production in Q1 slightly up from the fourth quarter levels in Europe, but not as strong as hoped. New car sales trend in Europe, though, is making us confident that this should change in the next coming weeks or months and have a positive impact then on the production.\r\nThe tire markets in Europe remained weak at the start of 2015. Nevertheless, we can say that against this backdrop, we had a favorable start into the year confirming our close to double-digits sales growth expectation for the full year of 2015.\r\nFor other corporation highlights, I'm moving to Page 3 of the presentation. Our sales were up by 4% to EUR 34.5 billion, including a negative FX impact of EUR 470 million. The adjusted EBIT was up by 4% to EUR 3.9 billion with a margin at 11.3% compared to the 11.2% of 2013. The net income was up by 24% to EUR 2.4 billion, mainly due to massive reduction of our interest of more than EUR 500 million to minus EUR 265 million. Main reason for this is the early redemption and the partly replacements of our bonds in 2013, which positively influenced 2014, and which will have a lasting effect in 2015 following.\r\nFree cash flow amounted to EUR 2 billion, up 11%, all-time record for Continental. And the net indebtedness, consequently, goes down to EUR 2.8 billion, achieving a gearing ratio of 26%, equity ratio at the company at around 37%.\r\nWe managed to create sustainably value and the trailing ROCE was up by another 60 basis points to now our target rate of 20%.\r\nAnd 3 other topics I would like to mention under the most important KPIs of the full year. The acquisition volume in our Automotive Group achieved a new record with EUR 30 billion lifetime sales, which we managed to acquire last year. We finally closed the Veyance acquisition on January 30, 2015. And the third point to mention, our boards will recommend to the annual shareholder meeting to pay a dividend of EUR 3.25, an increase of 30% from last year.\r\nA closer look on the sales and the adjusted EBIT of the group is presented on Page 5. First, you -- if you have a look at the last 4 columns of the slide, you can see the nice increase quarter-over-quarter, which we have shown in our sales development. The fourth quarter was EUR 8.9 billion, EUR 500 million up to the previous year, organically flat 3%, and the adjusted EBIT margin in the last quarter at 10.8%.\r\nThe development of the Auto and the Rubber Group in the fourth quarter was quite different though. And to get more view on that, I move to Page 6. And the left graph is showing the development of the Automotive Group. There, the organic growth was 5% or EUR 5.4 billion, which is a nominal increase of 9%, and the adjusted EBIT was up to EUR 455 million, plus 11%, increasing the margin, again compared to the quarter of the previous year, from 8.2% to 8.4%.\r\nAnd different to Automotive, the Rubber Group growth was quite modest, only plus 2%, mainly 2 reasons for that. Weak replacement tire markets, Europe -- European replacement tire markets, minus 8% in the fourth quarter. I've mentioned this already, and on the quantity side, still, it's a weak mining business, which is affecting the sale of conveyor belts and of hoses. And this is reflected in the profitability, it was down from EUR 563 million to EUR 527 million.\r\nFor ContiTech, this is including EUR 15 million costs for the acquisition of Veyance and it is including the reduction of the mining business, which is a very profitable part of the ContiTech business. For the tire business, it is obviously including the lower volumes which we have seen in the fourth quarter, and it is as well including those tailwinds from raw materials of EUR 40 million, which were basically compensated -- even a little bit overcompensated through the inventory valuation, which we had around EUR 50 million, like in the previous years.\r\nNevertheless, the margin in the Rubber Group in the fourth quarter was again higher than 15%.\r\nThe growth profile, again, in more detail, is shown on Page 7. The organic growth of our Automotive Group, and these are now full year numbers for 2014, achieved 6% compared to the passenger car and light truck production growth worldwide of 3%. In the passenger light truck tire, we grew by 3% while Europe was growing by 2% and North America was growing by 6%.\r\nContiTech sales only up 1%. And I mentioned, if you compare always somewhat difficult year compared to the car production in Europe and the GDP growth in Europe, I mentioned already the reason for this only 1% growth, on the one hand side, it is the conveyor belt which go into the mining business, and on the other hand side, it is the hoses, which go into the conveyor belt business. Overall, mining business at ContiTech was down about 12%, which made the whole industry part of ContiTech to be down by 7%.\r\nFinally, commercial vehicle tires, we were growing with 3%, while the volume growth in European markets was 1%; in North America, 8%.\r\nTo mention on the corporation highlights. We are a cost-focused company. This is true not only for the past. This is true as well for the present, as shown on Page 8. And here, we do compare our cost position in 2014 to the first time when Siemens VDO was included in the group, 2008. And our sales were growing since then by 42%, while the costs were only growing by 33%. And specifically, cost of sales and administrative costs were down, while R&D expense is relatively stable on sales. So we're increasing in that time by 42% in order to increase our innovative strength and build up business for the future, and as well our selling and logistics costs were even up by 40 basis points due to the expansion of tire distribution centers controls distribution mainly in Europe.\r\nPage 9 is explaining the difference of the adjusted and reported EBIT. No change in our criteria for the adjustment compared to previous years. Reported EBIT was, in 2014, EUR 3.3 billion. PPA was adjusted for, making up EUR 194 million. The biggest chunk out of it still PPA from the Siemens VDO acquisition, which, in most of it, was last time in 2014, so will no longer be there in 2015. Consolidation effect neglectable and then we have asset impairment, restructuring costs and other specialty effects in the sum of EUR 324 million. And most of these EUR 324 million, EUR 246 million out of it, are due to the onetime effects of Powertrain in the third quarter, which we reported about. 2 main reasons: the dissolution of the joint venture with SKI and the cleaning up around our injection pumps, which are still -- or were still based on the old Siemens VDO technology.\r\nI mentioned already the highlights on Page 10 shown in more detail, sustainable value creation. The ROCE achieved in 2014, 20%, 60 basis points up compared to already strong 2013. Of course, the increase in the EBIT is one factor and the other one, the operating assets remained stable at below EUR 17 billion, while at the same time the company was growing. And more than one time, I've pointed out already on the efforts at Continental on working capital management and overall on our concentration on good management of the operating assets.\r\nPage 11 is showing our maturities for the syndicated loans and the bonds and maturities. Obviously are no longer the biggest concern for us. The next maturity is in 2016. The term loan of EUR 1.5 billion from then on the next 4 years, each one was around EUR 750 million bond. The U.S. dollar bond here shown with EUR 782 million, $950 million, due in 2019, can be called first time in the third quarter of 2015. And in time, we will make up our mind if it makes sense to probably replace a new bond, prebuy it or leave it as it is.\r\nThe upper right is showing a table with liquidity numbers. Our total liquidity achieved EUR 7.3 billion in 2014 year-end, including a cash position of EUR 3.2 billion. This cash position is higher than our target rate of EUR 1.22 billion. As many of you know, main reason for that is we are prepared basically until the last day of 2014 to close the acquisition of Veyance and then would have needed, at this case, to pay for Veyance.\r\nBased on these numbers, Page 12, it is not surprising that the ratings which we get from the rating agencies are now matching our targets. The targets comparing H1 2009, so when our ratings were at the lowest point, to now, the ratings and the important ratios -- 2014 leverage ratio 4.55 and beginning of 2009; now we're at 0.39. So better than our target of being well below 1. The gearing ratio, 186%. Peak in H1 2009, 26% now, close to our target to be below 20%. Please don't take into account, though, that in the first quarter, we now will include Veyance with EUR 1.4 billion purchase price, so another EUR 1.4 billion to be added to our indebtedness. And equity ratio, up from 22% to 37%, as well above our target of at least 35%.\r\nThe rating agencies are reflecting these in their ratings. Fitch, since September in 2014, has a rating of BBB with a positive outlook. And S&P, since 2013, already at BBB. It's only Moody's which has with the Baa3, and a stable outlook still some parent subsidiary clause included in the rating and due to this, it's basically 1 notch below the other 2 rating agencies.\r\nI'm moving on to more details of the Automotive Group on Page 13. The left graph is showing the growth rates of the 3 Automotive divisions. Chassis & Safety growing with close to 5%. And this is the organic growth rate, and this is driven by strong growth in our advanced driver assistance system business on the one hand side. It's including as well, though, the fading out of our steering business, which we had announced in 2013. And this is an effect where roughly EUR 250 million of business are now over the next 4 to 5 years fading out and by that, of course, having a negative impact on the top line.\r\nPowertrain growth with -- organic growth with 2.9%. This is dampened by the old Siemens VDO-based technology order, which we did not finally not start producing in the second half of 2014 and some of the business which was delayed, we have reported on that some time. Nevertheless, we confirm that in 2015, we expect a growth rate of 5% and actually the first month of this year are confirming this.\r\nInterior business has constantly shown a strong growth throughout the full year in many of the business fields where Interior is working. So overall, Automotive Group was growing with 5.6% organically. \r\nAnd on the profitability side, Chassis & Safety, stable margin, 9.4% compared to the previous year 9.5%, including though 100 basis points more R&D than we had it in 2013, reflecting the buildup -- a strong buildup of the business in our advanced driver assistance system business, which is doubling within 2 years from EUR 500 million to EUR 1 billion. And the R&D costs are already now burdening the Chassis & Safety division.\r\nPowertrain margin of 4.1%, disappointing compared to the 5.1% we had already achieved last year. Please take into account that this includes EUR 87 million of onetimers from the old Siemens VDO technique business third quarter adjustments which we had done. And these EUR 87 million are included in the adjusted EBIT. If you would adjust for that, we would see a slight increase in the margin.  Nevertheless, in Powertrain, in 2014, this was not the strongest year, obviously, and below our expectation. But again, I reconfirm not only on sales growth, but as well on the EBIT development that this year, we should achieve the 8% margin, excluding the HEV business, which in 2014, has made losses of EUR 124 million.\r\nInterior was 10.1%, a nice increase compared to the 8.9% adjusted margin we saw in the year before, profiting from the restructuring in 2013 which we've done, and from the solid growth. CapEx is in line with 5.4% of sales with what we had announced and expected. And R&D is up in the Automotive divisions to 8.8% of sales.\r\nI have commented already on Page 14 on an earlier page and I will move to Page 15, sales growth profile of our Automotive Group. What the left graph shows, Continental, always the left part and the market's worldwide growth, it's always the right part. We were also following the markets in each quarter with an increasing trend in the last 3 quarters of the year. And on the right side, you see the growth rates for the 3 Automotive divisions. Powertrain, obviously, was dragging the total Automotive Group number down in Q3 and Q4. We have commented on the reasons, mainly, the successive businesses which did not come in, and again, reconfirming '15 targets.\r\nThe earnings quality in Automotive is strong. Specifically taking into account the left graph, that the R&D expenses, as mentioned, are up to 8.8% from the 7.9% a year earlier, and even lower numbers in the years before. This will allow us to even differentiate more than we do now, a strength in our innovative profile, and by that, generate profitable business in the next years to come.\r\nSales are regionally quite balanced. We have now 26% of our business in Asia, and we have 23% in NAFTA; Europe, Germany and the rest of Europe (sic) [world] together are below 50%. Value creation is accelerating as well in Automotive. In 2013, first time that we were above our estimated weighted average cost of capital with 10.6%, now even increased to 11.3%. And this number is including the onetimers in Powertrain of EUR 333 million. And please as well take into account, this includes EUR 5.5 billion goodwill. So half of the operating assets shown here are goodwill.\r\nJust to comment additionally on the sales share which we are showing in Asia, Page 17 is showing 2008, after the first full year inclusion of Siemens VDO business into our Automotive Group, we had, in Asia, share of 13%. We managed to double this share to 26% over those 6 years in between. And by that, are showing that our midterm target of 30% is on the way. And I'm sure, if not this year, we are on quite a good path in 2016 to achieve that. And of course, when we talked about headwind from exchange rates, those headwinds were as well a burden on the quarter of the non-European business.\r\nThe order intake in the Automotive Group was already mentioned was EUR 30 billion in 2014, a nice increase compared to the previous years. And the book-to-bill ratio in Chassis & Safety moved up to 1.3 with EUR 9.9 billion orders taken. Of course, advanced driver assistance systems with a book-to-bill ratio at 4.0, specifically big orders at Toyota were supporting this. Powertrain with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.7, specifically in engine systems, diesel and gasoline systems and sensors and actuators book-to-bill ratio of 2.0. And as well to mention, close to 40% of order intake was outside of Europe and NAFTA, which is today, 1/4 of the actual business 2014 of only 25%. So the structural increase in Powertrain in a more regionally better distributed sales line -- top line is on the way with these order intake. Interior, solid order backlog. It's evenly distributed amongst the various business units with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3. And 30% of the order intake was acquired in Asia, which today, sales share of Asia is only 22%.\r\nSo much for the Automotive Group. I move to the Rubber Group, and the same chart for the Rubber Group as we saw it at the Automotive Group before. Sales and profitability for our here 2 divisions. ContiTech growing with 1.3%. I commented on that already and repeated reduction in the conveyor belt business, 12%; mining business weak, similar in hoses, which made overall the industry business of ContiTech to be reduced by 7%. Now automotive and the aftermarket was growing strong, auto by plus 5% in the end, saw outcome ContiTech growth of 1.3%. And this is the main reason for the margin to be at 11.3% compared to the 12.1% of the previous year. Of course, it includes some onetimers for the Veyance acquisition. But an important factor is that -- was that the very profits -- above average profit to the mining business was structurally reduced.\r\nOn Tires, organic growth of 2.1%. And if you look at the top line and its various elements, volume was up by 3%. Price was down by 4%. Mix was up by 4%, so price mix balancing out as we saw it in the year before. And FX was dragging down by 2%, mix overall, plus 2%, the number which we're seeing there. The same numbers for the commercial vehicle business, plus 3% in volume, minus 3% in price, mix not relevant there, FX minus 1%, makes up for a minus 1% in that business.\r\nSo overall, the Rubber Group growing with 2.1% and 17.2% margin, which is then this margin compared to 16.9% the year before is driven by our tire business, where the 18.7% margin of 2013 could further be improved to 19.4%, EUR 190 million tailwind of raw materials has helped.\r\nOf course, mix improvement on Page 21 is one of the factors which helped to -- though we had the price down, helped to get the profitability further up. From the 128 million units sold, we had an average sales price in 2014 at EUR 61, which is unchanged from 2013. Now when you consider price down 4%, obviously mix was improving. And the share of our high-performance tires, which are all tires which are 17-inch and bigger, and winter tires was moving up over the last 2 years from 44% to 46%. However, if you look back over the last 4 years even by 7% -- 7% structurally, increased 7 percentage points. We managed last year still though the season was weak, as I said before, 22 million winter tires, nearly the same amount which we have sold in 2013. And our volume on the shelves of the dealers now seems to be okay, that because the sale of Continental winter tires in Europe was quite okay.\r\nWe reported in the Rubber Group on the replacement tire market that the European market, which is depicted on Page 22 on the left chart, was after a long period of declining numbers until mid of 2013, from then on a positive trend. Unfortunately, this trend did not continue in the fourth quarter of 2014 and neither in January '15. As you can see in this chart, I have mentioned already a minus 8%, very much driven by weak winter tire sales. This is not true for NAFTA and North America, which helped to compensate partly for this reduction in Europe. Markets were further strongly increasing; very strong in December. The ICT ruling had some effect on that whether we saw some pre-buy effect at the dealerships, and this is partly now compensated in January.\r\nRaw material prices are expected from our side to see some increase in the remainder of this year; we had very low volumes at the moment. Natural rubber price expected to average about $1.75 in '15, synthetic rubber forecasted to average USD 95 (sic) [ USD 0.95 ], we will still have some tailwind for the H1 in 2015 from raw materials, and then this compensated in some increase in the second half of the year. And the oil price reduction will have for each USD 1.10 decline from the oil price over the whole year will be a gross benefit of EUR 50 million for our tire division, and gross benefit in this case means the cost reduction. How much of this finally will stay with Continental and not had to pass over in our price to the dealers remains to be seen.\r\nWe have finally, Page 24, closed the Veyance acquisition. The sales contribution from Veyance in 2015 for the 11 months, where we will include it, will amount to around EUR 1.3 billion. The adjusted EBITDA margin, which we expected in the first year, now 2015, is around 8%, which includes synergies and as well, of course, the integration costs in the first year. And there will be PPA on intangibles, which is amortized about 11 years of EUR 100 million in the first 5 years. Overall, the intangible assets are ending up at EUR 725 million. So the biggest chunk of it will be amortized in the first 5 years.\r\nBy the way, the goodwill stemming out of this acquisition is EUR 435 million. Veyance will add, though, about EUR 1.5 billion to the operating assets.\r\nIn the midterm, ContiTech EBIT margins should be restored to 12% and ContiTech ROCE will improve to 20% and above that, while in 2015, after the strongest position, it might be slightly below 15%.\r\nThe closing in January included our obligation to sell 2 smaller operations in Mexico and in Brazil of air springs and conveyor belts. Together, they have sales of clearly below EUR 100 million and profitability which was below the average of the Veyance group. We are working on that and we'll do that as fast as possible.\r\nMoving finally to some numbers of the group, starting with indebtedness and cash flow. The net indebtedness bridge; we started the full year 2014 with EUR 4.289 million in indebtedness, dividend EUR 500 million, added to that CapEx of EUR 2.1 billion, and then the working capital outflow of EUR 270 million. Depreciation and amortization EUR 1.8 billion and then basically the net income of EUR 2.4 billion made up now for the EUR 2.8 billion of net indebtedness at the end of 2014. I mentioned already 26% gearing ratio. Again, this is not including Veyance which only is added to the company in January.\r\nPage 26 showing these numbers again with a nice development over the last years. EUR 10 billion reduction in net indebtedness over the last 6 years, just reconfirming the strength in cash generation which the company definitely has.\r\nPage 27, it's showing the cash conversion ratio, just confirming what I was saying. 85% of the cash flow before financing activities could be converted into -- sorry, 85% of our net income in 2014 could be converted into free cash flow. And again, this is the concentration of the company on working capital management, on operating assets and it has to achieve ratios like I was just mentioning.\r\nOverview of the cash flow shown on Page 28. Operating activities cash flow in the year 2014 compared to 2013, stronger investment as well higher as the company was growing. Nevertheless, free cash flow was more than EUR 2 billion on a record level. The quarterly distribution of our cash flow is very much mirroring our normal seasonality with each quarter in the end free cash flow generated -- strongest cash flow generated, as always, in Q4.\r\nThe sources of our gross indebtedness are shown on Page 29. Gross indebtedness is EUR 6.4 billion, which is, as a major financing source, the wider capital market, EUR 3.1 billion in bonds, then an additional EUR 1.5 billion term loan. And just to comment, other indebtedness, EUR 950 million, the majority of that is ABS programs with EUR 840 million and there's another EUR 110 million, which are mainly finance lease. We have no -- as we did not have in the past, we have no off balance sheet financing.\r\nAnd this leads me to our outlook for 2015. We do see the European production slightly increasing. This is -- Europe is including the weak market in Russia, which will stay weak from our expectations as well in 2015. So Europe growing slightly with -- in some quarters 0 and then up to 2%. North America, further growth, we expect North America to grow in basically all quarters beside the second one, which last year was a strong quarter after the strong winter 2013, there was a pent-up demand in the second quarter. Now for the right, expectation of further growth in North America to a record level of 17.3 million cars produced. And you can see in this chart how we expect this to be distributed over the quarters to come, and it leads me to our overall market expectation. Europe will grow with 1% to EUR 19.9 million; North America to the EUR 17.3 million, which I just mentioned 2% growth; South America is still weak, EUR 3.7 million; and Asia up 4% specifically, including the Chinese market with another growth of 8%. So worldwide 2% growth, 87 million to 89 million units produced.\r\nThe replacement tire markets, 2% growth in Europe; 1% growth in North America; South America, stable; and Asia, up 6%. On the commercial vehicle, this year, we do expect growth in all world regions, strongest in North America. And on the CV replacement tire market, growth in Europe and in North America, some reduction in South America due to the weak economic situation there and the growth in Asia.\r\nWhich, in these environment, leads to our expectation for Continental. We expect our sales to increase to EUR 37.5 billion. And in addition to that, there is up to EUR 1 billion tailwind from FX to be expected, and this is assuming that the FX rates are on a level which is around the level we have seen in the last 6 months.\r\nWe expect an adjusted EBITDA margin of more than 10.5%. For the Automotive Group, this means sales of more than EUR 22 billion, growth of more than 5% and adjusted EBITDA margin of more than 8.5%. For the Rubber Group, sales of more than EUR 15 billion. This is a plus 10% and including, obviously the Veyance acquisition with an adjusted EBIT margin of about 15%. Raw material costs do not affect the Rubber Group's EBIT line. We do expect special effects about EUR 100 million like we normally do expect for a group of our size and structure. Net interest shall be around EUR 300 million, including the financing of the Veyance tier tax rate at around 30%. Capital expenditures at around 6%, similar to previous year number; and PPA in ContiTech about EUR 105 million, which is the biggest part of the PPA now, I mentioned already Siemens VDO PPA basically out of our books. And then finally, free cash flow before acquisitions expected to be at least at EUR 1.5 billion.\r\nSo much from my side as comments on the full year numbers 2014 and our expectation for this year. And now, of course, we are open to take your questions.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Rolf Woller (Executives)】\nHoney, thanks. Hi and hello, everyone. A warm welcome to all of you to our Full Year Results Analyst and Investor Conference Call. We hope all of you have somehow digested the massive news flow on the sector over the last couple of weeks.\r\nAs always, before we start I have to mention first that you should have received by mail the link to our press release, to our preliminary consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2014, as well as the analyst and investor presentation. If you did not receive any of the aforementioned, please visit our IR website.\r\nIf you're already using a tablet-only, you can have a look at the Conti IR and you will find all the material available already there.\r\nIn the course of this afternoon, the tale of 2014 will also be available on our website for download.\r\nI should also make you aware of Page 34 in the presentation, which contains our disclaimer. And last but not least, you can also follow this conference call via webcast.\r\nAs in the last 5 years, we start with the presentation, which is given by our CFO, Wolfgang Schafer, who is next to me sitting here in the room in Hanover together with my colleagues from Media Relations and from Treasury and Finance. We will host a Q&A after the presentation. And after the call, the IR team will be available and ready to clarify any open questions you might have.\r\nSo my name is Rolf Woller, and I hand over to Wolfgang that he can start with the interesting part of this call. Wolfgang, please go ahead.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nWelcome to all of you. And before I guide you through the presentation, let me remind you of the Q4 market environment last year. Global car production was flat in the last quarter of 2014. Europe was down 2%. This includes Russia with minus 32% in the fourth quarter and France was minus 5%. And this was compensated outside of Europe with China and the U.S. market, which were each growing by 5%. Replacement tire markets were even weaker. Mild winter in Europe made the market plunged to minus 8% and the stronger North American market could go only partly compensate that.\r\nNow how does this continue into 2015? We see the production in Q1 slightly up from the fourth quarter levels in Europe, but not as strong as hoped. New car sales trend in Europe, though, is making us confident that this should change in the next coming weeks or months and have a positive impact then on the production.\r\nThe tire markets in Europe remained weak at the start of 2015. Nevertheless, we can say that against this backdrop, we had a favorable start into the year confirming our close to double-digits sales growth expectation for the full year of 2015.\r\nFor other corporation highlights, I'm moving to Page 3 of the presentation. Our sales were up by 4% to EUR 34.5 billion, including a negative FX impact of EUR 470 million. The adjusted EBIT was up by 4% to EUR 3.9 billion with a margin at 11.3% compared to the 11.2% of 2013. The net income was up by 24% to EUR 2.4 billion, mainly due to massive reduction of our interest of more than EUR 500 million to minus EUR 265 million. Main reason for this is the early redemption and the partly replacements of our bonds in 2013, which positively influenced 2014, and which will have a lasting effect in 2015 following.\r\nFree cash flow amounted to EUR 2 billion, up 11%, all-time record for Continental. And the net indebtedness, consequently, goes down to EUR 2.8 billion, achieving a gearing ratio of 26%, equity ratio at the company at around 37%.\r\nWe managed to create sustainably value and the trailing ROCE was up by another 60 basis points to now our target rate of 20%.\r\nAnd 3 other topics I would like to mention under the most important KPIs of the full year. The acquisition volume in our Automotive Group achieved a new record with EUR 30 billion lifetime sales, which we managed to acquire last year. We finally closed the Veyance acquisition on January 30, 2015. And the third point to mention, our boards will recommend to the annual shareholder meeting to pay a dividend of EUR 3.25, an increase of 30% from last year.\r\nA closer look on the sales and the adjusted EBIT of the group is presented on Page 5. First, you -- if you have a look at the last 4 columns of the slide, you can see the nice increase quarter-over-quarter, which we have shown in our sales development. The fourth quarter was EUR 8.9 billion, EUR 500 million up to the previous year, organically flat 3%, and the adjusted EBIT margin in the last quarter at 10.8%.\r\nThe development of the Auto and the Rubber Group in the fourth quarter was quite different though. And to get more view on that, I move to Page 6. And the left graph is showing the development of the Automotive Group. There, the organic growth was 5% or EUR 5.4 billion, which is a nominal increase of 9%, and the adjusted EBIT was up to EUR 455 million, plus 11%, increasing the margin, again compared to the quarter of the previous year, from 8.2% to 8.4%.\r\nAnd different to Automotive, the Rubber Group growth was quite modest, only plus 2%, mainly 2 reasons for that. Weak replacement tire markets, Europe -- European replacement tire markets, minus 8% in the fourth quarter. I've mentioned this already, and on the quantity side, still, it's a weak mining business, which is affecting the sale of conveyor belts and of hoses. And this is reflected in the profitability, it was down from EUR 563 million to EUR 527 million.\r\nFor ContiTech, this is including EUR 15 million costs for the acquisition of Veyance and it is including the reduction of the mining business, which is a very profitable part of the ContiTech business. For the tire business, it is obviously including the lower volumes which we have seen in the fourth quarter, and it is as well including those tailwinds from raw materials of EUR 40 million, which were basically compensated -- even a little bit overcompensated through the inventory valuation, which we had around EUR 50 million, like in the previous years.\r\nNevertheless, the margin in the Rubber Group in the fourth quarter was again higher than 15%.\r\nThe growth profile, again, in more detail, is shown on Page 7. The organic growth of our Automotive Group, and these are now full year numbers for 2014, achieved 6% compared to the passenger car and light truck production growth worldwide of 3%. In the passenger light truck tire, we grew by 3% while Europe was growing by 2% and North America was growing by 6%.\r\nContiTech sales only up 1%. And I mentioned, if you compare always somewhat difficult year compared to the car production in Europe and the GDP growth in Europe, I mentioned already the reason for this only 1% growth, on the one hand side, it is the conveyor belt which go into the mining business, and on the other hand side, it is the hoses, which go into the conveyor belt business. Overall, mining business at ContiTech was down about 12%, which made the whole industry part of ContiTech to be down by 7%.\r\nFinally, commercial vehicle tires, we were growing with 3%, while the volume growth in European markets was 1%; in North America, 8%.\r\nTo mention on the corporation highlights. We are a cost-focused company. This is true not only for the past. This is true as well for the present, as shown on Page 8. And here, we do compare our cost position in 2014 to the first time when Siemens VDO was included in the group, 2008. And our sales were growing since then by 42%, while the costs were only growing by 33%. And specifically, cost of sales and administrative costs were down, while R&D expense is relatively stable on sales. So we're increasing in that time by 42% in order to increase our innovative strength and build up business for the future, and as well our selling and logistics costs were even up by 40 basis points due to the expansion of tire distribution centers controls distribution mainly in Europe.\r\nPage 9 is explaining the difference of the adjusted and reported EBIT. No change in our criteria for the adjustment compared to previous years. Reported EBIT was, in 2014, EUR 3.3 billion. PPA was adjusted for, making up EUR 194 million. The biggest chunk out of it still PPA from the Siemens VDO acquisition, which, in most of it, was last time in 2014, so will no longer be there in 2015. Consolidation effect neglectable and then we have asset impairment, restructuring costs and other specialty effects in the sum of EUR 324 million. And most of these EUR 324 million, EUR 246 million out of it, are due to the onetime effects of Powertrain in the third quarter, which we reported about. 2 main reasons: the dissolution of the joint venture with SKI and the cleaning up around our injection pumps, which are still -- or were still based on the old Siemens VDO technology.\r\nI mentioned already the highlights on Page 10 shown in more detail, sustainable value creation. The ROCE achieved in 2014, 20%, 60 basis points up compared to already strong 2013. Of course, the increase in the EBIT is one factor and the other one, the operating assets remained stable at below EUR 17 billion, while at the same time the company was growing. And more than one time, I've pointed out already on the efforts at Continental on working capital management and overall on our concentration on good management of the operating assets.\r\nPage 11 is showing our maturities for the syndicated loans and the bonds and maturities. Obviously are no longer the biggest concern for us. The next maturity is in 2016. The term loan of EUR 1.5 billion from then on the next 4 years, each one was around EUR 750 million bond. The U.S. dollar bond here shown with EUR 782 million, $950 million, due in 2019, can be called first time in the third quarter of 2015. And in time, we will make up our mind if it makes sense to probably replace a new bond, prebuy it or leave it as it is.\r\nThe upper right is showing a table with liquidity numbers. Our total liquidity achieved EUR 7.3 billion in 2014 year-end, including a cash position of EUR 3.2 billion. This cash position is higher than our target rate of EUR 1.22 billion. As many of you know, main reason for that is we are prepared basically until the last day of 2014 to close the acquisition of Veyance and then would have needed, at this case, to pay for Veyance.\r\nBased on these numbers, Page 12, it is not surprising that the ratings which we get from the rating agencies are now matching our targets. The targets comparing H1 2009, so when our ratings were at the lowest point, to now, the ratings and the important ratios -- 2014 leverage ratio 4.55 and beginning of 2009; now we're at 0.39. So better than our target of being well below 1. The gearing ratio, 186%. Peak in H1 2009, 26% now, close to our target to be below 20%. Please don't take into account, though, that in the first quarter, we now will include Veyance with EUR 1.4 billion purchase price, so another EUR 1.4 billion to be added to our indebtedness. And equity ratio, up from 22% to 37%, as well above our target of at least 35%.\r\nThe rating agencies are reflecting these in their ratings. Fitch, since September in 2014, has a rating of BBB with a positive outlook. And S&P, since 2013, already at BBB. It's only Moody's which has with the Baa3, and a stable outlook still some parent subsidiary clause included in the rating and due to this, it's basically 1 notch below the other 2 rating agencies.\r\nI'm moving on to more details of the Automotive Group on Page 13. The left graph is showing the growth rates of the 3 Automotive divisions. Chassis & Safety growing with close to 5%. And this is the organic growth rate, and this is driven by strong growth in our advanced driver assistance system business on the one hand side. It's including as well, though, the fading out of our steering business, which we had announced in 2013. And this is an effect where roughly EUR 250 million of business are now over the next 4 to 5 years fading out and by that, of course, having a negative impact on the top line.\r\nPowertrain growth with -- organic growth with 2.9%. This is dampened by the old Siemens VDO-based technology order, which we did not finally not start producing in the second half of 2014 and some of the business which was delayed, we have reported on that some time. Nevertheless, we confirm that in 2015, we expect a growth rate of 5% and actually the first month of this year are confirming this.\r\nInterior business has constantly shown a strong growth throughout the full year in many of the business fields where Interior is working. So overall, Automotive Group was growing with 5.6% organically. \r\nAnd on the profitability side, Chassis & Safety, stable margin, 9.4% compared to the previous year 9.5%, including though 100 basis points more R&D than we had it in 2013, reflecting the buildup -- a strong buildup of the business in our advanced driver assistance system business, which is doubling within 2 years from EUR 500 million to EUR 1 billion. And the R&D costs are already now burdening the Chassis & Safety division.\r\nPowertrain margin of 4.1%, disappointing compared to the 5.1% we had already achieved last year. Please take into account that this includes EUR 87 million of onetimers from the old Siemens VDO technique business third quarter adjustments which we had done. And these EUR 87 million are included in the adjusted EBIT. If you would adjust for that, we would see a slight increase in the margin.  Nevertheless, in Powertrain, in 2014, this was not the strongest year, obviously, and below our expectation. But again, I reconfirm not only on sales growth, but as well on the EBIT development that this year, we should achieve the 8% margin, excluding the HEV business, which in 2014, has made losses of EUR 124 million.\r\nInterior was 10.1%, a nice increase compared to the 8.9% adjusted margin we saw in the year before, profiting from the restructuring in 2013 which we've done, and from the solid growth. CapEx is in line with 5.4% of sales with what we had announced and expected. And R&D is up in the Automotive divisions to 8.8% of sales.\r\nI have commented already on Page 14 on an earlier page and I will move to Page 15, sales growth profile of our Automotive Group. What the left graph shows, Continental, always the left part and the market's worldwide growth, it's always the right part. We were also following the markets in each quarter with an increasing trend in the last 3 quarters of the year. And on the right side, you see the growth rates for the 3 Automotive divisions. Powertrain, obviously, was dragging the total Automotive Group number down in Q3 and Q4. We have commented on the reasons, mainly, the successive businesses which did not come in, and again, reconfirming '15 targets.\r\nThe earnings quality in Automotive is strong. Specifically taking into account the left graph, that the R&D expenses, as mentioned, are up to 8.8% from the 7.9% a year earlier, and even lower numbers in the years before. This will allow us to even differentiate more than we do now, a strength in our innovative profile, and by that, generate profitable business in the next years to come.\r\nSales are regionally quite balanced. We have now 26% of our business in Asia, and we have 23% in NAFTA; Europe, Germany and the rest of Europe (sic) [world] together are below 50%. Value creation is accelerating as well in Automotive. In 2013, first time that we were above our estimated weighted average cost of capital with 10.6%, now even increased to 11.3%. And this number is including the onetimers in Powertrain of EUR 333 million. And please as well take into account, this includes EUR 5.5 billion goodwill. So half of the operating assets shown here are goodwill.\r\nJust to comment additionally on the sales share which we are showing in Asia, Page 17 is showing 2008, after the first full year inclusion of Siemens VDO business into our Automotive Group, we had, in Asia, share of 13%. We managed to double this share to 26% over those 6 years in between. And by that, are showing that our midterm target of 30% is on the way. And I'm sure, if not this year, we are on quite a good path in 2016 to achieve that. And of course, when we talked about headwind from exchange rates, those headwinds were as well a burden on the quarter of the non-European business.\r\nThe order intake in the Automotive Group was already mentioned was EUR 30 billion in 2014, a nice increase compared to the previous years. And the book-to-bill ratio in Chassis & Safety moved up to 1.3 with EUR 9.9 billion orders taken. Of course, advanced driver assistance systems with a book-to-bill ratio at 4.0, specifically big orders at Toyota were supporting this. Powertrain with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.7, specifically in engine systems, diesel and gasoline systems and sensors and actuators book-to-bill ratio of 2.0. And as well to mention, close to 40% of order intake was outside of Europe and NAFTA, which is today, 1/4 of the actual business 2014 of only 25%. So the structural increase in Powertrain in a more regionally better distributed sales line -- top line is on the way with these order intake. Interior, solid order backlog. It's evenly distributed amongst the various business units with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3. And 30% of the order intake was acquired in Asia, which today, sales share of Asia is only 22%.\r\nSo much for the Automotive Group. I move to the Rubber Group, and the same chart for the Rubber Group as we saw it at the Automotive Group before. Sales and profitability for our here 2 divisions. ContiTech growing with 1.3%. I commented on that already and repeated reduction in the conveyor belt business, 12%; mining business weak, similar in hoses, which made overall the industry business of ContiTech to be reduced by 7%. Now automotive and the aftermarket was growing strong, auto by plus 5% in the end, saw outcome ContiTech growth of 1.3%. And this is the main reason for the margin to be at 11.3% compared to the 12.1% of the previous year. Of course, it includes some onetimers for the Veyance acquisition. But an important factor is that -- was that the very profits -- above average profit to the mining business was structurally reduced.\r\nOn Tires, organic growth of 2.1%. And if you look at the top line and its various elements, volume was up by 3%. Price was down by 4%. Mix was up by 4%, so price mix balancing out as we saw it in the year before. And FX was dragging down by 2%, mix overall, plus 2%, the number which we're seeing there. The same numbers for the commercial vehicle business, plus 3% in volume, minus 3% in price, mix not relevant there, FX minus 1%, makes up for a minus 1% in that business.\r\nSo overall, the Rubber Group growing with 2.1% and 17.2% margin, which is then this margin compared to 16.9% the year before is driven by our tire business, where the 18.7% margin of 2013 could further be improved to 19.4%, EUR 190 million tailwind of raw materials has helped.\r\nOf course, mix improvement on Page 21 is one of the factors which helped to -- though we had the price down, helped to get the profitability further up. From the 128 million units sold, we had an average sales price in 2014 at EUR 61, which is unchanged from 2013. Now when you consider price down 4%, obviously mix was improving. And the share of our high-performance tires, which are all tires which are 17-inch and bigger, and winter tires was moving up over the last 2 years from 44% to 46%. However, if you look back over the last 4 years even by 7% -- 7% structurally, increased 7 percentage points. We managed last year still though the season was weak, as I said before, 22 million winter tires, nearly the same amount which we have sold in 2013. And our volume on the shelves of the dealers now seems to be okay, that because the sale of Continental winter tires in Europe was quite okay.\r\nWe reported in the Rubber Group on the replacement tire market that the European market, which is depicted on Page 22 on the left chart, was after a long period of declining numbers until mid of 2013, from then on a positive trend. Unfortunately, this trend did not continue in the fourth quarter of 2014 and neither in January '15. As you can see in this chart, I have mentioned already a minus 8%, very much driven by weak winter tire sales. This is not true for NAFTA and North America, which helped to compensate partly for this reduction in Europe. Markets were further strongly increasing; very strong in December. The ICT ruling had some effect on that whether we saw some pre-buy effect at the dealerships, and this is partly now compensated in January.\r\nRaw material prices are expected from our side to see some increase in the remainder of this year; we had very low volumes at the moment. Natural rubber price expected to average about $1.75 in '15, synthetic rubber forecasted to average USD 95 (sic) [ USD 0.95 ], we will still have some tailwind for the H1 in 2015 from raw materials, and then this compensated in some increase in the second half of the year. And the oil price reduction will have for each USD 1.10 decline from the oil price over the whole year will be a gross benefit of EUR 50 million for our tire division, and gross benefit in this case means the cost reduction. How much of this finally will stay with Continental and not had to pass over in our price to the dealers remains to be seen.\r\nWe have finally, Page 24, closed the Veyance acquisition. The sales contribution from Veyance in 2015 for the 11 months, where we will include it, will amount to around EUR 1.3 billion. The adjusted EBITDA margin, which we expected in the first year, now 2015, is around 8%, which includes synergies and as well, of course, the integration costs in the first year. And there will be PPA on intangibles, which is amortized about 11 years of EUR 100 million in the first 5 years. Overall, the intangible assets are ending up at EUR 725 million. So the biggest chunk of it will be amortized in the first 5 years.\r\nBy the way, the goodwill stemming out of this acquisition is EUR 435 million. Veyance will add, though, about EUR 1.5 billion to the operating assets.\r\nIn the midterm, ContiTech EBIT margins should be restored to 12% and ContiTech ROCE will improve to 20% and above that, while in 2015, after the strongest position, it might be slightly below 15%.\r\nThe closing in January included our obligation to sell 2 smaller operations in Mexico and in Brazil of air springs and conveyor belts. Together, they have sales of clearly below EUR 100 million and profitability which was below the average of the Veyance group. We are working on that and we'll do that as fast as possible.\r\nMoving finally to some numbers of the group, starting with indebtedness and cash flow. The net indebtedness bridge; we started the full year 2014 with EUR 4.289 million in indebtedness, dividend EUR 500 million, added to that CapEx of EUR 2.1 billion, and then the working capital outflow of EUR 270 million. Depreciation and amortization EUR 1.8 billion and then basically the net income of EUR 2.4 billion made up now for the EUR 2.8 billion of net indebtedness at the end of 2014. I mentioned already 26% gearing ratio. Again, this is not including Veyance which only is added to the company in January.\r\nPage 26 showing these numbers again with a nice development over the last years. EUR 10 billion reduction in net indebtedness over the last 6 years, just reconfirming the strength in cash generation which the company definitely has.\r\nPage 27, it's showing the cash conversion ratio, just confirming what I was saying. 85% of the cash flow before financing activities could be converted into -- sorry, 85% of our net income in 2014 could be converted into free cash flow. And again, this is the concentration of the company on working capital management, on operating assets and it has to achieve ratios like I was just mentioning.\r\nOverview of the cash flow shown on Page 28. Operating activities cash flow in the year 2014 compared to 2013, stronger investment as well higher as the company was growing. Nevertheless, free cash flow was more than EUR 2 billion on a record level. The quarterly distribution of our cash flow is very much mirroring our normal seasonality with each quarter in the end free cash flow generated -- strongest cash flow generated, as always, in Q4.\r\nThe sources of our gross indebtedness are shown on Page 29. Gross indebtedness is EUR 6.4 billion, which is, as a major financing source, the wider capital market, EUR 3.1 billion in bonds, then an additional EUR 1.5 billion term loan. And just to comment, other indebtedness, EUR 950 million, the majority of that is ABS programs with EUR 840 million and there's another EUR 110 million, which are mainly finance lease. We have no -- as we did not have in the past, we have no off balance sheet financing.\r\nAnd this leads me to our outlook for 2015. We do see the European production slightly increasing. This is -- Europe is including the weak market in Russia, which will stay weak from our expectations as well in 2015. So Europe growing slightly with -- in some quarters 0 and then up to 2%. North America, further growth, we expect North America to grow in basically all quarters beside the second one, which last year was a strong quarter after the strong winter 2013, there was a pent-up demand in the second quarter. Now for the right, expectation of further growth in North America to a record level of 17.3 million cars produced. And you can see in this chart how we expect this to be distributed over the quarters to come, and it leads me to our overall market expectation. Europe will grow with 1% to EUR 19.9 million; North America to the EUR 17.3 million, which I just mentioned 2% growth; South America is still weak, EUR 3.7 million; and Asia up 4% specifically, including the Chinese market with another growth of 8%. So worldwide 2% growth, 87 million to 89 million units produced.\r\nThe replacement tire markets, 2% growth in Europe; 1% growth in North America; South America, stable; and Asia, up 6%. On the commercial vehicle, this year, we do expect growth in all world regions, strongest in North America. And on the CV replacement tire market, growth in Europe and in North America, some reduction in South America due to the weak economic situation there and the growth in Asia.\r\nWhich, in these environment, leads to our expectation for Continental. We expect our sales to increase to EUR 37.5 billion. And in addition to that, there is up to EUR 1 billion tailwind from FX to be expected, and this is assuming that the FX rates are on a level which is around the level we have seen in the last 6 months.\r\nWe expect an adjusted EBITDA margin of more than 10.5%. For the Automotive Group, this means sales of more than EUR 22 billion, growth of more than 5% and adjusted EBITDA margin of more than 8.5%. For the Rubber Group, sales of more than EUR 15 billion. This is a plus 10% and including, obviously the Veyance acquisition with an adjusted EBIT margin of about 15%. Raw material costs do not affect the Rubber Group's EBIT line. We do expect special effects about EUR 100 million like we normally do expect for a group of our size and structure. Net interest shall be around EUR 300 million, including the financing of the Veyance tier tax rate at around 30%. Capital expenditures at around 6%, similar to previous year number; and PPA in ContiTech about EUR 105 million, which is the biggest part of the PPA now, I mentioned already Siemens VDO PPA basically out of our books. And then finally, free cash flow before acquisitions expected to be at least at EUR 1.5 billion.\r\nSo much from my side as comments on the full year numbers 2014 and our expectation for this year. And now, of course, we are open to take your questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "This is Alex Haissl at Crédit Suisse. Three questions, if I may. First one on the costs side. I mean, we have seen quite significant increase in R&D costs in the Automotive business of 90 basis points, and also on the group level, SG&A costs up 40 basis points year-over-year. Can you help us out a little bit in terms of modeling what we can expect in particular for the R&D costs, given for Powertrain, these costs should come down, given the statements you made at the Capital Markets Day? My second question is also on the cost side or CapEx side. You indicate CapEx's percentages of sales still at 6%, given tire CapEx is slowing by almost 100 basis points year-over-year, and also Veyance is less capital intensive, if I take ContiTech as a proxy. So where is the incremental CapEx going? Is it the Auto business that we can expect higher CapEx figures for the Auto business here? And my last question is on the tire business. Can you give us an update on the Russia and the U.S. ramp-up? What we can expect year-over-year incremental volumes?\n\n---\n\nOn the cost side, R&D up 90 basis points in Automotive. We expect that this level is the level which you can expect now for the year 2015. But please take into account there is a little bit already including structural changes in our business. Where the gross margin is increasing, we have less investments in hardware, structurally a little bit. And then by that, replaced by more software and R&D. So it's partly a structural change.\r\nThe sales costs are increasing, as I've mentioned, due to the fact that we have, via acquisition, included more distribution channels, controlled distribution, which will help to increase our market share in the next years. And this is a constant program. But I am, for this year, not foreseeing a bigger change in the additional of further sales channels, but if there would be a change or an opportunity for us, we will definitely have a close look at it. And if it's priced right and structurally okay, we might add that, and that could increase again the SG&A share of our cost. And on the cost side, you're right. CapEx, at the tires side, including ContiTech, can be a little bit weaker. But as soon as we have to invest further, and specifically in truck tire business, the number can go up again. And this is very much depending on the market development over the next time. Plus, we have seen strong order intake in Automotive. This can well -- as well have some effect on the investment quota now in Automotive for future business. So the about 6% number is a number which, I think, will materialize in 2015. Tires ramp-up in Russia and in the U.S., Kaluga and Sumter. We talked about the 1.3 million tires which we have produced in Kaluga in 2014, above 1 million -- a little bit more than 1 million in 2014 in Sumter. These numbers will move up in Sumter to 2.5 million in 2015 and in Kaluga to about 2 million. And Kaluga, specifically, is still mostly replacing imports, which up to now, we have done into the market from other Eastern European companies. And it might be that we do some export to Northern Europe from Kaluga, profiting from the poor export-accelerated exchange rate of Kaluga.\n\n---\n\nI've got just one quick follow-up question on the R&D spend what you mentioned for the Automotive business. When I look at the outperformance of the Automotive business versus the market, it's 200 to 300 basis points. It's clearly at the lower end of what you've indicated in the past, up to 500 basis points, largely due to the Powertrain business. So when can we expect Conti, basically, to move again up to the upper end in terms of outperformance versus the market? What's the compression? What's the visibility that you have coming from the order bookings?\n\n---\n\nRight. So we should be back to the numbers which we have seen in years before in 2015. And specifically, as I can confirm that Powertrain is having a good start in the year and the 5% which we announced already in Regensburg at the third quarter conference is materializing. And this, as you rightly stated, was the drag on the growth in the Automotive area.\n\n---\n\nIt's Philip here from Citi. I was most interested in the 2020 revenue guidance. I was just wondering if you could, perhaps, elaborate on the assumptions there. I think -- I've read the press release, so it talks about a certain number of light vehicles. But are there any material acquisitions included in that beyond Veyance? And secondly, if I may, on FX. I think I've heard you say you're pretty much hedged in relation to year dollar moves at the EBIT line. Is that -- are you very confident that's going to be the case in 2015? And finally, actually just on pricing for each tire, I don't know if you've got a good feel for where replacement pricing might be in 2015.\n\n---\n\nAnd the EUR 50 billion which we talked about this morning in the annual press conference is based on a car production of about 100 -- a little bit above 100 million cars. And it does not include -- I think there was some, probably, misunderstanding this morning, this does not include major M&A deals. Of course, it includes -- and this was the message we were giving, of course, this includes already Veyance because we know that we do have Veyance for these numbers. But it does not include -- it's not external growth. It is internal growth, which we expect based on our orders on book and our expected development. The euro-dollar profit hedge, not only euro-dollar, all our currency hedge which we have proven in the last 2 years, we do expect to hold as well for 2015. And again here, we have the first 2 months, and I reconfirm that. And then your third question, which was on...\n\n---\n\nYes, it was on replacement, and if you were feeling good on replacement.\n\n---\n\nYes, pricing on tires. While we do see price pressure in Europe on tires, which is a little bit stronger than we had expected before, we do see quite low price pressure though in the U.S., which in the end leaves our expectation of a price down of about 4% in 2015.\n\n---\n\nIs the Chinese situation having an impact in Europe? The fact that Chinese tires have been less attractive in the U.S.\n\n---\n\nThe Chinese import, it's too early to tell. We did not see the numbers for -- the final numbers for January, February, and the indications we have are not sufficient to answer that question.\n\n---\n\nIt's Horst here from HSBC. A follow-up question on this translation effect that you calculate. I just want to ask if I got it right, so that you calculate the EUR 1 billion translation effect that you potentially see for '15 on the basis of the average U.S. dollar rate of the last 6 months, is that right?\n\n---\n\nWell, it is our -- this is not only U.S. dollar. We have about more than 20 currencies, and there is the effect of Eastern European currencies is important as well, as we have production sites there, and you know that sales are more in Euro from there or even in other currency. Overall, our expectation for this year is the EUR 1 billion and to remind you, last year, at the same time, we had said the expectation is EUR 700 million for 2014. We came out with EUR 460 million. I think -- so this was the forecast, which was quite okay. At the moment, I think the EUR 1 billion is a realistic number, of course, more of it to be seen in the first 3 quarters, and then the fourth quarter is where the currencies, the euro was already getting weaker and the currencies were already changing. That will be less than we expected then in Q4.\n\n---\n\nBut I mean, if I you take alone, for example, for the U.S. dollars, the average change over the last 6 months, you should assume a U.S. dollar-euro rate of USD 1.20. So we are now at USD 1.10. So that means -- what I want to know, if the currency rate stays where it is today at USD 1.10, USD 1.11, the translation effect potentially could be much bigger. I know it's not in your forecast. But if the currency -- if the euro remained as weak as it is, is that calculation right?\n\n---\n\nBut if you take again one single currency out of the set of our currencies...\n\n---\n\nBut it's the most important for you, right, the dollar?\n\n---\n\nNo, no, it's not the -- the euro-dollar is not necessarily the most important. There is, as I've mentioned before, as well other Eastern European currencies, specifically on the hedge for the cost and sales side. So if the dollar would stay on this number, the number, the EUR 1 billion, might be a little bit higher. But, I mean, we do foresee and expect at the moment, the EUR 1 billion.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So in the last question -- or another question that I have is on European production. You only give this guidance including Russia, which drags down the European number in total. I want to know what you assume for the EU-28 countries in terms of production. Market gross?\n\n---\n\nSchneider, I do have the Russia number which we assumed for 2015. I'm just looking in the table [ph], another minus 20% is included for the Russian production in these numbers. I don't have now Europe without Russia here in the numbers, but...\n\n---\n\nSo -- but would you agree that the start to the year, especially in Europe, has been stronger than you would have expected at end of last year?\n\n---\n\nWell, this is -- Schneider, this new car sales. There you're right. We do not see this in the production numbers. But, I mean, new car sales are a good indication that the car production should increase as well.\n\n---\n\nAll right. And then the very last question that I have is, it was an interesting statement that you made on the order intake and that a big part of that came from Asia, and you also mentioned Toyota, and I also heard that from some smaller suppliers that, basically, I mean, it is said for some time now that Toyota is getting more open towards Western suppliers. Do you see significant upside from that perspective, especially with Japanese carmakers? Or is that a little bit too optimistic to state?\n\n---\n\nNo, no, no, this is completely right. We do see quite some increase in our sales with Japanese OEs, so not our sales in Japan, but with Japanese OEs worldwide have a good chance to double over the next 4 to 5 years. And this is really an achievement which finally comes through; as you were rightly saying, they are more open to the Westerners.\n\n---\n\nWhere does the share stand right now? Just on an aggregate; you don't have to mention it for a specific carmaker.\n\n---\n\nAnd the share of our automotive sales, yes, it's below 10% -- I mean, to all Japanese OEs, it's about 7% or so, 7% or 8%.\n\n---\n\nAgain, one follow-up question on the FX. Did I get it right that you're -- on the EBIT level you're hedged that you, basically, will see no absolute impact of potential FX gains? And that would be question one. Second question, talking to some of the German dealers on the tire side, it looks like that they currently have a huge inventory glut of winter tires. You -- how do you see that developing, basically, into Q4 this year? What kind of potential risk is there that we'll have a very, very bad winter tire business for Conti in Q4?\n\n---\n\nYes. First the FX understanding is not correct. We have said that the impact of FX on cost and sales is the same. So the -- relatively, margin will say the same, but the EBIT will change as well, influenced by the FX rate. The margin, not affected, but cost and sales are basically influenced the same, in the same relative way. And I'll confirm the winter tires at the dealers are high, quite high stocks. And I've mentioned already that, to our knowledge, the stocks -- and this is what we get as feedback from the dealers, the stocks of Continental are on a normal level, basically, not surprising, if you remember our reports of Q3, where we were reporting quite high winter tire sales into the organization, and now, I reported that the winter -- which were clearly above previous years' levels and now we reported that we've just managed to get full year numbers of 2013 matched in 2014, 22 million tires, meaning, we have reduced the selling into the tire organization quite significantly in Q4, which, in the end, leads to a reasonable stock situation at the dealers now, which, in the end, should not create a bigger problem for us than that for the 2015 sales, winter tire season starting in September or August, September in this year.\n\n---\n\nIt's Kristina Church here. Just coming back to Philip's question on your guidance for 2020. I was just wondering whether you're now giving such a medium-term guidance because you see any sort of change in the way that penetration rates will go towards 2020. Is it linked in any way to sort of European targets and whether you think there will be -- you'll be able to make this division, for instance, more acceleration and penetration rates as you get closer to 2020 targets? Or is it -- am I reading too much into that? And then another question on the Powertrain division and your targets to get to the 8%, x HEV. Could you just give a little bit of an update on the -- your growth progression that you're expecting to see in sales as well for the Powertrain division?\n\n---\n\nOn the 2020 medium-term sales target of more than EUR 50 billion, basically organic growth, which we were giving, I think, it should not be a surprise to any of those which are following closely our target outperformance of the market, 4% to 5%. Fair enough, for 2014 due to Powertrain was, a little below that number. But if you take that, you get to a number which is clearly above the EUR 50 billion in the next 5 years. So I think this should not be a surprise. And there is no change in any environmental factors or market factors, which made us -- make this statement. And the penetration rate -- additional penetration which we achieved in the cars is already there with advanced driver systems with more connectivity of the car, with connecting the cars with each other. So there is a lot to be expected and specific strong growth in '18, '19, '20. And I think this is a continuous process, as we have shown, fair enough, a little bit less in '14, but even in '14, which we have shown in the last year. Powertrain, the 8%, excluding the HEV business, is our target for 2015. Medium-term target is to achieve the 10%. But this will take then the next years until 2019 until we will achieve it.\n\n---\n\nTwo questions, as well. Coming back first to this midterm target that I find fascinating. Can I ask if you're assuming any down year between 2015 and 2020? Or whether you assume that it's going to be the first entire decade of economic increase since the beginning of the car industry between 1899 and 1912.\n\n---\n\nNo, we -- I mean, this is based on an expectation. We don't plan for a recession in these numbers. So this is planned for continuous growth of our -- of the car market, too, and it is above 100 million cars produced in 2020. This is the assumption on that.\n\n---\n\nOkay, so growth every year. Second one, coming back to winter tires and to the European replacement market overall. Can you say, if you start seeing any impact of lower oil price on miles driven, and we've seen that in the U.S, are you anticipating that we should see that in Europe as well? And can you, as well, talk about any effect you anticipate from the increased offer of either all-season tires and like what Jelly [ph], or what you offer, or these new type of tires that Michelin seems to want to introduce that would be a bit of a mixture between summer and winter, potentially accepted in the regulated markets?\n\n---\n\nWell, miles driven -- and what we do see -- as you rightly say, we do see this effect already in the U.S. Miles driven goes up. They, of course, do have less taxes in their gasoline price, I think below $2 now hardly being the price for a gallon, this has helped the Americans to drive more. In Europe, these numbers are not available. But we do by -- from past years, we do see some effect with such a drastic reduction of oil, which as well in Europe makes the gasoline price to go down to see some increase in miles driven. The connection of those 2 factors is not as strong as we see it in the U.S. We don't see at the moment, though there were some announcements, we don't see a bigger change in the structure in Europe between summer tires, winter tires and all-year-round tires.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Can I ask a question on the impact of raw material at a group level and you've discussed already what you anticipate for the Rubber Group. Can you explain us the equivalent effect on the Automotive Group on your primary raw material and the share of these raw materials, either indexed or not indexed? And what we should assume in terms of positive impact from raw materials in Automotive, please?\n\n---\n\nWell, first and second quarter, there was some tariffs for raw material, probably third quarter, probably something around the impact which we have seen in the fourth quarter. And our guidance then included some increase in the raw materials in the second half of the year, but I fully admit that our guidance for raw material in the last years were not always -- we were always guiding for some increase and up to now, it didn't come. We still believe that there should be some increase. To our knowledge, the natural rubber farmers are below all their production costs. And I mean we can, of course, lengthily discuss how the oil price will develop over the next half year. But I have mentioned the $10 down in the oil price, the effect on our cost reduction. The question there is so -- and I think this is the more important one, how much of this will finally stay with the tire producer and how much of this will be passed on to the consumers? Our assumption at the moment is no profit impact of raw materials in 2015 for Continental.\n\n---\n\nOkay. But did you reckon it might be conservative?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nCan I move to the ATV losses? I mean, if I'm correct, they've expanded -- increased in '14. I think you've said very openly that they would continue to be high in the coming years. Are they going to stay between EUR 100 million and EUR 150 million in '15, '16? Or can we expect that they should decline to be at double-digit million euros?\n\n---\n\nWell, they will clearly be above EUR 100 million in 2015. There will be some improvement then starting in '16, as we had shown in our third quarter conference, but it will take until 2019 before we get to a breakeven. And, basically, the 48-volt business which really is nicely getting into our books now, which will help to get the growth of this business unit.\n\n---\n\nOkay. The last one on the mining business and the impact it had on ContiTech and it had on Veyance. Can you tell us what you're assuming in terms of end market for '15, '16? And whether we should see already a recovery in the conveyor belt business and the construction business in '15, '16? Or whether you think it's still going to be a -- kind of flat in '15 before a potential recovery in '16?\n\n---\n\nTo a different degree we still expect the mining markets to be weak and potentially further decrease. Now for ContiTech. As conveyor belts are wear parts, you have to replace them because they're loose; these stones are running over them over time, they are worn out and they have to be replaced. So we do expect that this year, the replacement cycle is stronger kicking in for ContiTech, and by this that there should be some tailwind for the conveyor belt business. So it's not the mining market, it's more the intrinsic logic of the conveyor belt business.\n\n---\n\nFrank Biller, LBBW. A question on the order intake in the Automotive Group. So you've mentioned EUR 30 billion order intake lifetime volumes. Maybe you can give us more insight about what orders or which products are running best here in your new order intakes and, maybe, the comparable figure last year? The other question is on electric vehicle development. So we heard some news about electric vehicles not coming in so strong as expected. So what can you see right now? And what you expect in the quarters and years to come? And the other thing is in net debt, so gearing target is 20% here in your presentation here. So when do you want to reach this gearing of 20%? And what dividend policy should we expect until then?\n\n---\n\nThe order intake of Automotive -- I mean, I could -- I can give you some examples. We had a big order in Chassis & Safety of those numbers, which are stated there for the MK100 with Ford, which is the braking ESC system, the newest ESC system, with lifetime sales of more than half a billion. We had diverse advanced driver assistance systems with Toyota; I mentioned this as well. If you go to Powertrain diesel business with Koreans, exhaust business, the big exhaust business with BENTELER, transmission control with Ford and Audi as well, big orders, and I'm only mentioning orders which are on a very high level and an interior instrument cluster on the MQB platform, a hands-free module with some novel telematics with Toyota. So these are big orders which we have in our books.\n\n---\n\nThe comparable figure...\n\n---\n\nI'm sorry, next question on electric vehicles. Well, if you say not as strong as expected, this is always where you put your expectation on ours. Now I think we had already reduced our expectation quite significantly. And I would not confirm this now for us. We did not expect more on electric vehicle orders to be than we do see them at the moment. Nevertheless, as I've mentioned, we do see now the increase -- strong increase in the 48-volt hybrid solutions, which is for many carmakers, a very attractive solution they can use the -- without any reparation of these old motors and just add on the 48-volt solution. They don't have to construct a new motor, which already helps to get a significant reduction in the emissions. Net debt. Well, if you take our free cash flow guidance this year, deduct Veyance from it, it's basically a slight positive leftover and then take off the EUR 650 million dividend which we announced, we most probably end up this year with a somewhat higher indebtedness than we had seen it and a somewhat higher gearing ratio than we had seen it at the end of 2014. Nevertheless, with no further acquisitions assumed, if I take this assumption, I think we are in a good position to achieve the target of below 20% in 2016. Now this is not in any way confirming that we are not looking at potential M&A. This is just assuming theoretical pro forma calculation should be achieved in 2016, if we don't do any additional acquisition. Dividend policy unchanged, 15% to 30% payout ratio, with our actual performance, cash performance more in the upper end of this range, as we show the 27% payout ratio again in 2015 for '14.\n\n---\n\nMy first one is just on the Powertrain division. So at the Capital Markets Day there, you talked about diesel products being one of the weaknesses of that division. And I was just wondering if you could give us a percentage in terms of the Powertrain revenues that come from diesel products firstly?\n\n---\n\nAnd what's your third question?\n\n---\n\nI was just wondering in terms of the Powertrain division...\n\n---\n\nNo, this I understood. Okay, I thought there was another question to come. It's 1/3 basically of the engine system business which we have.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And my follow-up question to that was just in terms of some of the headlines we've seen in Europe about -- particularly in France, about this decentralization of diesel, would you consider a move away from that fuel within the European market a positive for the mix of Powertrain then?\n\n---\n\nWell, the diesel -- the injection pumps and the injection systems in diesel are the ones which have a higher value for us. I mean, you're talking about much higher pressure and more sophisticated technology. So a diesel system is clearly for us more attractive to sell in terms of sales volume than an injection system for gasoline cars. But the question is always asked, if there are less diesel cars or motors and more gasoline engines, what is the net effect on Continental? And then this is not so easy to say because the question is, what is the diesel engine going to be replaced with? If this is a gasoline engine, including turbo charges, including direct gasoline injection, potentially even including some hybrid systems, this might be the more attractive order of motor for us compared to diesel engine.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then my second question was just on the Rubber Group. So I think for 2014, from the numbers you've given, your adjusted price mix was neutral in the tires division. Price was negative within that, and the raw material tailwind was about EUR 190 million. So taking that together, does that mean that the net of price mix and raw material was a positive in 2014 for the Rubber Group and for tires, in particular?\n\n---\n\nYes, this is right. And you saw the increase in the margin of tires, which is confirming that. And just keep in mind, I mean, -- so yes, confirmed, but keep in mind that the price is 1:1 P&L relevant while mix is about only 30% P&L relevant.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And for 2015, you've given a suggestion of the pricing headwind as well. I'm assuming mix is, perhaps, positive on the opposite side of that, again, so potentially the net of price mix from raw material is, again, to be positive in '15? Is that a fair assumption?\n\n---\n\nNo, this I will not confirm. The price mix, again, price minus raw mix, we do see an increase of around 4 -- improvement of 4% in mix, so this I would confirm. But then again, back to what I said before, price 100% P&L relevant, mix only 30%. So there is a negative effect on the P&L. And as our expectation for the year is, basically, balance out, no effect, neither positive nor negative, from raw materials; the net balance of those 3 factors is negative.\n\n---\n\nJose, JPMorgan. On order intake, could you talk a bit about the timeline between orders and sales? And does it differ by division? And can we expect those sales to hit the order level the latest by '18? And second element, is it fair to assume the profitability of your Asian contracts is at least 2% higher than the average of the division? And could you share the share of the -- your Asian revenues across Chassis, Powertrain and Interiors? And I've got 2 follow-ups as well.\n\n---\n\nWell, order intake, normally 3 to 4 years until it materializes in our books; in some divisions, even longer. There are some orders which materialize already in the next year, but this is very few percentage of the order intake which we see. The profitability in Asia is basically in line with our profitability in the rest of the world. And the reason behind that is quite straightforward. Many of our customers in Asia, specifically in China, are those customers which we know from Europe and from the U.S. and from Japan. It is the international OEs and they, I mean, have their own purchasing department which makes sure they know our cost base in Europe, they know our cost base in the U.S. and in China, that we don't earn higher margins, which they would feel is unfair in those countries, than we do have them in Europe and the U.S. The Asia sales share is mentioned actually, I didn't comment on that. It's mentioned actually on the Page 17 of our presentation, for each division as well. Within the circle, you can see Chassis & Safety at 30%, sales share in Asia Powertrain 25%, Interior 22%. And in addition, our new Fact Book is available online at least now -- or in the afternoon. And there, you'll get the numbers, the newest numbers, not only for Asia, but for the sales pick-up of the divisions all over the world.\n\n---\n\nPerfect. And another 2, please. On Chassis & Safety, can you please comment what is the contribution from Honda on revenues and the -- on profits, please? And then on Interiors, how can you accelerate the order intake to make it sort of match the level of Chassis & Safety and Powertrain? Is it a question of product, of account management, I don't know, of competitors? Can you give us some insight there, please?\n\n---\n\nWell, Honda was EUR 500 million in 2014, expected to double until 2016 and breakeven, which was won in 2014. So I think we are on this path as expected, as this is a very, very high fixed cost business. And the second question, if I understood that right, could we accelerate the order intake in the Interior division? Well, 2 answers to that. On the one hand side, Interior includes all the aftermarket business of our Automotive divisions. And as you know, the aftermarket doesn't have this lifetime order intake. This is always, you sell to dealers. So this, on average, lowers the growth rate and the order intake shown in Interior relative to the sales of Interior. And secondly, I mean, this is depending as well on the orders -- big orders which might be on the market or are not on the market, and so this is why orders on the market might differ from one year to another, though it is already a big market. And by that, there are some natural changes from year-over-year just due to the fact what is available on the market and what is not available on the market.\n\n---\n\nPhilippe Barrier, Societe Generale. Two questions. Just the first question on the active safety. I would like to know when the Chassis & Safety division can go over the 10% operating margin, assuming that the active safety systems could really become profitable in the coming years? How many years to go about 10% for this division? And when should the active safety system get a decent level of margin? This is the first question. And second question is regarding the tire business. With integration of distribution network, it seems that the company is coming back to the -- its own distribution network. It could be a drag in term of profitability. Actually, does this distribution network could -- can negatively affect the operating margin in 2015? And what should be impact -- what should be the impact in terms of profitability for the tire business, assuming the margin now is 19%, actually hit a drag, which may prevent the division to go over the 20% operating margin again?\n\n---\n\nOur Chassis & Safety midterm target is 10%, and -- but I think what you are indirectly assuming, and your question is right, that the -- this is depending on the growth of the advanced driver assistance system businesses and orders which are in there and the future growth will help as it is a fixed cost business to get the margin up towards the 10%. The additional distribution channels are not in such a magnitude that they are having a big drag on the profitability margin of our tire division. And your assumption that we should go above 20% in 2015, and this is not possible because of additional distribution channels, is not correct.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just for a question on tires regarding LatAm operation. So you have a plant which was would it be recent [ph]. Today, what is your level of utilization of the plant in Brazil? And what should be the impact of declining market for Continental, specifically in Brazil?\n\n---\n\nWell, the utilization of our factories in Brazil is low. We are in a restructuring process. We've already had layoffs significantly in our white- and blue-collar people. We closed down by other reasons, so we closed down a factory in Manaus last year, and this process is not coming to an end at the moment, as we see as well and notice additional competition moving into the market. Sales, our sales share to Latin America is about 3% to 4% of our total sales. In that area, we are no longer profitable at the moment. This is why the restructuring is on its way. So it has some drag on the profitability of the overall of the Automotive business. But thanks to the fact that it is not such a big part, the effect is limited.\n\n---\n\nThank you very much. With this, then, we thank you for the very interesting Q&A session. If there are any follow-ups, as mentioned, please don't hesitate to contact the IR team; I am Rolf Woller. And talk to you next time, which will be on May 7, on the occasion of the release of the first quarter results. Thanks a lot.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Alexander Haissl (Analysts)】\nThis is Alex Haissl at Crédit Suisse. Three questions, if I may. First one on the costs side. I mean, we have seen quite significant increase in R&D costs in the Automotive business of 90 basis points, and also on the group level, SG&A costs up 40 basis points year-over-year. Can you help us out a little bit in terms of modeling what we can expect in particular for the R&D costs, given for Powertrain, these costs should come down, given the statements you made at the Capital Markets Day? My second question is also on the cost side or CapEx side. You indicate CapEx's percentages of sales still at 6%, given tire CapEx is slowing by almost 100 basis points year-over-year, and also Veyance is less capital intensive, if I take ContiTech as a proxy. So where is the incremental CapEx going? Is it the Auto business that we can expect higher CapEx figures for the Auto business here? And my last question is on the tire business. Can you give us an update on the Russia and the U.S. ramp-up? What we can expect year-over-year incremental volumes?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nOn the cost side, R&D up 90 basis points in Automotive. We expect that this level is the level which you can expect now for the year 2015. But please take into account there is a little bit already including structural changes in our business. Where the gross margin is increasing, we have less investments in hardware, structurally a little bit. And then by that, replaced by more software and R&D. So it's partly a structural change.\r\nThe sales costs are increasing, as I've mentioned, due to the fact that we have, via acquisition, included more distribution channels, controlled distribution, which will help to increase our market share in the next years. And this is a constant program. But I am, for this year, not foreseeing a bigger change in the additional of further sales channels, but if there would be a change or an opportunity for us, we will definitely have a close look at it. And if it's priced right and structurally okay, we might add that, and that could increase again the SG&A share of our cost. And on the cost side, you're right. CapEx, at the tires side, including ContiTech, can be a little bit weaker. But as soon as we have to invest further, and specifically in truck tire business, the number can go up again. And this is very much depending on the market development over the next time. Plus, we have seen strong order intake in Automotive. This can well -- as well have some effect on the investment quota now in Automotive for future business. So the about 6% number is a number which, I think, will materialize in 2015. Tires ramp-up in Russia and in the U.S., Kaluga and Sumter. We talked about the 1.3 million tires which we have produced in Kaluga in 2014, above 1 million -- a little bit more than 1 million in 2014 in Sumter. These numbers will move up in Sumter to 2.5 million in 2015 and in Kaluga to about 2 million. And Kaluga, specifically, is still mostly replacing imports, which up to now, we have done into the market from other Eastern European companies. And it might be that we do some export to Northern Europe from Kaluga, profiting from the poor export-accelerated exchange rate of Kaluga.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alexander Haissl (Analysts)】\nI've got just one quick follow-up question on the R&D spend what you mentioned for the Automotive business. When I look at the outperformance of the Automotive business versus the market, it's 200 to 300 basis points. It's clearly at the lower end of what you've indicated in the past, up to 500 basis points, largely due to the Powertrain business. So when can we expect Conti, basically, to move again up to the upper end in terms of outperformance versus the market? What's the compression? What's the visibility that you have coming from the order bookings?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nRight. So we should be back to the numbers which we have seen in years before in 2015. And specifically, as I can confirm that Powertrain is having a good start in the year and the 5% which we announced already in Regensburg at the third quarter conference is materializing. And this, as you rightly stated, was the drag on the growth in the Automotive area.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Philip Watkins (Analysts)】\nIt's Philip here from Citi. I was most interested in the 2020 revenue guidance. I was just wondering if you could, perhaps, elaborate on the assumptions there. I think -- I've read the press release, so it talks about a certain number of light vehicles. But are there any material acquisitions included in that beyond Veyance? And secondly, if I may, on FX. I think I've heard you say you're pretty much hedged in relation to year dollar moves at the EBIT line. Is that -- are you very confident that's going to be the case in 2015? And finally, actually just on pricing for each tire, I don't know if you've got a good feel for where replacement pricing might be in 2015.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nAnd the EUR 50 billion which we talked about this morning in the annual press conference is based on a car production of about 100 -- a little bit above 100 million cars. And it does not include -- I think there was some, probably, misunderstanding this morning, this does not include major M&A deals. Of course, it includes -- and this was the message we were giving, of course, this includes already Veyance because we know that we do have Veyance for these numbers. But it does not include -- it's not external growth. It is internal growth, which we expect based on our orders on book and our expected development. The euro-dollar profit hedge, not only euro-dollar, all our currency hedge which we have proven in the last 2 years, we do expect to hold as well for 2015. And again here, we have the first 2 months, and I reconfirm that. And then your third question, which was on...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Philip Watkins (Analysts)】\nYes, it was on replacement, and if you were feeling good on replacement.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nYes, pricing on tires. While we do see price pressure in Europe on tires, which is a little bit stronger than we had expected before, we do see quite low price pressure though in the U.S., which in the end leaves our expectation of a price down of about 4% in 2015.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Philip Watkins (Analysts)】\nIs the Chinese situation having an impact in Europe? The fact that Chinese tires have been less attractive in the U.S.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nThe Chinese import, it's too early to tell. We did not see the numbers for -- the final numbers for January, February, and the indications we have are not sufficient to answer that question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Horst Schneider (Analysts)】\nIt's Horst here from HSBC. A follow-up question on this translation effect that you calculate. I just want to ask if I got it right, so that you calculate the EUR 1 billion translation effect that you potentially see for '15 on the basis of the average U.S. dollar rate of the last 6 months, is that right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nWell, it is our -- this is not only U.S. dollar. We have about more than 20 currencies, and there is the effect of Eastern European currencies is important as well, as we have production sites there, and you know that sales are more in Euro from there or even in other currency. Overall, our expectation for this year is the EUR 1 billion and to remind you, last year, at the same time, we had said the expectation is EUR 700 million for 2014. We came out with EUR 460 million. I think -- so this was the forecast, which was quite okay. At the moment, I think the EUR 1 billion is a realistic number, of course, more of it to be seen in the first 3 quarters, and then the fourth quarter is where the currencies, the euro was already getting weaker and the currencies were already changing. That will be less than we expected then in Q4.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Horst Schneider (Analysts)】\nBut I mean, if I you take alone, for example, for the U.S. dollars, the average change over the last 6 months, you should assume a U.S. dollar-euro rate of USD 1.20. So we are now at USD 1.10. So that means -- what I want to know, if the currency rate stays where it is today at USD 1.10, USD 1.11, the translation effect potentially could be much bigger. I know it's not in your forecast. But if the currency -- if the euro remained as weak as it is, is that calculation right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nBut if you take again one single currency out of the set of our currencies...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Horst Schneider (Analysts)】\nBut it's the most important for you, right, the dollar?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nNo, no, it's not the -- the euro-dollar is not necessarily the most important. There is, as I've mentioned before, as well other Eastern European currencies, specifically on the hedge for the cost and sales side. So if the dollar would stay on this number, the number, the EUR 1 billion, might be a little bit higher. But, I mean, we do foresee and expect at the moment, the EUR 1 billion.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Horst Schneider (Analysts)】\nOkay. So in the last question -- or another question that I have is on European production. You only give this guidance including Russia, which drags down the European number in total. I want to know what you assume for the EU-28 countries in terms of production. Market gross?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nSchneider, I do have the Russia number which we assumed for 2015. I'm just looking in the table [ph], another minus 20% is included for the Russian production in these numbers. I don't have now Europe without Russia here in the numbers, but...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Horst Schneider (Analysts)】\nSo -- but would you agree that the start to the year, especially in Europe, has been stronger than you would have expected at end of last year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nWell, this is -- Schneider, this new car sales. There you're right. We do not see this in the production numbers. But, I mean, new car sales are a good indication that the car production should increase as well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Horst Schneider (Analysts)】\nAll right. And then the very last question that I have is, it was an interesting statement that you made on the order intake and that a big part of that came from Asia, and you also mentioned Toyota, and I also heard that from some smaller suppliers that, basically, I mean, it is said for some time now that Toyota is getting more open towards Western suppliers. Do you see significant upside from that perspective, especially with Japanese carmakers? Or is that a little bit too optimistic to state?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nNo, no, no, this is completely right. We do see quite some increase in our sales with Japanese OEs, so not our sales in Japan, but with Japanese OEs worldwide have a good chance to double over the next 4 to 5 years. And this is really an achievement which finally comes through; as you were rightly saying, they are more open to the Westerners.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Horst Schneider (Analysts)】\nWhere does the share stand right now? Just on an aggregate; you don't have to mention it for a specific carmaker.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nAnd the share of our automotive sales, yes, it's below 10% -- I mean, to all Japanese OEs, it's about 7% or so, 7% or 8%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christian Ludwig (Analysts)】\nAgain, one follow-up question on the FX. Did I get it right that you're -- on the EBIT level you're hedged that you, basically, will see no absolute impact of potential FX gains? And that would be question one. Second question, talking to some of the German dealers on the tire side, it looks like that they currently have a huge inventory glut of winter tires. You -- how do you see that developing, basically, into Q4 this year? What kind of potential risk is there that we'll have a very, very bad winter tire business for Conti in Q4?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nYes. First the FX understanding is not correct. We have said that the impact of FX on cost and sales is the same. So the -- relatively, margin will say the same, but the EBIT will change as well, influenced by the FX rate. The margin, not affected, but cost and sales are basically influenced the same, in the same relative way. And I'll confirm the winter tires at the dealers are high, quite high stocks. And I've mentioned already that, to our knowledge, the stocks -- and this is what we get as feedback from the dealers, the stocks of Continental are on a normal level, basically, not surprising, if you remember our reports of Q3, where we were reporting quite high winter tire sales into the organization, and now, I reported that the winter -- which were clearly above previous years' levels and now we reported that we've just managed to get full year numbers of 2013 matched in 2014, 22 million tires, meaning, we have reduced the selling into the tire organization quite significantly in Q4, which, in the end, leads to a reasonable stock situation at the dealers now, which, in the end, should not create a bigger problem for us than that for the 2015 sales, winter tire season starting in September or August, September in this year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Kristina Church (Analysts)】\nIt's Kristina Church here. Just coming back to Philip's question on your guidance for 2020. I was just wondering whether you're now giving such a medium-term guidance because you see any sort of change in the way that penetration rates will go towards 2020. Is it linked in any way to sort of European targets and whether you think there will be -- you'll be able to make this division, for instance, more acceleration and penetration rates as you get closer to 2020 targets? Or is it -- am I reading too much into that? And then another question on the Powertrain division and your targets to get to the 8%, x HEV. Could you just give a little bit of an update on the -- your growth progression that you're expecting to see in sales as well for the Powertrain division?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nOn the 2020 medium-term sales target of more than EUR 50 billion, basically organic growth, which we were giving, I think, it should not be a surprise to any of those which are following closely our target outperformance of the market, 4% to 5%. Fair enough, for 2014 due to Powertrain was, a little below that number. But if you take that, you get to a number which is clearly above the EUR 50 billion in the next 5 years. So I think this should not be a surprise. And there is no change in any environmental factors or market factors, which made us -- make this statement. And the penetration rate -- additional penetration which we achieved in the cars is already there with advanced driver systems with more connectivity of the car, with connecting the cars with each other. So there is a lot to be expected and specific strong growth in '18, '19, '20. And I think this is a continuous process, as we have shown, fair enough, a little bit less in '14, but even in '14, which we have shown in the last year. Powertrain, the 8%, excluding the HEV business, is our target for 2015. Medium-term target is to achieve the 10%. But this will take then the next years until 2019 until we will achieve it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Besson (Analysts)】\nTwo questions, as well. Coming back first to this midterm target that I find fascinating. Can I ask if you're assuming any down year between 2015 and 2020? Or whether you assume that it's going to be the first entire decade of economic increase since the beginning of the car industry between 1899 and 1912.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nNo, we -- I mean, this is based on an expectation. We don't plan for a recession in these numbers. So this is planned for continuous growth of our -- of the car market, too, and it is above 100 million cars produced in 2020. This is the assumption on that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Besson (Analysts)】\nOkay, so growth every year. Second one, coming back to winter tires and to the European replacement market overall. Can you say, if you start seeing any impact of lower oil price on miles driven, and we've seen that in the U.S, are you anticipating that we should see that in Europe as well? And can you, as well, talk about any effect you anticipate from the increased offer of either all-season tires and like what Jelly [ph], or what you offer, or these new type of tires that Michelin seems to want to introduce that would be a bit of a mixture between summer and winter, potentially accepted in the regulated markets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nWell, miles driven -- and what we do see -- as you rightly say, we do see this effect already in the U.S. Miles driven goes up. They, of course, do have less taxes in their gasoline price, I think below $2 now hardly being the price for a gallon, this has helped the Americans to drive more. In Europe, these numbers are not available. But we do by -- from past years, we do see some effect with such a drastic reduction of oil, which as well in Europe makes the gasoline price to go down to see some increase in miles driven. The connection of those 2 factors is not as strong as we see it in the U.S. We don't see at the moment, though there were some announcements, we don't see a bigger change in the structure in Europe between summer tires, winter tires and all-year-round tires.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Besson (Analysts)】\nOkay. Can I ask a question on the impact of raw material at a group level and you've discussed already what you anticipate for the Rubber Group. Can you explain us the equivalent effect on the Automotive Group on your primary raw material and the share of these raw materials, either indexed or not indexed? And what we should assume in terms of positive impact from raw materials in Automotive, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nWell, first and second quarter, there was some tariffs for raw material, probably third quarter, probably something around the impact which we have seen in the fourth quarter. And our guidance then included some increase in the raw materials in the second half of the year, but I fully admit that our guidance for raw material in the last years were not always -- we were always guiding for some increase and up to now, it didn't come. We still believe that there should be some increase. To our knowledge, the natural rubber farmers are below all their production costs. And I mean we can, of course, lengthily discuss how the oil price will develop over the next half year. But I have mentioned the $10 down in the oil price, the effect on our cost reduction. The question there is so -- and I think this is the more important one, how much of this will finally stay with the tire producer and how much of this will be passed on to the consumers? Our assumption at the moment is no profit impact of raw materials in 2015 for Continental.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Besson (Analysts)】\nOkay. But did you reckon it might be conservative?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Besson (Analysts)】\nCan I move to the ATV losses? I mean, if I'm correct, they've expanded -- increased in '14. I think you've said very openly that they would continue to be high in the coming years. Are they going to stay between EUR 100 million and EUR 150 million in '15, '16? Or can we expect that they should decline to be at double-digit million euros?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nWell, they will clearly be above EUR 100 million in 2015. There will be some improvement then starting in '16, as we had shown in our third quarter conference, but it will take until 2019 before we get to a breakeven. And, basically, the 48-volt business which really is nicely getting into our books now, which will help to get the growth of this business unit.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Thomas Besson (Analysts)】\nOkay. The last one on the mining business and the impact it had on ContiTech and it had on Veyance. Can you tell us what you're assuming in terms of end market for '15, '16? And whether we should see already a recovery in the conveyor belt business and the construction business in '15, '16? Or whether you think it's still going to be a -- kind of flat in '15 before a potential recovery in '16?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nTo a different degree we still expect the mining markets to be weak and potentially further decrease. Now for ContiTech. As conveyor belts are wear parts, you have to replace them because they're loose; these stones are running over them over time, they are worn out and they have to be replaced. So we do expect that this year, the replacement cycle is stronger kicking in for ContiTech, and by this that there should be some tailwind for the conveyor belt business. So it's not the mining market, it's more the intrinsic logic of the conveyor belt business.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Frank Biller (Analysts)】\nFrank Biller, LBBW. A question on the order intake in the Automotive Group. So you've mentioned EUR 30 billion order intake lifetime volumes. Maybe you can give us more insight about what orders or which products are running best here in your new order intakes and, maybe, the comparable figure last year? The other question is on electric vehicle development. So we heard some news about electric vehicles not coming in so strong as expected. So what can you see right now? And what you expect in the quarters and years to come? And the other thing is in net debt, so gearing target is 20% here in your presentation here. So when do you want to reach this gearing of 20%? And what dividend policy should we expect until then?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nThe order intake of Automotive -- I mean, I could -- I can give you some examples. We had a big order in Chassis & Safety of those numbers, which are stated there for the MK100 with Ford, which is the braking ESC system, the newest ESC system, with lifetime sales of more than half a billion. We had diverse advanced driver assistance systems with Toyota; I mentioned this as well. If you go to Powertrain diesel business with Koreans, exhaust business, the big exhaust business with BENTELER, transmission control with Ford and Audi as well, big orders, and I'm only mentioning orders which are on a very high level and an interior instrument cluster on the MQB platform, a hands-free module with some novel telematics with Toyota. So these are big orders which we have in our books.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Frank Biller (Analysts)】\nThe comparable figure...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nI'm sorry, next question on electric vehicles. Well, if you say not as strong as expected, this is always where you put your expectation on ours. Now I think we had already reduced our expectation quite significantly. And I would not confirm this now for us. We did not expect more on electric vehicle orders to be than we do see them at the moment. Nevertheless, as I've mentioned, we do see now the increase -- strong increase in the 48-volt hybrid solutions, which is for many carmakers, a very attractive solution they can use the -- without any reparation of these old motors and just add on the 48-volt solution. They don't have to construct a new motor, which already helps to get a significant reduction in the emissions. Net debt. Well, if you take our free cash flow guidance this year, deduct Veyance from it, it's basically a slight positive leftover and then take off the EUR 650 million dividend which we announced, we most probably end up this year with a somewhat higher indebtedness than we had seen it and a somewhat higher gearing ratio than we had seen it at the end of 2014. Nevertheless, with no further acquisitions assumed, if I take this assumption, I think we are in a good position to achieve the target of below 20% in 2016. Now this is not in any way confirming that we are not looking at potential M&A. This is just assuming theoretical pro forma calculation should be achieved in 2016, if we don't do any additional acquisition. Dividend policy unchanged, 15% to 30% payout ratio, with our actual performance, cash performance more in the upper end of this range, as we show the 27% payout ratio again in 2015 for '14.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Hartley (Analysts)】\nMy first one is just on the Powertrain division. So at the Capital Markets Day there, you talked about diesel products being one of the weaknesses of that division. And I was just wondering if you could give us a percentage in terms of the Powertrain revenues that come from diesel products firstly?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nAnd what's your third question?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Hartley (Analysts)】\nI was just wondering in terms of the Powertrain division...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nNo, this I understood. Okay, I thought there was another question to come. It's 1/3 basically of the engine system business which we have.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Hartley (Analysts)】\nOkay. And my follow-up question to that was just in terms of some of the headlines we've seen in Europe about -- particularly in France, about this decentralization of diesel, would you consider a move away from that fuel within the European market a positive for the mix of Powertrain then?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nWell, the diesel -- the injection pumps and the injection systems in diesel are the ones which have a higher value for us. I mean, you're talking about much higher pressure and more sophisticated technology. So a diesel system is clearly for us more attractive to sell in terms of sales volume than an injection system for gasoline cars. But the question is always asked, if there are less diesel cars or motors and more gasoline engines, what is the net effect on Continental? And then this is not so easy to say because the question is, what is the diesel engine going to be replaced with? If this is a gasoline engine, including turbo charges, including direct gasoline injection, potentially even including some hybrid systems, this might be the more attractive order of motor for us compared to diesel engine.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Hartley (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then my second question was just on the Rubber Group. So I think for 2014, from the numbers you've given, your adjusted price mix was neutral in the tires division. Price was negative within that, and the raw material tailwind was about EUR 190 million. So taking that together, does that mean that the net of price mix and raw material was a positive in 2014 for the Rubber Group and for tires, in particular?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nYes, this is right. And you saw the increase in the margin of tires, which is confirming that. And just keep in mind, I mean, -- so yes, confirmed, but keep in mind that the price is 1:1 P&L relevant while mix is about only 30% P&L relevant.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Hartley (Analysts)】\nOkay. And for 2015, you've given a suggestion of the pricing headwind as well. I'm assuming mix is, perhaps, positive on the opposite side of that, again, so potentially the net of price mix from raw material is, again, to be positive in '15? Is that a fair assumption?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nNo, this I will not confirm. The price mix, again, price minus raw mix, we do see an increase of around 4 -- improvement of 4% in mix, so this I would confirm. But then again, back to what I said before, price 100% P&L relevant, mix only 30%. So there is a negative effect on the P&L. And as our expectation for the year is, basically, balance out, no effect, neither positive nor negative, from raw materials; the net balance of those 3 factors is negative.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jose Asumendi (Analysts)】\nJose, JPMorgan. On order intake, could you talk a bit about the timeline between orders and sales? And does it differ by division? And can we expect those sales to hit the order level the latest by '18? And second element, is it fair to assume the profitability of your Asian contracts is at least 2% higher than the average of the division? And could you share the share of the -- your Asian revenues across Chassis, Powertrain and Interiors? And I've got 2 follow-ups as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nWell, order intake, normally 3 to 4 years until it materializes in our books; in some divisions, even longer. There are some orders which materialize already in the next year, but this is very few percentage of the order intake which we see. The profitability in Asia is basically in line with our profitability in the rest of the world. And the reason behind that is quite straightforward. Many of our customers in Asia, specifically in China, are those customers which we know from Europe and from the U.S. and from Japan. It is the international OEs and they, I mean, have their own purchasing department which makes sure they know our cost base in Europe, they know our cost base in the U.S. and in China, that we don't earn higher margins, which they would feel is unfair in those countries, than we do have them in Europe and the U.S. The Asia sales share is mentioned actually, I didn't comment on that. It's mentioned actually on the Page 17 of our presentation, for each division as well. Within the circle, you can see Chassis & Safety at 30%, sales share in Asia Powertrain 25%, Interior 22%. And in addition, our new Fact Book is available online at least now -- or in the afternoon. And there, you'll get the numbers, the newest numbers, not only for Asia, but for the sales pick-up of the divisions all over the world.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jose Asumendi (Analysts)】\nPerfect. And another 2, please. On Chassis & Safety, can you please comment what is the contribution from Honda on revenues and the -- on profits, please? And then on Interiors, how can you accelerate the order intake to make it sort of match the level of Chassis & Safety and Powertrain? Is it a question of product, of account management, I don't know, of competitors? Can you give us some insight there, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nWell, Honda was EUR 500 million in 2014, expected to double until 2016 and breakeven, which was won in 2014. So I think we are on this path as expected, as this is a very, very high fixed cost business. And the second question, if I understood that right, could we accelerate the order intake in the Interior division? Well, 2 answers to that. On the one hand side, Interior includes all the aftermarket business of our Automotive divisions. And as you know, the aftermarket doesn't have this lifetime order intake. This is always, you sell to dealers. So this, on average, lowers the growth rate and the order intake shown in Interior relative to the sales of Interior. And secondly, I mean, this is depending as well on the orders -- big orders which might be on the market or are not on the market, and so this is why orders on the market might differ from one year to another, though it is already a big market. And by that, there are some natural changes from year-over-year just due to the fact what is available on the market and what is not available on the market.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Philippe Barrier (Analysts)】\nPhilippe Barrier, Societe Generale. Two questions. Just the first question on the active safety. I would like to know when the Chassis & Safety division can go over the 10% operating margin, assuming that the active safety systems could really become profitable in the coming years? How many years to go about 10% for this division? And when should the active safety system get a decent level of margin? This is the first question. And second question is regarding the tire business. With integration of distribution network, it seems that the company is coming back to the -- its own distribution network. It could be a drag in term of profitability. Actually, does this distribution network could -- can negatively affect the operating margin in 2015? And what should be impact -- what should be the impact in terms of profitability for the tire business, assuming the margin now is 19%, actually hit a drag, which may prevent the division to go over the 20% operating margin again?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nOur Chassis & Safety midterm target is 10%, and -- but I think what you are indirectly assuming, and your question is right, that the -- this is depending on the growth of the advanced driver assistance system businesses and orders which are in there and the future growth will help as it is a fixed cost business to get the margin up towards the 10%. The additional distribution channels are not in such a magnitude that they are having a big drag on the profitability margin of our tire division. And your assumption that we should go above 20% in 2015, and this is not possible because of additional distribution channels, is not correct.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Philippe Barrier (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just for a question on tires regarding LatAm operation. So you have a plant which was would it be recent [ph]. Today, what is your level of utilization of the plant in Brazil? And what should be the impact of declining market for Continental, specifically in Brazil?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Wolfgang Schafer (Executives)】\nWell, the utilization of our factories in Brazil is low. We are in a restructuring process. We've already had layoffs significantly in our white- and blue-collar people. We closed down by other reasons, so we closed down a factory in Manaus last year, and this process is not coming to an end at the moment, as we see as well and notice additional competition moving into the market. Sales, our sales share to Latin America is about 3% to 4% of our total sales. In that area, we are no longer profitable at the moment. This is why the restructuring is on its way. So it has some drag on the profitability of the overall of the Automotive business. But thanks to the fact that it is not such a big part, the effect is limited.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Rolf Woller (Executives)】\nThank you very much. With this, then, we thank you for the very interesting Q&A session. If there are any follow-ups, as mentioned, please don't hesitate to contact the IR team; I am Rolf Woller. And talk to you next time, which will be on May 7, on the occasion of the release of the first quarter results. Thanks a lot.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, and good afternoon or good morning, wherever you are to the investor conference call on the full year 2014 results of Deutsche Post DHL group. I take it you have got the material that you could download or find on the app in front of you. And we have, as announced, the group's CEO, Frank Appel, with us as well as the group's CFO, Larry Rosen. I will hand over to them for the presentations. Afterwards, as usual, sufficient time for Q&A. And with that, I'd like to hand over to you, Frank.\n\n---\n\nHello from our side as well, and thank you for joining us today on our 2014 numbers. Let me go straight away into the summary, which is on Page 3 of the document. I think that summarized quite well where we ended up in 2014. We -- I think 2014 was a preparation year and a good step in the right direction. Express actually has performed pretty well with them EBIT -- 10% EBIT margins, which we had for years, achieved 1 year early than originally planned. I think that's great. You see also strong growth in the PeP division for parcels and a very moderate decline, which is actually less than what we originally guided years ago with 2% to 3% decline and it was again -- it was better in mail. We have our challenges with our cost position, particularly with the salary level. You might have followed that we have done something. I'll come to that later on as well but that has, of course, had impact on our EBIT numbers here as well. The transformation in DGF with the NFE program is a key priority and will remain a key priority. In summary, here, it appears to be more challenging when we expect it, but I believe we are taking the right actions to get it back on track. \r\nSupply Chain. We are pretty pleased with the new strategy where we guided you that we will make mid-term 4% to 5% margins. We improved it. John Gilbert and his team have taken first actions. You can see that in the numbers. We had good growth and even more growth on the bottom line. So therefore, we believe that our story is still intact. We have a very strong portfolio of divisions. We are well exposed to the major trends, emerging markets in eCommerce. We have, as I'll explain later, a very clear roadmap to improve the profitability with clear goals. And I think we showed another year where we improved the cash flow. And you definitely have some questions with regard to 2013 and '14 cash flow, and Larry will comment on that later. \r\nSo overall, we will give you today a guidance -- more concrete guidance for this year. We said last summer, as you remember, significantly improvement, and I think our guidance confirms that today. We reconfirmed our targets for 2016 and '20. \r\nSo one thing I would like to mention, it's not important, it doesn't cost too much money because it's a tiny change, but important, we want to now call the company not Deutsche Post DHL but Deutsche Post DHL Group because it makes clear, particularly in countries where we still use different brands, that they belong to the group. So that's the purpose of that. \r\nSo on the next page, you see the high-level annual numbers for the group. We had good growth for the group of 3% organically, actually 4%, though currency was still to our disadvantage last year on the top line. Overall, all divisions grew, Express the most, and the others followed. \r\nOn the bottom line, on the EBIT, you can see as well, we had a good year where we ended up in our range, as guided. We have slight improvement in PeP, but the trend is still the same. That's the reason why we are now in challenging discussions with our unions. We have the same -- the growth on the top line is bigger than on the bottom line. Express has developed very well. We had another year with double-digit bottom line growth based on market share gains. [indiscernible] has been challenged, and that continued in the fourth quarter. We have learned a lot from the pilots, but as I said, the change of structure processes and system is quite a stretch for the organization and definitely has taken away management attention from the day-to-day, therefore, you see as well, here, impact from the day-to-day business, and that's the reason why we decided that we had some growth on the top line, we have seen a significant decline on the bottom line. Of course, we are not satisfied with that, but it's sometimes difficult. If you want to transform a business model, you have to bite the bullet once in a while and -- but we are confident that we can change that trend in the coming times. \r\nSo Supply Chain, nice growth on the top line. If you forget the one-time things in the fourth quarter last year, we probably would be more around 10% EBIT development. I think that's a good result of making the organization leaner, more focused and more standardized. \r\nSo overall, we are pleased to -- that we delivered, as promised, again, and we had another nice uplift. It's a year -- 2015 will be a year of transition from the old strategy to the new strategy. As I said, I think that is necessary to really go then furthermore aspiration that goes until 2020. \r\nPage 5 summarizes briefly the trend for volumes. We're always [ph] at 3 -- 2% to 3% decline. We ended up somewhere between 1% and 2% overall, which is slightly less than expected. It's much better than many other post operators perform. We believe that's a consequence of great quality for a decent price. \r\nParcel volumes remain strong. Fourth quarter was very strong, actually, which is good news, of course. The trend is in good shape and we see really nice development. I will explain later on that we have started to expand our business beyond Germany. This is first good results and also the E-Post team has delivered for the first time more than EUR 300 million. \r\nWe have a challenge with the wage situation we have in PeP. We are tackling that at the moment by creating new subsidiaries with lower salaries, which are still fair and attractive but significantly lower than what we have currently. That will definitely lead to some dispute with the union, but as always, we -- I believe we will find a way sooner or later to get that sorted out, too. \r\nPage 6 is Express. Very consistent, very nice development on both revenue per day and shipments per day, and as I said, another very good year of margin improvement and 1 year ahead of the original plan. I think that's a great result. And we have no doubt 2014 was another year where we gain, on a global scale, market share. \r\nGlobal Forwarding Freight. We have seen growth again, which is good, not only in Air Freight but also in Ocean Freight. But I repeat myself to a certain extent, it is a challenge. It takes management attention this way, it is probably also more complex than the we originally planned. But we believe that what we have seen, the pilots with the approach we are taking will work, probably preparation, some challenges with complexity probably have to be adapted, and then we are ready to go for the next step. But it's at the moment challenging and you see that in our numbers. So as I said, we are not happy about that. But once in a while, you have to bite the bullet and have to go through these things. And the measures we have taken over the last months, that [indiscernible] and his team have taken, should help us to get back on track. \r\nSupply Chain. Group performance continued. The EUR 1.2 billion in new signings is almost half of the next total revenue -- of the total revenue of the next competitor some more [ph], so we had gained again a lot of business with the focus on certain sectors. The focus on standardization and making the organization leaner is paying off, and you can see that more even in the bottom line than in the top line. \r\nSo the strategic priorities, I'm switching to Page 10. There's nothing new. We launched our strategy Focus.Connect.Grow for 2020 last April. You can see here that we still believe and are confident that we will benefit from eCommerce and the emerging markets. We have a very good portfolio exposed to these trends in particular. We have clear [indiscernible], as I explain again and remind you for all divisions to improve the profitability and our balance sheet becomes more and more flexible, having again another year where we generated more free cash flow than the dividend. \r\nSo on Page 11. Just an example from the eCommerce world. We have done already a lot in Europe. We have started recently in Slovakia for domestic B2C parcels. We have -- on the bottom left, you see that we have expanded our drop points already for consumers. We believe that this is a key differentiator in end markets for how easy you have access to the network. We have done that already and tripled the volumes almost, and we started as well a more comprehensive service in one of the countries, or 2 countries, like the Netherlands and Belgium, and on the other side, we introduced our portal we operate in Germany for a while already through Poland, and this is all up and running. So the team in Europe is doing great. They are making great progress, of course. It's all relatively small in comparison to the scale of the company. But the E-Post journey started slow as well, and now we have EUR 300 million revenue. So I think we will see similar things here in the eCommerce arena as well. \r\nOn Page 12, you can see and quite heavy above that, that for the first time since many years, all our divisions have grown faster their volume, or in Supply Chain's case, the revenue, faster than the underlying GDP growth was, which is good sign because obviously, we are in markets where you can grow and our market position is such that we can grow faster than the worldwide GDP. As -- that was our aspiration in our Strategy 2020. \r\nOn Page 13, you see a summary of the different journeys we went through so far and want to continue. The PeP -- the expansion of eCommerce and Parcels is clear. The optimization of all cost position, Germany is clear. That all should lead to a 3% EBIT CAGR until 2020, and we believe that this is achievable. In Express, the focus on TDI will continue. We will remain very much focused on service quality. That's the reason why we are investing into the hubs and gateways significantly in all of our fleet, because we believe that this is a competitive advantage. We put that all into our plan, and now, we will talk about our CapEx guidance later, but we are very confident that we can stay ahead of a game by really upgrading our service quality continuously. \r\nDGFF, the new Forwarding environment is important and is right and is challenging. Those of you who are following our competitors in the industry know that we are not the only one who have some challenges. It is a difficult journey for such a trading business, but we believe that we have found the right approach. We still have to optimize the approach, but still, we believe that the way going forward is right and we will continue to do so to really close the gap of EBIT performance to competitors. \r\nSupply Chain. The new standardization overhead leverage and portfolio management should give us better margins. John Gilbert in a tutorial recently gave you a commitment as well that we can make it 4% to 5%. After what I have seen for the first year, I'm very confident that this is still good. There is tremendous momentum in his organization, and I'm very happy about the progress we have seen already in the first 12 months. \r\nPage 14 shows you as well, going back a little bit, what's been our aspirations. Yes, we wanted to stabilize the EBIT and PeP about EUR 1 billion and 2 years in a row significantly ahead of that and even never even were close to this EUR 1 billion. So 5 years ago, probably everybody thought this is a nice aspiration, but how should that happen, and I remember some of the discussions we had with some of you even way, who said, this is America. How are you going to make it happen? I think we have demonstrated that we are capable to turn this division around from shrinking into a growth engine for the company. \r\nOn the right side, you see the margins for the DHL divisions. We have progressed in 2 divisions pretty well. And DGF, which has been the strongest-performing division, not by margin but absolute terms for a long, long period is challenged at the moment. And as I said, I and we feel confident that we can return to levels which we had or even better in due course, but it is a challenge to do that. \r\nSo then finally, from my side, on the dividend, we are happy that we can propose the AGM another increase of our dividend by EUR 0.05 to EUR 0.85. It's a good history now. We're having increase in dividends in the last 5 years continuously. We are in the middle of our range, as promised. We have a clear finance policy, which is unchanged and we will continue of course to look into free cash flow and the usage of free cash flow the same way as we have done before. \r\nSo that's from my side. So overall, a solid year. We have delivered as we have guided. We believe that we have started the journey to create the right platform for 2020. 2015, really a year of solid transformation and preparation. I usually call that internally. We are now moving from the first S curve to the next, and that is linked to some challenges in the numbers, short term. I mean, that we have expenses we have to digest, but we feel that this necessary to really go then to the next S curve and deliver our aspiration until 2020.\r\nSo thank you very much for listening. With that, I hand over to Larry.\n\n---\n\nThank you, and good afternoon to everybody. I'm pleased to continue the presentation now and take a deeper look at our financial performance for the full year 2014 and also Q4 that will include a review of each division, and then I'll finish up with a review of our guidance for 2015 and '16. \r\nSo onto Page 17. We see the group P&L for the full year 2014. The revenue increased by over 3% on a reported basis and organically, group revenues rose 4.2% in the year, supported by especially steady volume and revenue gains in the international express and German parcel businesses. \r\nOperating profit grew by 3.5% or around EUR 100 million to EUR 2.965 billion and was in the targeted range of EUR 2.9 billion to EUR 3.1 billion. The financial result declined mainly due to positive one-off benefits from the first half of 2013. \r\nThe tax rate increased to 15.5%, consistent with our guidance of around 16%, but expenses were higher as the rate was a bit higher than we had last year. And due to those developments in financial and tax expenses, net profit declined very slightly to EUR 2.07 billion. \r\nOn Page 18, we see the group P&L for Q4. Revenues in the final quarter showed strong growth with 6.3% as we finally got some currency tailwind. Organic revenue growth was similar to the full year with 4.1%. EBIT increased by around 2% to EUR 905 million. Excluding the EUR 30 million positive one-off that we had last year in the Supply Chain business in Q4, EBIT growth would have been around 5.5%. \r\nPeP division contributed with a strong gain of 13.6%, reflecting Parcel volume growth following a very strong seasonal pattern around Christmas time in the eCommerce business. The good PeP results were partially offset by an EBIT decline in the DHL divisions, and this was mainly due to the transformation program, NFE, in our Global Forwarding business and a large positive one-off that I already mentioned in the Supply Chain business in Q4 last year. \r\nExpress, again, had strong TDI volume growth across all regions with an increase of almost 12% in the EBIT. Consolidated net profit declined by 17% to EUR 640 million, again, as a result of higher interest expense and a higher tax rate. \r\nIn Q4 of 2013, we had a tax income reflecting the adjustment we made in that quarter to bring the full year rate down to 14%. \r\nPage 19, we see our cash flow performance for Q4. Overall operating cash flow was again very strong, with over EUR 1 billion of operating cash flow and even slightly exceeded what was last year already a very strong performance in Q4. And we had, again, a year-end decline in working capital, supporting altogether the very good operating cash flow performance of EUR 1.66 billion. \r\nAnd a higher CapEx spend in Q4 brought the full year level of free cash flow generation then in line with the strong 2014 level. As last year, part of the CapEx will be cashed out in the current year, though likely not as much as we had at the beginning of 2014 as a spillover from 2013. \r\nOverall free cash flow for the year was over EUR 1.3 billion, comfortably exceeding our forecast of surpassing or exceeding the dividend we paid last May of around EUR 1 billion. \r\nOn Page 20, keeping on the cash flow subject, we're especially pleased about the progress of cash flow generation over the last several years. After several years, many years, of below-average performance and very significant cash outflows for restructuring, we have, in the last 2 years been able to comfortably cover the substantial dividend that we pay in May of each year. And this is due, of course, to our improved operating performance, the very good working capital management and, of course, the significant reduction in outflows for restructuring. \r\nAnd we've been able to do this even with higher CapEx investments, reflecting our investments into growth and in our strategy with the biggest investments coming in Express and in the Parcel business. \r\nCash flow is really important to us. It's embedded in all of our management incentive systems. It has become a key part of our daily decision-making and also strategic deliberation. \r\nOn Page 21, you see our net debt evolution for the year 2014, and we're pleased that with the very strong performance in Q4, we could bring the total debt level exactly in line with the end of 2013 despite having spent more on CapEx and having paid a higher dividend this year than we did the previous year. We expect to, again, follow our seasonal pattern in 2015 so that our net debt should increase during the first half of the year and then improve considerably during the second half. \r\nOn Page 22, a deep dive or a medium dive into the subject of pensions. And it's an important subject because there's been such change in the liabilities and results associated with pensions, but also because of the still recent accounting change. And under the new standard, IAS 19R, our pension liability or defined benefit obligation increases when interest rates, or more precisely, the discount rate for pensions declines. Over the year 2014, this led the pension liability, the gross pension liability, to grow by more than EUR 3 billion, but thanks to very strong performance of our pension assets, the net provision went up by a little more than EUR 2 billion to EUR 7.1 billion by year end. \r\nIn Q4, despite another decrease in the discount rate, our net pension provision was even slightly down just considering the quarter.\r\nThinking about the future, on the P&L we would expect a slight increase in personnel costs in the low double-digit range and, of course, no change in cash flow generation. \r\nSo Page 23. We'll start to look at the individual division performance for Q4, and we'll start with PeP. So revenues climbed by 4.1% to EUR 4.35 billion in Q4. It was our strongest growth quarter for the year and reflected especially the continued growth in parcel volumes along with small price increases that came at the beginning and some at the middle of the year and overall, more than offset the letter volume decline that we saw in Q4. \r\nEBIT performance was very good, with a high contribution from eCommerce and Parcel, including a very strong year-end seasonal impact and good cost control.\r\nOperating cash flow increased by over 30%, driven by improved working capital development and also, of course, the increased EBIT. CapEx declined but it purely reflects phasing effects in our overall higher investments in Parcel infrastructure expansion. \r\nPage 24. I want to focus here on an interesting development in PeP reporting. And over the last 2 years, we have reduced our provision for purchase, but not yet used stamps by EUR 50 million each year. Last year, we categorized the provision release as a nonrecurring or extraordinary event. But as we've observed consumer behavior again this year, we see the development more as a normal part of our business. \r\nFollowing 15 years of price stability in Germany, we now have increased the stamp price slightly in each of the last 3 years. As a result, as soon as we announced the increase in the fall, when it's approved by the regulator, we observed that consumers draw down their stock of stamps with the old price and buy fewer new stamps. We think that with the current practice of regular price increases, overall inventory levels are reduced on average and this is then reflected in the provision movement. \r\nOverall, the change in provision is roughly in line with the lower stamp sales, so that their combined effect on revenue and EBIT is about neutral. \r\nSo Page 25. Express revenues and EBIT continue to reflect the strong trends from the previous quarters, where we continue to grow faster than the market and have seen a very positive development in EBIT growth and margins. The division's revenue rose by around 10%, reflecting continued strong TDI volume growth across all regions. Adjusted for exchange rate effects, revenue increased by about 6.6%. \r\nEBIT increased by almost 12%, reflecting higher volumes combined with continued good cost management and higher efficiency in the aviation and ground networks. The 2014 EBIT margin climbed to 10 -- for the full year, climbed to 10.1% and with this, already exceeded the projected 10% margin that we originally targeted for 2015. \r\nCapEx increased year-over-year as we spent more on upgrading and improving our global and regional hubs in Leipzig, Brussels, Cincinnati, Singapore and Dubai. And the investments also included expanding and renewing our air fleet, upgrading customer service and investing in other quality measures. \r\nPage 26. We look at Global Forwarding and Freight. And it's pretty much a continuation of the developments we've seen in previous quarters. In a still-challenging industry environment, DGFF, Global Forwarding and Freight, achieved a revenue increase of almost 5%, and it's been driven by volume recovery in Air and Ocean Freight as well as some minor foreign exchange effects. But division operating profit fell by 48.6%, as continued low gross profit margins were coupled with high direct and indirect costs associated with implementation of our transformation program, NFE. CapEx increased as a result of the investments for NFE transformation as well. \r\nPage 27. The Supply Chain division continued its solid performance, benefiting from a strong trend in new business generation and also good growth in many existing contracts. Division revenues rose by almost 7%, driven in part by the new business, particularly in the consumer and life sciences sectors as well as due to currency effects. The division's operating profit declined in Q4, due principally to the last year's EUR 30 million one-off positive effect in Q4. And excluding that effect, EBIT would have been up by around 9%. \r\nCapEx is higher than last year due to investments in the new business projects and also to fleet replacement. \r\nNow let me turn on Page 29 to our guidance for the year. And today, we announce a concrete guidance for 2015 and also confirm our guidance for 2016. The group expects 2015 to be another year of increased operating earnings towards a range of EUR 3.05 billion to EUR 3.2 billion. We expect post eCommerce and Parcel to contribute at least EUR 1.3 billion, and the DHL divisions should continue to grow earnings towards an EBIT of EUR 2.1 billion to EUR 2.25 billion. \r\nWe project Corporate Center expenses will remain around EUR 350 million. And in addition, the company expects to, again, generate sufficient free cash flow to cover the dividend for the financial year 2014, which we anticipate to pay in the coming month of May. \r\nLooking toward 2016, we confirm our forecast to increase operating profit to between EUR 3.4 billion and EUR 3.7 billion. PeP is expected to generate earnings above EUR 1.3 billion in 2016, while the DHL divisions should contribute between EUR 2.45 billion and EUR 2.75 billion. \r\nAnd looking on Page 30. We discuss here a bit the drivers for the guidance, and we expect that continued gains from Parcel and eCommerce will slightly overbalance the effects from further letter volume declines and also factor cost increases.\r\nThe DHL EBIT gain will be mainly driven by growth in Express and time-definite international volume growth and also the continued marginal expansion of our operating profit margins for Express. \r\nAt the same time, operating earnings at Global Forwarding Freight and Supply Chain will incur temporary costs for their transformation and restructuring programs in 2015.\r\nIn Corporate Center/Other, we will continue to maintain strict cost discipline, and we think we'll remain around the level of 2014 at EUR 350 million.\r\nOverall, these actions will enable us to stay on our growth path and make 2015 another year with solid EBIT growth. \r\nIn summing up then on Page 31, we had a solid performance in 2014 and we delivered on all of our guidance targets. And we expect further solid progress in 2015. In line with Strategy 2020, we expect EBIT to increase by an average of more than 8% per year between 2013 and 2020, whereby the DHL divisions are expected to contribute an average EBIT growth of around 10%, and PeP we expect to grow an average by around 3%. Furthermore, we expect to reduce Corporate Center costs in relation to total group revenues to below 0.5% by 2020.\r\nWe're confident that we're on the right course with our strategic priorities, which will result in higher top line growth, higher EBIT margins and higher cash generation. And we thank our investors for their trust and confidence in the company. Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\nAll right. Thank you, Frank. Thank you, Larry. And operator, we will be now ready to open the Q&A session.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Martin Ziegenbalg (Executives)】\nThank you, and good afternoon or good morning, wherever you are to the investor conference call on the full year 2014 results of Deutsche Post DHL group. I take it you have got the material that you could download or find on the app in front of you. And we have, as announced, the group's CEO, Frank Appel, with us as well as the group's CFO, Larry Rosen. I will hand over to them for the presentations. Afterwards, as usual, sufficient time for Q&A. And with that, I'd like to hand over to you, Frank.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nHello from our side as well, and thank you for joining us today on our 2014 numbers. Let me go straight away into the summary, which is on Page 3 of the document. I think that summarized quite well where we ended up in 2014. We -- I think 2014 was a preparation year and a good step in the right direction. Express actually has performed pretty well with them EBIT -- 10% EBIT margins, which we had for years, achieved 1 year early than originally planned. I think that's great. You see also strong growth in the PeP division for parcels and a very moderate decline, which is actually less than what we originally guided years ago with 2% to 3% decline and it was again -- it was better in mail. We have our challenges with our cost position, particularly with the salary level. You might have followed that we have done something. I'll come to that later on as well but that has, of course, had impact on our EBIT numbers here as well. The transformation in DGF with the NFE program is a key priority and will remain a key priority. In summary, here, it appears to be more challenging when we expect it, but I believe we are taking the right actions to get it back on track. \r\nSupply Chain. We are pretty pleased with the new strategy where we guided you that we will make mid-term 4% to 5% margins. We improved it. John Gilbert and his team have taken first actions. You can see that in the numbers. We had good growth and even more growth on the bottom line. So therefore, we believe that our story is still intact. We have a very strong portfolio of divisions. We are well exposed to the major trends, emerging markets in eCommerce. We have, as I'll explain later, a very clear roadmap to improve the profitability with clear goals. And I think we showed another year where we improved the cash flow. And you definitely have some questions with regard to 2013 and '14 cash flow, and Larry will comment on that later. \r\nSo overall, we will give you today a guidance -- more concrete guidance for this year. We said last summer, as you remember, significantly improvement, and I think our guidance confirms that today. We reconfirmed our targets for 2016 and '20. \r\nSo one thing I would like to mention, it's not important, it doesn't cost too much money because it's a tiny change, but important, we want to now call the company not Deutsche Post DHL but Deutsche Post DHL Group because it makes clear, particularly in countries where we still use different brands, that they belong to the group. So that's the purpose of that. \r\nSo on the next page, you see the high-level annual numbers for the group. We had good growth for the group of 3% organically, actually 4%, though currency was still to our disadvantage last year on the top line. Overall, all divisions grew, Express the most, and the others followed. \r\nOn the bottom line, on the EBIT, you can see as well, we had a good year where we ended up in our range, as guided. We have slight improvement in PeP, but the trend is still the same. That's the reason why we are now in challenging discussions with our unions. We have the same -- the growth on the top line is bigger than on the bottom line. Express has developed very well. We had another year with double-digit bottom line growth based on market share gains. [indiscernible] has been challenged, and that continued in the fourth quarter. We have learned a lot from the pilots, but as I said, the change of structure processes and system is quite a stretch for the organization and definitely has taken away management attention from the day-to-day, therefore, you see as well, here, impact from the day-to-day business, and that's the reason why we decided that we had some growth on the top line, we have seen a significant decline on the bottom line. Of course, we are not satisfied with that, but it's sometimes difficult. If you want to transform a business model, you have to bite the bullet once in a while and -- but we are confident that we can change that trend in the coming times. \r\nSo Supply Chain, nice growth on the top line. If you forget the one-time things in the fourth quarter last year, we probably would be more around 10% EBIT development. I think that's a good result of making the organization leaner, more focused and more standardized. \r\nSo overall, we are pleased to -- that we delivered, as promised, again, and we had another nice uplift. It's a year -- 2015 will be a year of transition from the old strategy to the new strategy. As I said, I think that is necessary to really go then furthermore aspiration that goes until 2020. \r\nPage 5 summarizes briefly the trend for volumes. We're always [ph] at 3 -- 2% to 3% decline. We ended up somewhere between 1% and 2% overall, which is slightly less than expected. It's much better than many other post operators perform. We believe that's a consequence of great quality for a decent price. \r\nParcel volumes remain strong. Fourth quarter was very strong, actually, which is good news, of course. The trend is in good shape and we see really nice development. I will explain later on that we have started to expand our business beyond Germany. This is first good results and also the E-Post team has delivered for the first time more than EUR 300 million. \r\nWe have a challenge with the wage situation we have in PeP. We are tackling that at the moment by creating new subsidiaries with lower salaries, which are still fair and attractive but significantly lower than what we have currently. That will definitely lead to some dispute with the union, but as always, we -- I believe we will find a way sooner or later to get that sorted out, too. \r\nPage 6 is Express. Very consistent, very nice development on both revenue per day and shipments per day, and as I said, another very good year of margin improvement and 1 year ahead of the original plan. I think that's a great result. And we have no doubt 2014 was another year where we gain, on a global scale, market share. \r\nGlobal Forwarding Freight. We have seen growth again, which is good, not only in Air Freight but also in Ocean Freight. But I repeat myself to a certain extent, it is a challenge. It takes management attention this way, it is probably also more complex than the we originally planned. But we believe that what we have seen, the pilots with the approach we are taking will work, probably preparation, some challenges with complexity probably have to be adapted, and then we are ready to go for the next step. But it's at the moment challenging and you see that in our numbers. So as I said, we are not happy about that. But once in a while, you have to bite the bullet and have to go through these things. And the measures we have taken over the last months, that [indiscernible] and his team have taken, should help us to get back on track. \r\nSupply Chain. Group performance continued. The EUR 1.2 billion in new signings is almost half of the next total revenue -- of the total revenue of the next competitor some more [ph], so we had gained again a lot of business with the focus on certain sectors. The focus on standardization and making the organization leaner is paying off, and you can see that more even in the bottom line than in the top line. \r\nSo the strategic priorities, I'm switching to Page 10. There's nothing new. We launched our strategy Focus.Connect.Grow for 2020 last April. You can see here that we still believe and are confident that we will benefit from eCommerce and the emerging markets. We have a very good portfolio exposed to these trends in particular. We have clear [indiscernible], as I explain again and remind you for all divisions to improve the profitability and our balance sheet becomes more and more flexible, having again another year where we generated more free cash flow than the dividend. \r\nSo on Page 11. Just an example from the eCommerce world. We have done already a lot in Europe. We have started recently in Slovakia for domestic B2C parcels. We have -- on the bottom left, you see that we have expanded our drop points already for consumers. We believe that this is a key differentiator in end markets for how easy you have access to the network. We have done that already and tripled the volumes almost, and we started as well a more comprehensive service in one of the countries, or 2 countries, like the Netherlands and Belgium, and on the other side, we introduced our portal we operate in Germany for a while already through Poland, and this is all up and running. So the team in Europe is doing great. They are making great progress, of course. It's all relatively small in comparison to the scale of the company. But the E-Post journey started slow as well, and now we have EUR 300 million revenue. So I think we will see similar things here in the eCommerce arena as well. \r\nOn Page 12, you can see and quite heavy above that, that for the first time since many years, all our divisions have grown faster their volume, or in Supply Chain's case, the revenue, faster than the underlying GDP growth was, which is good sign because obviously, we are in markets where you can grow and our market position is such that we can grow faster than the worldwide GDP. As -- that was our aspiration in our Strategy 2020. \r\nOn Page 13, you see a summary of the different journeys we went through so far and want to continue. The PeP -- the expansion of eCommerce and Parcels is clear. The optimization of all cost position, Germany is clear. That all should lead to a 3% EBIT CAGR until 2020, and we believe that this is achievable. In Express, the focus on TDI will continue. We will remain very much focused on service quality. That's the reason why we are investing into the hubs and gateways significantly in all of our fleet, because we believe that this is a competitive advantage. We put that all into our plan, and now, we will talk about our CapEx guidance later, but we are very confident that we can stay ahead of a game by really upgrading our service quality continuously. \r\nDGFF, the new Forwarding environment is important and is right and is challenging. Those of you who are following our competitors in the industry know that we are not the only one who have some challenges. It is a difficult journey for such a trading business, but we believe that we have found the right approach. We still have to optimize the approach, but still, we believe that the way going forward is right and we will continue to do so to really close the gap of EBIT performance to competitors. \r\nSupply Chain. The new standardization overhead leverage and portfolio management should give us better margins. John Gilbert in a tutorial recently gave you a commitment as well that we can make it 4% to 5%. After what I have seen for the first year, I'm very confident that this is still good. There is tremendous momentum in his organization, and I'm very happy about the progress we have seen already in the first 12 months. \r\nPage 14 shows you as well, going back a little bit, what's been our aspirations. Yes, we wanted to stabilize the EBIT and PeP about EUR 1 billion and 2 years in a row significantly ahead of that and even never even were close to this EUR 1 billion. So 5 years ago, probably everybody thought this is a nice aspiration, but how should that happen, and I remember some of the discussions we had with some of you even way, who said, this is America. How are you going to make it happen? I think we have demonstrated that we are capable to turn this division around from shrinking into a growth engine for the company. \r\nOn the right side, you see the margins for the DHL divisions. We have progressed in 2 divisions pretty well. And DGF, which has been the strongest-performing division, not by margin but absolute terms for a long, long period is challenged at the moment. And as I said, I and we feel confident that we can return to levels which we had or even better in due course, but it is a challenge to do that. \r\nSo then finally, from my side, on the dividend, we are happy that we can propose the AGM another increase of our dividend by EUR 0.05 to EUR 0.85. It's a good history now. We're having increase in dividends in the last 5 years continuously. We are in the middle of our range, as promised. We have a clear finance policy, which is unchanged and we will continue of course to look into free cash flow and the usage of free cash flow the same way as we have done before. \r\nSo that's from my side. So overall, a solid year. We have delivered as we have guided. We believe that we have started the journey to create the right platform for 2020. 2015, really a year of solid transformation and preparation. I usually call that internally. We are now moving from the first S curve to the next, and that is linked to some challenges in the numbers, short term. I mean, that we have expenses we have to digest, but we feel that this necessary to really go then to the next S curve and deliver our aspiration until 2020.\r\nSo thank you very much for listening. With that, I hand over to Larry.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nThank you, and good afternoon to everybody. I'm pleased to continue the presentation now and take a deeper look at our financial performance for the full year 2014 and also Q4 that will include a review of each division, and then I'll finish up with a review of our guidance for 2015 and '16. \r\nSo onto Page 17. We see the group P&L for the full year 2014. The revenue increased by over 3% on a reported basis and organically, group revenues rose 4.2% in the year, supported by especially steady volume and revenue gains in the international express and German parcel businesses. \r\nOperating profit grew by 3.5% or around EUR 100 million to EUR 2.965 billion and was in the targeted range of EUR 2.9 billion to EUR 3.1 billion. The financial result declined mainly due to positive one-off benefits from the first half of 2013. \r\nThe tax rate increased to 15.5%, consistent with our guidance of around 16%, but expenses were higher as the rate was a bit higher than we had last year. And due to those developments in financial and tax expenses, net profit declined very slightly to EUR 2.07 billion. \r\nOn Page 18, we see the group P&L for Q4. Revenues in the final quarter showed strong growth with 6.3% as we finally got some currency tailwind. Organic revenue growth was similar to the full year with 4.1%. EBIT increased by around 2% to EUR 905 million. Excluding the EUR 30 million positive one-off that we had last year in the Supply Chain business in Q4, EBIT growth would have been around 5.5%. \r\nPeP division contributed with a strong gain of 13.6%, reflecting Parcel volume growth following a very strong seasonal pattern around Christmas time in the eCommerce business. The good PeP results were partially offset by an EBIT decline in the DHL divisions, and this was mainly due to the transformation program, NFE, in our Global Forwarding business and a large positive one-off that I already mentioned in the Supply Chain business in Q4 last year. \r\nExpress, again, had strong TDI volume growth across all regions with an increase of almost 12% in the EBIT. Consolidated net profit declined by 17% to EUR 640 million, again, as a result of higher interest expense and a higher tax rate. \r\nIn Q4 of 2013, we had a tax income reflecting the adjustment we made in that quarter to bring the full year rate down to 14%. \r\nPage 19, we see our cash flow performance for Q4. Overall operating cash flow was again very strong, with over EUR 1 billion of operating cash flow and even slightly exceeded what was last year already a very strong performance in Q4. And we had, again, a year-end decline in working capital, supporting altogether the very good operating cash flow performance of EUR 1.66 billion. \r\nAnd a higher CapEx spend in Q4 brought the full year level of free cash flow generation then in line with the strong 2014 level. As last year, part of the CapEx will be cashed out in the current year, though likely not as much as we had at the beginning of 2014 as a spillover from 2013. \r\nOverall free cash flow for the year was over EUR 1.3 billion, comfortably exceeding our forecast of surpassing or exceeding the dividend we paid last May of around EUR 1 billion. \r\nOn Page 20, keeping on the cash flow subject, we're especially pleased about the progress of cash flow generation over the last several years. After several years, many years, of below-average performance and very significant cash outflows for restructuring, we have, in the last 2 years been able to comfortably cover the substantial dividend that we pay in May of each year. And this is due, of course, to our improved operating performance, the very good working capital management and, of course, the significant reduction in outflows for restructuring. \r\nAnd we've been able to do this even with higher CapEx investments, reflecting our investments into growth and in our strategy with the biggest investments coming in Express and in the Parcel business. \r\nCash flow is really important to us. It's embedded in all of our management incentive systems. It has become a key part of our daily decision-making and also strategic deliberation. \r\nOn Page 21, you see our net debt evolution for the year 2014, and we're pleased that with the very strong performance in Q4, we could bring the total debt level exactly in line with the end of 2013 despite having spent more on CapEx and having paid a higher dividend this year than we did the previous year. We expect to, again, follow our seasonal pattern in 2015 so that our net debt should increase during the first half of the year and then improve considerably during the second half. \r\nOn Page 22, a deep dive or a medium dive into the subject of pensions. And it's an important subject because there's been such change in the liabilities and results associated with pensions, but also because of the still recent accounting change. And under the new standard, IAS 19R, our pension liability or defined benefit obligation increases when interest rates, or more precisely, the discount rate for pensions declines. Over the year 2014, this led the pension liability, the gross pension liability, to grow by more than EUR 3 billion, but thanks to very strong performance of our pension assets, the net provision went up by a little more than EUR 2 billion to EUR 7.1 billion by year end. \r\nIn Q4, despite another decrease in the discount rate, our net pension provision was even slightly down just considering the quarter.\r\nThinking about the future, on the P&L we would expect a slight increase in personnel costs in the low double-digit range and, of course, no change in cash flow generation. \r\nSo Page 23. We'll start to look at the individual division performance for Q4, and we'll start with PeP. So revenues climbed by 4.1% to EUR 4.35 billion in Q4. It was our strongest growth quarter for the year and reflected especially the continued growth in parcel volumes along with small price increases that came at the beginning and some at the middle of the year and overall, more than offset the letter volume decline that we saw in Q4. \r\nEBIT performance was very good, with a high contribution from eCommerce and Parcel, including a very strong year-end seasonal impact and good cost control.\r\nOperating cash flow increased by over 30%, driven by improved working capital development and also, of course, the increased EBIT. CapEx declined but it purely reflects phasing effects in our overall higher investments in Parcel infrastructure expansion. \r\nPage 24. I want to focus here on an interesting development in PeP reporting. And over the last 2 years, we have reduced our provision for purchase, but not yet used stamps by EUR 50 million each year. Last year, we categorized the provision release as a nonrecurring or extraordinary event. But as we've observed consumer behavior again this year, we see the development more as a normal part of our business. \r\nFollowing 15 years of price stability in Germany, we now have increased the stamp price slightly in each of the last 3 years. As a result, as soon as we announced the increase in the fall, when it's approved by the regulator, we observed that consumers draw down their stock of stamps with the old price and buy fewer new stamps. We think that with the current practice of regular price increases, overall inventory levels are reduced on average and this is then reflected in the provision movement. \r\nOverall, the change in provision is roughly in line with the lower stamp sales, so that their combined effect on revenue and EBIT is about neutral. \r\nSo Page 25. Express revenues and EBIT continue to reflect the strong trends from the previous quarters, where we continue to grow faster than the market and have seen a very positive development in EBIT growth and margins. The division's revenue rose by around 10%, reflecting continued strong TDI volume growth across all regions. Adjusted for exchange rate effects, revenue increased by about 6.6%. \r\nEBIT increased by almost 12%, reflecting higher volumes combined with continued good cost management and higher efficiency in the aviation and ground networks. The 2014 EBIT margin climbed to 10 -- for the full year, climbed to 10.1% and with this, already exceeded the projected 10% margin that we originally targeted for 2015. \r\nCapEx increased year-over-year as we spent more on upgrading and improving our global and regional hubs in Leipzig, Brussels, Cincinnati, Singapore and Dubai. And the investments also included expanding and renewing our air fleet, upgrading customer service and investing in other quality measures. \r\nPage 26. We look at Global Forwarding and Freight. And it's pretty much a continuation of the developments we've seen in previous quarters. In a still-challenging industry environment, DGFF, Global Forwarding and Freight, achieved a revenue increase of almost 5%, and it's been driven by volume recovery in Air and Ocean Freight as well as some minor foreign exchange effects. But division operating profit fell by 48.6%, as continued low gross profit margins were coupled with high direct and indirect costs associated with implementation of our transformation program, NFE. CapEx increased as a result of the investments for NFE transformation as well. \r\nPage 27. The Supply Chain division continued its solid performance, benefiting from a strong trend in new business generation and also good growth in many existing contracts. Division revenues rose by almost 7%, driven in part by the new business, particularly in the consumer and life sciences sectors as well as due to currency effects. The division's operating profit declined in Q4, due principally to the last year's EUR 30 million one-off positive effect in Q4. And excluding that effect, EBIT would have been up by around 9%. \r\nCapEx is higher than last year due to investments in the new business projects and also to fleet replacement. \r\nNow let me turn on Page 29 to our guidance for the year. And today, we announce a concrete guidance for 2015 and also confirm our guidance for 2016. The group expects 2015 to be another year of increased operating earnings towards a range of EUR 3.05 billion to EUR 3.2 billion. We expect post eCommerce and Parcel to contribute at least EUR 1.3 billion, and the DHL divisions should continue to grow earnings towards an EBIT of EUR 2.1 billion to EUR 2.25 billion. \r\nWe project Corporate Center expenses will remain around EUR 350 million. And in addition, the company expects to, again, generate sufficient free cash flow to cover the dividend for the financial year 2014, which we anticipate to pay in the coming month of May. \r\nLooking toward 2016, we confirm our forecast to increase operating profit to between EUR 3.4 billion and EUR 3.7 billion. PeP is expected to generate earnings above EUR 1.3 billion in 2016, while the DHL divisions should contribute between EUR 2.45 billion and EUR 2.75 billion. \r\nAnd looking on Page 30. We discuss here a bit the drivers for the guidance, and we expect that continued gains from Parcel and eCommerce will slightly overbalance the effects from further letter volume declines and also factor cost increases.\r\nThe DHL EBIT gain will be mainly driven by growth in Express and time-definite international volume growth and also the continued marginal expansion of our operating profit margins for Express. \r\nAt the same time, operating earnings at Global Forwarding Freight and Supply Chain will incur temporary costs for their transformation and restructuring programs in 2015.\r\nIn Corporate Center/Other, we will continue to maintain strict cost discipline, and we think we'll remain around the level of 2014 at EUR 350 million.\r\nOverall, these actions will enable us to stay on our growth path and make 2015 another year with solid EBIT growth. \r\nIn summing up then on Page 31, we had a solid performance in 2014 and we delivered on all of our guidance targets. And we expect further solid progress in 2015. In line with Strategy 2020, we expect EBIT to increase by an average of more than 8% per year between 2013 and 2020, whereby the DHL divisions are expected to contribute an average EBIT growth of around 10%, and PeP we expect to grow an average by around 3%. Furthermore, we expect to reduce Corporate Center costs in relation to total group revenues to below 0.5% by 2020.\r\nWe're confident that we're on the right course with our strategic priorities, which will result in higher top line growth, higher EBIT margins and higher cash generation. And we thank our investors for their trust and confidence in the company. Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Martin Ziegenbalg (Executives)】\nAll right. Thank you, Frank. Thank you, Larry. And operator, we will be now ready to open the Q&A session.",
      "transcript_text3": "Maybe not surprisingly, can I just go to the Forwarding division. Maybe could you just give more detail where you see the time line there. Maybe how it's progressing by geography or by country in terms of pulling in the systems and the processes. And I'm assuming that the guidance for 2016 does assume some positive output and implementation from that.\n\n---\n\nYes. Let me take that question. So I think we are not ready yet to give you a more detailed outlook. I think we have, starting in November, December, after we stopped the rollout to China, I think we have said we have to learn more in-depth what is going on with the pilot countries. We are working intensively at the moment to really demonstrate that our pilot countries are back to normal and we are making good progress there. But I think we have learned a lot and therefore, we have changed approach -- the approach. We have 3 major work streams at the moment. One is that we want to understand how can we improve the system as such, what we have reflected in the system, by adding certain things and by de-complexing in certain areas. The second is we intensively are looking into the end-to-end processes to de-bottleneck because we figured out that we have some bottlenecks which are in the software. We have to solve that. And finally, we have learned as well from the pilot countries that preparation of the countries has to be different, and we are heavily looking into that. We thought it is more prudent to now really come to our conclusions out of what I've just outlined instead of talking about a new rollout plan, that it's better to say, let's learn what we have or let's debrief what we have learned and then create. So it will take some time still until we really can give you a new plan. That's the reason why it's also a little bit more challenging how much benefits we will see next year, and we will come back to that later when we know more how the rollout will be. But we are confident on the other side that the group guidance we have given is achievable, despite that we are changing here somehow the time line. And I think that's the best we can say at the moment. We are looking into that in depth, Roger and his team, and I think they found good root causes analysis and the consequences of that. But as I said, it's too early to give you a more detailed plan at the current stage.\n\n---\n\nAll right. That's fair. And if I could just have one quick follow-up. In terms of where the GP margins are in Ocean and Air Freight, do you think those declines are largely, let's say, market-related, is it certain verticals like the IT sector or it's, again, a function of the company being internally focused to some extent, clearly because of the importance of the project?\n\n---\n\nI believe that it's several root causes. It's definitely market-driven. We are more exposed than others to big customers, to technology. But at the same time, there is no doubt that with the direction we have given the organization, we have distracted the organization from what they are good at. To be honest, we have not been as good in trading the day-to-day and the cycle of the market as we have been. And that is because people are working more on the transformation and preparation and data quality. If you tell sales people you have to bring contracts into the system, you can't be out to the customers and win new business while dealing with operational issues. And in hindsight, we probably underestimated a little bit how big the gap is where we are at the moment and where we have to be to use an SAP system. And that had impact on the day-to-day as well, despite that we are disadvantaged, but I think I would more say -- and that's probably different from what we have said before, the distraction of the management and the people is bigger than we thought in autumn last year.\n\n---\n\n2 questions for me. First of all, on the Express business. Going back a couple of years, I remember sort of the '14, '15 period was going to be one of convergence, particularly as you brought all the countries onto similar sort of IT platforms and systems. Could you talk just a little bit more about where you are in that process, whether it's complete? And then given the investment in hubs, depots, airlifting capacity, whether you are now moving back to a more share-focused strategy and we go through that 3-year process again? And then secondly, more generally on the sort of the IT and the sort of standardization, industrialization of the business. As you go through this in the Express business, you still aim to get there in Forwarding and are going through it in the Supply Chain business, at what point does it start to make sense to start looking at bolt-on acquisitions once you've got the sort of scalability of platform to do those?\n\n---\n\nYes, so let me answer with regard to the -- where we are with Express. I think we made great progress and the majority of all these things are done. The story never ends, to be honest. And I'm now on the IT board for all 3 years, I'm sharing that. And if you talk about IT, that story never ends. We -- Ken and his team is looking already to upgrading our functionality with many dimensions, be it billing or functionalities for digital features and so on and so forth. So I think, as we originally outlined, that is almost completed, and we are already -- and they are working already to upgrade our capabilities further, which is, of course, related to -- there is more international B2C and we have to find new answers. There are social media who are interacting differently than just call centers. So it will never stop. What originally was planned, I think, as I said, is almost done. And we are already in the progress of doing more in new things. And that's the reason why Ken has definitely the aspiration to close the gap to our biggest or strongest competitors even further. That's a journey we are on at the moment after we delivered a good margin already 1 year early. What is of extreme importance, and this is high on the priority list for Express, is service quality, service quality, service quality. We are -- have been so successful because we have done terrifically on that. So all the IT sides are looking from the service angle, do we need then to be better and more responsive to customers, and I think Ken has a very clear agenda of then doing that and he's demonstrated to do that, so I'm very optimistic with regard to that. All the standardizations are probably very unlikely to M&A because if I go through the different divisions, in Express, it's probably impossible to acquire somebody anyway. If I understand TNT's strategy, they want more focus on road anyway, which is not our core in Express. In Supply Chain, as I said, we have won almost half the business of the next competitors, while going through that, I think our key target has to be, we win on a standardized scalable operation, and we see that in some markets. We have great progress in China, for instance, with our business there. And that is based by rolling out good solutions of the very strong management. And in Forwarding, if we are through that, I think we can gain significant share from particular smaller and midsize forwarders. And so why acquiring them when we can grow organically. So I believe what we are doing is that we really want to make our business model more attractive, and that should bring us significant additional organic growth potential. And I can't see at the moment why any major add-on acquisition would make sense. So that's our prospective and has been for a while. We are well positioned. That makes me actually confident. The problems we face can be internally managed and are not dependent on strong growth or filling white spots and whatever. They do not make everything right always, that's normal as well. We are only human beings as well but they are controllable from us and that makes me confident that we are in a very good journey to 2020, even if sometimes the short term is more challenging than we thought.\n\n---\n\nSo maybe let me take a shot at the question on the increased investments in hubs and airlift. I think it's much less a matter of a 3-year cycle than us investing in the success that we've had and that we anticipate in the Express business worldwide. When we opened Leipzig several years ago, it was sized for 3% growth per year. And we've been growing consistently at more than double that rate. So it's really investing in the great position and great success that we've had. Asia is another example. So despite having opened our second global hub in Asia, in Shanghai, 2 years ago, which then provided some relief for our Hong Kong hub, which was our first hub in Asia and was already full, we see the need to invest further in yet a third hub in Singapore, and we announced last week that we'd invest over EUR 100 million in Changi Airport in Singapore. So I don't think it relates to a cycle of investing and then reaping benefits and then somehow repeating every 3 years. I think it is a continuous upgrade process and success is just feeding on itself and as we're more successful, we'll invest as much as we need to, to maintain our -- and grow our leadership position.\n\n---\n\nI have 2 questions. One on the guidance regarding FX effects. So the guidance for 2015 is based on what kind of U.S. dollar-euro relation, on the backdrop of the currently very depressed euro? And second, in this respect, at the rule of thumb, what does a decline in euro translate in EBIT improvement for you? And the second question is on the minimum wage in Germany. Could you explain which effects this has on you and especially on your suppliers? And in addition, what effect is there for your competitive landscape?\n\n---\n\nMaybe, Larry, you answer question 1 and 2, and I'll talk about the minimum wage. So I think it's too early to judge. It has relatively modest impact on us because we, ourselves, employ people above the minimum wage anyway. Of course, we are working with subcontractors, particularly the trucking, and we will ensure that they are paying minimum wage. That is somehow funneling through because that's a common theme for everybody. So if we have a lift in cost across the board, and of course, our customers will look into that as well, that we are following the guidelines that our subcontractors were following. So it will probably lead to a slight price increase for the market, but that will be funneled through. In the mail business, in particular, where we have competition, of course, we paid less than that. We have to wait how that is really implemented and how the government really can follow what the people do. The challenge is not what they get paid per hour, the question is how many hours they work. And if you have couriers on the road, we can't send individuals behind couriers and check how many hours they work. And therefore, we expect not a fundamental change but it's up to the government to check what they are doing. Many of our competitors are working with subcontractors and small companies. They usually don't have workers' council. Their workers' council are best to check time, which has worked, but we will see. So it's too early to say, I believe, what the impact is. We have not anticipated significant positive impact. It means negative impact or cost increases for our competitors, yet in our guidance, we think that this has -- will have marginal impact on the market competition. So we are -- they are probably on the conservative side. We might be pleased during the year that this is implemented more than before and then we should have positive impact because it definitely will increase the cost base, in particular in the mail business for our competitors if it's applied correctly. But as I said, it's more the question how much that can be controlled. And therefore, let's wait and see. It's not embedded a major shift in the market in our numbers for PeP. So we -- there might be a positive surprise but it's too early to say.\n\n---\n\nYes, so let me answer the questions on FX. The guidance that we've announced today is based on rates that are reasonably close to the current rates. And the interesting question is what does it mean for us. And the first thing to note is that in the dollar area, we have our exposure in income and expenses in U.S. dollars themselves. And then very significant exposures in other currencies that are closely related to the U.S. dollar, like the Chinese yuan, the Hong Kong dollar, the Singapore dollar and several others. If we take all of our income and expenses together, we're pretty well balanced in -- as the whole company in terms of U.S. dollars. So it doesn't make a big difference if the euro strengthens or weakens versus the U.S. dollar. Remember that fuel costs are driven by U.S. dollar pricing. So even fuel costs that we have in other currencies are directly influenced by U.S. dollar costs for energy. And so we have fairly significant expenses in -- for fuel in addition to very significant income on the U.S. dollar side, in total, as I said, it's pretty well balanced. So then the question is well, what about all the other currencies? The weaker euro for sure has a significant positive impact for some currencies. Those are namely the British pound and the Japanese yen, where we have net long positions. On the other hand, there's a few currencies where we have exposure where we -- where there's very significant weakness even against the euro like the Russian ruble, like some of the Latin American currencies. So with the current rate environment, there's neither a big advantage or a big disadvantage that we have from movements in currencies to their current levels.\n\n---\n\nA question on the Express division. Since you guys are a strong player in the Asia export market, did you see in the fourth quarter or are you seeing, I guess, currently here in the first quarter, any benefit from the West Coast ports congestion that's been going on in the U.S., in terms of additional Asia-U.S. air freight volumes?\n\n---\n\nSo there, you don't mean the Express business, you mean our Forwarding business? So...\n\n---\n\nActually in both.\n\n---\n\nBoth. Okay. Yes, generally, we've seen good trends over the last couple of weeks and start of the year in Air Freight volumes. Whether -- how much of that is directly related to the West Coast port issue is very hard to say.\n\n---\n\nYes, maybe to add, so in Express, it's probably marginal because people who are putting something on vessels on oceans will not change to Express tomorrow. On air freight, it had some impact on some routes, yes. And we have seen good volume growth not only there but overall. So it had positive impact on air freight, unfortunately on our bottom line number but on volume growth. So -- but in Express, it's very marginal. We had a very strong performance in Asia overall in Express. And it shows -- our development shows how well we are exposed to the interest -- most interesting markets in that industry anyways. So that had continued through but the impact on the port congestion was very limited on Express. Question answered, Dave?\n\n---\n\nYes. And then another question just on Express. The yield side. Yields were down year-over-year in the quarter. Could you comment, I guess, Larry, on how much of that was lower fuel surcharges versus any mix issues? And then what kind of you're seeing in terms of core pricing in the market?\n\n---\n\nYes. Virtually all of it had to do with the lower fuel costs and the lower fuel surcharges. There were other minor factors, but they netted pretty much to a breakeven in terms of yield development.\n\n---\n\nAnd then long term, is the goal at Express to have yields rise just to cover costs and then the margin expansion is going to come from growth in volumes? Or is there any effort to kind of push price to help with that margin expansion?\n\n---\n\nSo I think the strategy in the last year has been right and we will continue. We will now win the game on service quality. And fortunately, we have gained significant market share on service quality. We will continue as a market leader to continuously increase prices but not in a way to make compromises on the growth potential. So our priority to grow the business back on service quality. There is scale still to gain through further growth and that's a strategy. And I think we have done that quite successfully in the past years. We will not now switch gears and say let's maximize now the yield. We believe we have to keep price increases and service quality and growth beyond the market in balance. And that is what the strategy has been in the last years and that has led to the success. So we will not compromise neither on service quality nor on growth just to maximize the short-term yield. Because I think we believe that's a dangerous game, we should not start that. The good news is the industry has behaved in the last years, very rational. None of the competitors really said, let's start a price war, whatsoever. They all understand that this will damage the industry, so we are really competing on service quality and we will not change it either. So that's where we are and we will continue to do so.\n\n---\n\n2 questions for me, one on Parcels and one again on NFE. On Parcels, I wonder if you could say a little bit more about how buoyant the volumes were in Q4. I mean, you mentioned in the press release seasonal effects, but then listening to you now, it sounded like eCommerce and possibly structural factors were also at work. So I wonder if you're really doing yourself justice there. And the second question on the NFE, you've mentioned a couple of times its impact both in terms of direct and indirect costs. I guess I think I know what the indirect -- the direct costs are. Perhaps you could explain a little bit more about the indirect costs that you see arising from the NFE. That's it.\n\n---\n\nYes, so -- and Larry may take the first, I'll take the second. So in NFE, of course, we had also a more indirect expenses because the people are in training, we have expenses on training, people are -- because we have day-to-day business. We have added, of course, FTEs to that and that has, of course, impact on the bottom line. So yes, it's not only direct. That means we are not doing as good as we have done in trading but also we had higher indirect costs as well.\n\n---\n\nSo yes. On the Parcel business, we had a very strong year-end season. If you go to Page 5 of the presentation, you see that growth in parcel volumes in Germany in Q4 was close to 8.5% compared to an average of 7% for the full year. So Q4 was a very strong quarter. We have seen that last year as well. And it's really due to the surge in eCommerce business and volumes that are happening around the Christmas season.\n\n---\n\nMaybe one interesting observation which we probably have not shared but it's worth to mention. While we have seen differently, despite a tremendous growth, we have seen lower difference about the peak days and the normal days in December. So what happens actually, we -- it's too early to say that this is a trend. But currently, people are behaving more normal now in the eCommerce world than just saying, oh, that's a last minute gift I buy. You see that more in the retail. The last 4 weekends before Christmas, in Germany at least, are very strong sales days anyway. It's not just 1 Saturday, it's 4 Saturdays, and we see that kind of [ph] coming now as well, which is operationally easier to deal with. But it's too early to say that this will happen again. We have seen that this year that the maximum day was not as -- the strongest day was not so much different than other days in the month. And I think this is actually, for operational perspective, better, and it shows that eCommerce is not the last minute purchase, it becomes a normal habit, people just buy what they ever buy for gifts on an online -- in an online way. This is, on the other side, very promising because obviously, the attitude of people is changing even in that period. We have seen that already before. We never had a low season any longer. Usually summer is low season, but we have seen tremendous growth even in this period. And that's another indication that eCommerce is now reality and people are using that like they do shopping in the past. And that is good for us, and it's very promising for the midterm.\n\n---\n\n2 from me. The first one is on DHL guidance for 2016. I mean, that clearly hasn't moved since the third quarter, but you're having greater difficulties restructuring your Freight Forwarding business. And we've also seen a small miss on consensus on the Express division in the fourth quarter. I mean, can you explain what leads to the -- how do we get to the improvement in 2016? Is that just the restructuring from Freight Forwarding falling off? Or are you expecting a pickup in Express as well? And then secondly, on provisions. They're up again year-on-year, can you give us some idea what's going to happen there in 2015 from a cash perspective?\n\n---\n\nSo yes, the 2016 guidance, the primary drivers are, again, further improvement that we expect in the Express business. We do clearly expect that the Supply Chain business is going to be performing better than in 2015, also reflecting significant benefits from the restructuring that we're investing in this year. DGF, as Frank talked about before, it's still too early to give a very definitive forecast about it, but we're confident that altogether, we'll be well in the guidance range of EUR 2.45 billion to EUR 2.75 billion for DHL in total. So provisions, do you mean pension provisions or others?\n\n---\n\nOthers.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Because we had the EUR 2.1 billion increase in pension provisions, of course, related to the lower discount rate. Other provisions have not increased very substantially. So do you mean the impact of changes in provisions in cash flow for the year?\n\n---\n\nYes. Exactly.\n\n---\n\nOkay. There, we had a release of a very significant provision. The biggest part of that change, more than half of it, was the release of a provision that we originally built for cost of change in the Express restructuring that we did back in 2009. We determined by the middle of the year that we didn't need that provision anymore and we could release it. We did, at the same time, our write-down on increase or an accelerated depreciation of part of our air fleet for Express. So the net effect of that provision release and the write-off of remaining depreciation on some older parts of our air fleet, basically offset each other exactly. We discussed that as part of our Q2 reporting last year. And that was really the biggest driver of the provision impact on cash flow, remaining items were a number of smaller impacts.\n\n---\n\nAngus, any further questions?\n\n---\n\nYes, sorry, I mean, just on the guidance, though. So I mean, you seem unwilling to say that we should expect Global Freight Forwarding to necessarily pick up sharply. But then, you're looking for -- I suppose, what I'm saying, is Supply Chain going to be better than we'd expected, say, 3 months ago? And given Express is a little bit softer, are you expecting particular acceleration there into 2016 to make up the shortfall that we're now seeing?\n\n---\n\nMaybe on Express, before we get the wrong notion, so Express has done very well. We delivered in a year earlier. Don't make a judgment on a quarterly basis because, of course, there is phasing of AP&P, there are sometimes some extra costs, we are looking into that to improve performance. We are driven by long-term progress. And therefore, Ken has taken some actions to help our 2 year, this year's and next year's, numbers. We are looking into the overall achievement that we delivered there, 10% margin, 1 year earlier. So there is no reason to believe that we have a margin trend on a quarterly basis. Please take that not too seriously just by looking in the fourth quarter. The overarching trend is very healthy and as I said, we did some AP&P because we felt we had the headroom to do that, and we invested into the long-term success. Supply Chain had a better start last year than we expected under the new leadership. And we see nice progress there, too. We will have some investments this year as well in restructuring and optimization. So we looked into all of that before we reconfirmed the guidance, of course, knowing that we have not a final plan yet for this year and next year for the rollout of NFE. We feel very confident that we can make the margin next year. And of course, we are looking at that constantly. We would not say that if we were not confident that we have enough opportunities in our portfolio to make the numbers. So we stick to a  quantified guidance for the DHL divisions in total, but as you have seen, as a new element of our guidance policy if you like we've introduced a slide now also on what are the drivers on a divisional basis and I think that should be helpful enough.\n\n---\n\nIf I can ask 2 questions please. The first one, with respect to labor cost within PeP for 2015. With an upcoming deal to negotiate, how should we think about the level of labor cost inflation you're prepared for in 2015 and indeed beyond within PeP? And the second question, on cash flow, you've obviously -- Larry, you've obviously touched again the priorities for excess cash flow in the presentation. But it seems to remain somewhat elusive. It's been on the agenda for a few years now. So given the comments with respect to 2015 and 2016, is it fair to think now that 2016 is the -- or the end of 2016 is the earliest point at which we might see excess cash flow?\n\n---\n\nYes, so let me start on labor cost. Of course, we are not believing that we will get -- walk away with 0 increase in salaries this year. So -- but I'm not too happy to share with all of you what we have put in the plan. And we are realistic as well. We have to find common ground. I think what is important is what we are doing at the moment by creating a new salary structure from the delivery subsidiaries is a long-term change of the game somehow. We have to reduce our cost base for new members. A lot of people are leaving due to retirement every year. And if we engage new people on a different level, we can't really make a difference until 2020. Of course, we expect that there will be demands this year for salary increases, and that's not surprising of course, that is embedded in our plan as well. And we will of course work as hard as possible to minimize that. We have not put in our guidance that we will have a 0 increase in salaries this year. So -- but beyond that, I hesitate to talk about that because the unions should not know what we have put into the numbers on that. And therefore, we are confident that we will make at least the EUR 1.3 billion this year.\n\n---\n\nYes. So let me take a crack at the cash flow question. Last year, we generated around EUR 600 million plus, more than we needed for the dividend last year, meaning 2013. This year, meaning 2014, it was around EUR 300 million plus. So we clearly have come to a point where decisions about our financial policy and which direction we want to go are getting much closer, it's much more of a current issue for us today than it was a couple of years ago. Nevertheless, it's a bit too early to say anything more concrete about which direction it's going to go or the exact timing other than to say it's much more of a current issue than it has been in the past.\n\n---\n\n3 questions from me, please. First one is just on NFE. I wonder if you could just remind us in terms of the number of countries that you've got to get around in terms of implementing air and sea SAP systems. I think the number is over 100 countries but I wonder if you can confirm the exact number of countries, please. Secondly, on your PeP guidance for at least -- or at least EUR 1.3 billion, which is what you've delivered in 2014. As Martin pointed out, Slide 30 shows some of the drivers, and the Parcels growth within PeP should only be partially offset by the traditional decline in mail volumes, which should drive PeP up. But given that you've got 2.3 more working days in 2015 versus 2014, which I guess, working off a rough rule of thumb of EUR 50 million per working day, that should probably drive up 9%. I was wondering if you could just comment on how you've arrived at that PeP guidance, please, of at least EUR 1.3 billion. And then maybe one for Larry in terms of pension funding. I think back in 2012, you were kind of at the sort of current net pension deficit levels where you took the decision at the end of 2012 to raise EUR 2 billion of bonds to put against pension plan assets. I wondered, given that we're back to where we are, given these sort of fall-in discount rates, what your thinking is around pensions, because you've obviously got no sort of mandatory requirement to do anything on pensions. But could it be a bond issue? Could that be some of the surplus cash that you talked about heading towards the pension part, please?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Andy, let me answer the first question. So to be honest, I don't know exactly which, I think it's 89 but I can be perfectly wrong as well. So this is the range of countries where we control the business and it's sizeable enough that we will roll out that. As -- this is the same amount of countries where we have lodges [ph], which is the incumbent system rolled out, but to be honest, I think it's 89.\n\n---\n\nIt's over 80.\n\n---\n\nBut I'm not 100% sure.\n\n---\n\nOver 80 countries.\n\n---\n\nBut it's -- I think it's not 100. But Martin probably can figure that out. It's a clear list of countries. So just this is not my priority, is it 89 or 92. The challenge is more to get the right approach done. And then we will see. And the 90-ish countries is relatively small anyway.\n\n---\n\nSo let me answer the last 2 questions. So now the PeP guidance for 2015. Yes, it's true, we have 2.3 more working days, though those days come at the very end of the year. And so it's hard to predict whether they will be -- will have the character of a normal additional working day, which as you said, Andy, as a kind of a rule of thumb, should add around EUR 50 million of revenues and earnings, or whether they'll be less important because of their timing. If they come between Christmas and New Years, it's hard to estimate what the effect of those could be. We've also been a bit cautious on PeP guidance, given the uncertainty on labor costs and where the negotiations are going to come out. Our current labor agreement is expiring at the end of May. And so, of course, we've made a prediction and built the prediction into our plan and therefore into the guidance. But it's, at the same time, hard to predict. So yes. So that's why the guidance for PeP is where it is, that we believe we'll do at least as well as last year. So in pension funding, I think one reason to think about more pension funding is because you're nervous about the amount of unfunded liabilities that you have. That is not the case with us. Nevertheless, we might think about doing additional pension funding for the same reasons that we did it in 2012. And that is that there's accretive effects on both EPS and on cash flow generation, depending on what your assumption is about the return on the invested assets. Given the extremely low costs of financing that are currently available, that is a tempting combination. And so we do have it on the table. We do think about it. We put it in the context of our whole financial policy, and we'll maybe have something more to say about that later in the year.\n\n---\n\nCould I just ask one -- just a small follow-up. On the -- within PeP, what percentage of your PeP employees are in these newly created subsidiaries and also, sort of running -- and therefore running at sort of lower wages than the historical -- than, I guess, the agreements, please?\n\n---\n\nYes, currently, we have 4,000 and it probably will end up at 6,000 until the end of the year. So that's a progression, for the years, it will not change the game immediately. It is a journey, as I said earlier, until 2020.\n\n---\n\nWas that 4,000 at the end of last year going to 6,000?\n\n---\n\nYes, so 4,000 have already a new contract that shows that we offered an attractive package, otherwise people have not signed a contract, and we believe that we can increase that until the end of year to 6,000.\n\n---\n\nMaybe a bit of a harsh questions. But looking at Forwarding, I'm really a bit concerned. It feels like you're cutting costs on a platform that is falling apart a little bit. When I look at Air Freight a lot, just Air Freight forward in the world, when you lost 20% of your gross profit over the past 2 years. So I'd really like to have a little better understanding on why you're losing share or losing quality share. Why you have to make those price concessions. And when you think at least the decline in gross profit will be stopped, anything in terms of granularity there would really help.\n\n---\n\nTobias, I think it is, as I said already, if -- this is a trading business, that means permanent attention on what you are buying and what you are selling. And if you have people on training and preparing organizations, they can't do both at the same time. And as I said already, we probably have underestimated how much attention it takes to move from A to B and how much distraction it takes from a day-to-day business, and that is what we see. The good news in all of that is this is a very fast-moving business. This is not heavy assets. It is you lose a customer and you gain a customer and that's all based on good service quality, service quality has in some places suffered as well because we are touching a lot of people and moving them around somehow. But not too much physically but what their responsibilities are. That has impact. What I think -- see about this, when I talk to the pilot countries and we are live in 5 countries and I have been in the pilot countries myself, the people are very excited about the visibility they get, the process they get, in particular, the younger people. But again, at the front, it is tough, because people lose attention, and in a trading business, you know that as well. Go to the stock market, it's a lot about attention. If you're not listening to all the things which are going on, you lose visibility. The good thing is you lose a customer, you can regain the customer as well because the industry is still not as professionalized as our Express business, where other competitors are delivering quite good service quality. So there, it's a very tight race. In Forwarding, I think, we have opportunities to recover from that. And as I said, we have underestimated the distraction people might get from the transformation. And we see now the results. So I think it is challenging. But it's not messy, I think, it's really -- we have to learn more consistently. If I talk to the employees in the pilot countries, they think that this is better than what they had. It's tough to grow from A to B but they think they can make it happen. And that makes me confident that we can make it happen even on a bigger scale.\n\n---\n\nWhere do you stand in terms of the time line of that? Because we had the same discussion a year ago after Q1 and then you said you had some contract wins and it's been looking encouraging on the market side. And now it seems 12 years -- 12 months later, you're still sort of in the same distraction of the organization. So do you think that will continue throughout the year? Or should we see some stabilization on the gross profit side in the course of the year? How do you think about the gross profit side?\n\n---\n\nSo to predict now exactly everything on that is -- as long as we have not a clear master plan in place, which we are working on currently, is a little bit difficult. 2015 will remain a challenging year without a doubt. And of course, that is embedded into our -- that is anticipated in our guidance we have given you today, that this will be a rough year for DGF without a doubt. And you are saying we said the same 12 months ago, one problem we have not done carefully enough, we have not debriefed the pilots sufficiently. We were more optimistic that depilation -- assimilation happens faster. And it didn't, and therefore, we said now, instead of going through additional pilots now in additional countries, you stop that until the pilot countries are really back to normal. And that has changed, you can say, why you have not done that 6 months earlier? Good question. The answer is because we probably underestimated the challenge. And that is better to admit that and change instead of keep going and say everything will be great tomorrow. I think the things are improving in the right direction. But it's more difficult and more challenging and there's tremendous attention on that. But I think it's better to say, listen, we don't have a new plan yet because we are working on that. Whomever I talk to internally and other people we have seen that, everybody feels encouraged what we are doing is right. The journey from A to B is more challenging.\n\n---\n\nTwo quick questions from my side, just to clarify, on the Q4 metrics that you gave with respect to the geographic Express performance. It seems Americas, on the volume side in Q4, contracted quite significantly in terms of the rate of growth in TDI volumes. Could you explain if there was any specific issues around that as the other regions did seem to perform either in line with the run rates we had seen or in Europe's case, quite a bit better. And my second question is just in relation to when you speak about the pension, Larry, you did mention there would be some kind of offset adjustments to the increase in service costs at the interest line. Can you just give a bit of color on then how to think about the kind of net interest addition on full year 2015 in terms of the absolute amount we should be thinking about?\n\n---\n\nSo yes, the Q4 volume performance in the Americas was driven by a couple factors. Important is our business with DoD and the overall reduction, the Department of Defense and the overall reduction in the level there as we continued to draw down in various engagements, as the U.S. Department of Defense draws down its various engagements around the world. So we had lower volumes with the DoD. Another was Venezuela, where we saw lower volumes associated with the extreme weakness in the Venezuelan economy. Pensions, if I understood your question correctly, it's how much can we expect the liability to increase. Was that your question?\n\n---\n\nNo, it's with respect to the P&L charge for group net interest. I think you mention in the pension slide that, that -- the interest related to pension offset some of the increased service costs that you're guiding. Does that mean the overall net interest bill for the group that gets reported in '15 has maybe a slight decrease to it, assuming prevailing rates for the normal cash rates and income?\n\n---\n\nSo on the EBIT side, there's a slight increase in charges that we can expect from the changes in the level of the provisions and on the interest side, a slight decrease. So the net effect will be really very minor.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So that -- in terms of the group net interest I think for this year was around EUR 390 million on the P&L. Can we assume, all else equal, that, that can come down a little bit in reported terms in '15?\n\n---\n\nI think that would be a pretty good estimate of what the likely direction is.\n\n---\n\nTwo for me, actually. One on the free cash flow guidance. I can see that you're guiding for free cash flow covering the dividend payout, that would be EUR 1 billion. That is, I think, EUR 700 billion -- million below consensus. I was just wondering what the gap is -- or the explanation what the gap is. I can see that EUR 100 million -- there's EUR 100 million  more CapEx in 2015, also there will be some spillover from 2014 into 2015, but it still does not fully explain the gap. And then the second question, again, on the pension gap, given that the pension discount rate is still at 2.6%, I guess, that has to further decline going forward. And therefore, also the pension gap should increase further. How does that influence your thinking about any special returns to shareholders, given that this is also eating into your equity, please?\n\n---\n\nYes. So we'll maybe take the second question first. I think the accounting standard whereby our pension liability increases and decreases based on changes in the interest rate environment will actually have very little impact on any decision to make distributions to shareholders. We know that once we are coming out of this very unusual low interest rate environment that actually our equity is going to increase again and the liability quickly decrease, as we've seen happen in the opposite direction the last couple of years. So I think we'll -- we won't let that really influence the decision, but what will be important in terms of deciding whether or not to fund the pension further is the relationship that I talked about before, and the potentially accretive nature of additional funding, where the cost of funding is far less than the returns that we would expect on investing the funds. That was the calculation at the end of 2012. It worked out quite well in 2013 and 2014. So we think the potential is there, again, but no decision has been made yet. So in terms of our free cash flow guidance, of course, we've said at least cover, that means we could be somewhat higher. And the last couple of years, we've seen a really strong working capital performance. It probably, given the increase in volumes and revenues that we also expect, would be unrealistic to think that we can repeat that performance each and every year. So I think you mentioned that CapEx is up a bit, but so is our EBIT forecast. So on balance, we're pretty confident about the free cash flow forecast. But at this point, we don't want to say more than we're very confident we'll cover the increased dividend payout that we anticipate for May.\n\n---\n\nOkay, and maybe just one follow-up, I mean, given that your earnings are still increasing this year into your free cash flow guidance, as for a decline in free cash flow, that indicates that EBIT cash conversion is deteriorating and I think that cannot just be because of the slightly higher CapEx?\n\n---\n\nWell, we have not forecast declining free cash flow. We've only neglected to make it more precise other than to say we think it'll be more free cash flow generation that we need to cover the dividend. So we've had -- we haven't said that it will be less than last year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Well, thank you again. Now listen, to keeping in mind that busy schedule that we all have on a day like today, we have to come to an end with the Q&A session here. As always and with great pleasure, the IR team is looking forward to further talks and discussions with you out there. And with that, I'd like to hand over for closing remarks to Frank please.\n\n---\n\nYes, thank you for all your questions. We are convinced that we had a good year last year, and we kept our promises another year and delivered good results, which are a good base for the transition from what we call the first S curve of our strategy 2015 to the next S curve for 2020. 2015 will be a year where we change quite a lot, I think, in many parts. We are confident that we can execute that and lay a good foundation for then accelerated growth on top line and bottom line next year and the years to come. So therefore, I understand that there is some skepticism about what might happen. We believe that we have a very good master plan and as always, not everything works out as predicted, wherefore, other things are working out better than expected. I said that already last year, what has been better is that the Express delivered early in 2015. Supply Chain did actually pretty well, too. So I believe we will continue to see this year that there will be some things which are not making it up to what you expect and others might be better. And we are confident that the transformations we have in place are the right ones to make the company more successful on the long term. And this is what we have done over the last years, and we will continue to do so because we think that this is the right way to lead the organization into better profitability and more market share growth. And so that's what the major story has been. So again, thank you very much for your questions, your trust and see you soon in one way or the other. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThank you. Bye-bye.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Stephen Furlong (Analysts)】\nMaybe not surprisingly, can I just go to the Forwarding division. Maybe could you just give more detail where you see the time line there. Maybe how it's progressing by geography or by country in terms of pulling in the systems and the processes. And I'm assuming that the guidance for 2016 does assume some positive output and implementation from that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nYes. Let me take that question. So I think we are not ready yet to give you a more detailed outlook. I think we have, starting in November, December, after we stopped the rollout to China, I think we have said we have to learn more in-depth what is going on with the pilot countries. We are working intensively at the moment to really demonstrate that our pilot countries are back to normal and we are making good progress there. But I think we have learned a lot and therefore, we have changed approach -- the approach. We have 3 major work streams at the moment. One is that we want to understand how can we improve the system as such, what we have reflected in the system, by adding certain things and by de-complexing in certain areas. The second is we intensively are looking into the end-to-end processes to de-bottleneck because we figured out that we have some bottlenecks which are in the software. We have to solve that. And finally, we have learned as well from the pilot countries that preparation of the countries has to be different, and we are heavily looking into that. We thought it is more prudent to now really come to our conclusions out of what I've just outlined instead of talking about a new rollout plan, that it's better to say, let's learn what we have or let's debrief what we have learned and then create. So it will take some time still until we really can give you a new plan. That's the reason why it's also a little bit more challenging how much benefits we will see next year, and we will come back to that later when we know more how the rollout will be. But we are confident on the other side that the group guidance we have given is achievable, despite that we are changing here somehow the time line. And I think that's the best we can say at the moment. We are looking into that in depth, Roger and his team, and I think they found good root causes analysis and the consequences of that. But as I said, it's too early to give you a more detailed plan at the current stage.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stephen Furlong (Analysts)】\nAll right. That's fair. And if I could just have one quick follow-up. In terms of where the GP margins are in Ocean and Air Freight, do you think those declines are largely, let's say, market-related, is it certain verticals like the IT sector or it's, again, a function of the company being internally focused to some extent, clearly because of the importance of the project?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nI believe that it's several root causes. It's definitely market-driven. We are more exposed than others to big customers, to technology. But at the same time, there is no doubt that with the direction we have given the organization, we have distracted the organization from what they are good at. To be honest, we have not been as good in trading the day-to-day and the cycle of the market as we have been. And that is because people are working more on the transformation and preparation and data quality. If you tell sales people you have to bring contracts into the system, you can't be out to the customers and win new business while dealing with operational issues. And in hindsight, we probably underestimated a little bit how big the gap is where we are at the moment and where we have to be to use an SAP system. And that had impact on the day-to-day as well, despite that we are disadvantaged, but I think I would more say -- and that's probably different from what we have said before, the distraction of the management and the people is bigger than we thought in autumn last year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Damian Brewer (Analysts)】\n2 questions for me. First of all, on the Express business. Going back a couple of years, I remember sort of the '14, '15 period was going to be one of convergence, particularly as you brought all the countries onto similar sort of IT platforms and systems. Could you talk just a little bit more about where you are in that process, whether it's complete? And then given the investment in hubs, depots, airlifting capacity, whether you are now moving back to a more share-focused strategy and we go through that 3-year process again? And then secondly, more generally on the sort of the IT and the sort of standardization, industrialization of the business. As you go through this in the Express business, you still aim to get there in Forwarding and are going through it in the Supply Chain business, at what point does it start to make sense to start looking at bolt-on acquisitions once you've got the sort of scalability of platform to do those?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nYes, so let me answer with regard to the -- where we are with Express. I think we made great progress and the majority of all these things are done. The story never ends, to be honest. And I'm now on the IT board for all 3 years, I'm sharing that. And if you talk about IT, that story never ends. We -- Ken and his team is looking already to upgrading our functionality with many dimensions, be it billing or functionalities for digital features and so on and so forth. So I think, as we originally outlined, that is almost completed, and we are already -- and they are working already to upgrade our capabilities further, which is, of course, related to -- there is more international B2C and we have to find new answers. There are social media who are interacting differently than just call centers. So it will never stop. What originally was planned, I think, as I said, is almost done. And we are already in the progress of doing more in new things. And that's the reason why Ken has definitely the aspiration to close the gap to our biggest or strongest competitors even further. That's a journey we are on at the moment after we delivered a good margin already 1 year early. What is of extreme importance, and this is high on the priority list for Express, is service quality, service quality, service quality. We are -- have been so successful because we have done terrifically on that. So all the IT sides are looking from the service angle, do we need then to be better and more responsive to customers, and I think Ken has a very clear agenda of then doing that and he's demonstrated to do that, so I'm very optimistic with regard to that. All the standardizations are probably very unlikely to M&A because if I go through the different divisions, in Express, it's probably impossible to acquire somebody anyway. If I understand TNT's strategy, they want more focus on road anyway, which is not our core in Express. In Supply Chain, as I said, we have won almost half the business of the next competitors, while going through that, I think our key target has to be, we win on a standardized scalable operation, and we see that in some markets. We have great progress in China, for instance, with our business there. And that is based by rolling out good solutions of the very strong management. And in Forwarding, if we are through that, I think we can gain significant share from particular smaller and midsize forwarders. And so why acquiring them when we can grow organically. So I believe what we are doing is that we really want to make our business model more attractive, and that should bring us significant additional organic growth potential. And I can't see at the moment why any major add-on acquisition would make sense. So that's our prospective and has been for a while. We are well positioned. That makes me actually confident. The problems we face can be internally managed and are not dependent on strong growth or filling white spots and whatever. They do not make everything right always, that's normal as well. We are only human beings as well but they are controllable from us and that makes me confident that we are in a very good journey to 2020, even if sometimes the short term is more challenging than we thought.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nSo maybe let me take a shot at the question on the increased investments in hubs and airlift. I think it's much less a matter of a 3-year cycle than us investing in the success that we've had and that we anticipate in the Express business worldwide. When we opened Leipzig several years ago, it was sized for 3% growth per year. And we've been growing consistently at more than double that rate. So it's really investing in the great position and great success that we've had. Asia is another example. So despite having opened our second global hub in Asia, in Shanghai, 2 years ago, which then provided some relief for our Hong Kong hub, which was our first hub in Asia and was already full, we see the need to invest further in yet a third hub in Singapore, and we announced last week that we'd invest over EUR 100 million in Changi Airport in Singapore. So I don't think it relates to a cycle of investing and then reaping benefits and then somehow repeating every 3 years. I think it is a continuous upgrade process and success is just feeding on itself and as we're more successful, we'll invest as much as we need to, to maintain our -- and grow our leadership position.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jochen Rothenbacher (Analysts)】\nI have 2 questions. One on the guidance regarding FX effects. So the guidance for 2015 is based on what kind of U.S. dollar-euro relation, on the backdrop of the currently very depressed euro? And second, in this respect, at the rule of thumb, what does a decline in euro translate in EBIT improvement for you? And the second question is on the minimum wage in Germany. Could you explain which effects this has on you and especially on your suppliers? And in addition, what effect is there for your competitive landscape?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nMaybe, Larry, you answer question 1 and 2, and I'll talk about the minimum wage. So I think it's too early to judge. It has relatively modest impact on us because we, ourselves, employ people above the minimum wage anyway. Of course, we are working with subcontractors, particularly the trucking, and we will ensure that they are paying minimum wage. That is somehow funneling through because that's a common theme for everybody. So if we have a lift in cost across the board, and of course, our customers will look into that as well, that we are following the guidelines that our subcontractors were following. So it will probably lead to a slight price increase for the market, but that will be funneled through. In the mail business, in particular, where we have competition, of course, we paid less than that. We have to wait how that is really implemented and how the government really can follow what the people do. The challenge is not what they get paid per hour, the question is how many hours they work. And if you have couriers on the road, we can't send individuals behind couriers and check how many hours they work. And therefore, we expect not a fundamental change but it's up to the government to check what they are doing. Many of our competitors are working with subcontractors and small companies. They usually don't have workers' council. Their workers' council are best to check time, which has worked, but we will see. So it's too early to say, I believe, what the impact is. We have not anticipated significant positive impact. It means negative impact or cost increases for our competitors, yet in our guidance, we think that this has -- will have marginal impact on the market competition. So we are -- they are probably on the conservative side. We might be pleased during the year that this is implemented more than before and then we should have positive impact because it definitely will increase the cost base, in particular in the mail business for our competitors if it's applied correctly. But as I said, it's more the question how much that can be controlled. And therefore, let's wait and see. It's not embedded a major shift in the market in our numbers for PeP. So we -- there might be a positive surprise but it's too early to say.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nYes, so let me answer the questions on FX. The guidance that we've announced today is based on rates that are reasonably close to the current rates. And the interesting question is what does it mean for us. And the first thing to note is that in the dollar area, we have our exposure in income and expenses in U.S. dollars themselves. And then very significant exposures in other currencies that are closely related to the U.S. dollar, like the Chinese yuan, the Hong Kong dollar, the Singapore dollar and several others. If we take all of our income and expenses together, we're pretty well balanced in -- as the whole company in terms of U.S. dollars. So it doesn't make a big difference if the euro strengthens or weakens versus the U.S. dollar. Remember that fuel costs are driven by U.S. dollar pricing. So even fuel costs that we have in other currencies are directly influenced by U.S. dollar costs for energy. And so we have fairly significant expenses in -- for fuel in addition to very significant income on the U.S. dollar side, in total, as I said, it's pretty well balanced. So then the question is well, what about all the other currencies? The weaker euro for sure has a significant positive impact for some currencies. Those are namely the British pound and the Japanese yen, where we have net long positions. On the other hand, there's a few currencies where we have exposure where we -- where there's very significant weakness even against the euro like the Russian ruble, like some of the Latin American currencies. So with the current rate environment, there's neither a big advantage or a big disadvantage that we have from movements in currencies to their current levels.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Ross (Analysts)】\nA question on the Express division. Since you guys are a strong player in the Asia export market, did you see in the fourth quarter or are you seeing, I guess, currently here in the first quarter, any benefit from the West Coast ports congestion that's been going on in the U.S., in terms of additional Asia-U.S. air freight volumes?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nSo there, you don't mean the Express business, you mean our Forwarding business? So...\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Ross (Analysts)】\nActually in both.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nBoth. Okay. Yes, generally, we've seen good trends over the last couple of weeks and start of the year in Air Freight volumes. Whether -- how much of that is directly related to the West Coast port issue is very hard to say.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nYes, maybe to add, so in Express, it's probably marginal because people who are putting something on vessels on oceans will not change to Express tomorrow. On air freight, it had some impact on some routes, yes. And we have seen good volume growth not only there but overall. So it had positive impact on air freight, unfortunately on our bottom line number but on volume growth. So -- but in Express, it's very marginal. We had a very strong performance in Asia overall in Express. And it shows -- our development shows how well we are exposed to the interest -- most interesting markets in that industry anyways. So that had continued through but the impact on the port congestion was very limited on Express. Question answered, Dave?\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Ross (Analysts)】\nYes. And then another question just on Express. The yield side. Yields were down year-over-year in the quarter. Could you comment, I guess, Larry, on how much of that was lower fuel surcharges versus any mix issues? And then what kind of you're seeing in terms of core pricing in the market?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nYes. Virtually all of it had to do with the lower fuel costs and the lower fuel surcharges. There were other minor factors, but they netted pretty much to a breakeven in terms of yield development.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Ross (Analysts)】\nAnd then long term, is the goal at Express to have yields rise just to cover costs and then the margin expansion is going to come from growth in volumes? Or is there any effort to kind of push price to help with that margin expansion?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nSo I think the strategy in the last year has been right and we will continue. We will now win the game on service quality. And fortunately, we have gained significant market share on service quality. We will continue as a market leader to continuously increase prices but not in a way to make compromises on the growth potential. So our priority to grow the business back on service quality. There is scale still to gain through further growth and that's a strategy. And I think we have done that quite successfully in the past years. We will not now switch gears and say let's maximize now the yield. We believe we have to keep price increases and service quality and growth beyond the market in balance. And that is what the strategy has been in the last years and that has led to the success. So we will not compromise neither on service quality nor on growth just to maximize the short-term yield. Because I think we believe that's a dangerous game, we should not start that. The good news is the industry has behaved in the last years, very rational. None of the competitors really said, let's start a price war, whatsoever. They all understand that this will damage the industry, so we are really competing on service quality and we will not change it either. So that's where we are and we will continue to do so.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew O'Keeffe (Analysts)】\n2 questions for me, one on Parcels and one again on NFE. On Parcels, I wonder if you could say a little bit more about how buoyant the volumes were in Q4. I mean, you mentioned in the press release seasonal effects, but then listening to you now, it sounded like eCommerce and possibly structural factors were also at work. So I wonder if you're really doing yourself justice there. And the second question on the NFE, you've mentioned a couple of times its impact both in terms of direct and indirect costs. I guess I think I know what the indirect -- the direct costs are. Perhaps you could explain a little bit more about the indirect costs that you see arising from the NFE. That's it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nYes, so -- and Larry may take the first, I'll take the second. So in NFE, of course, we had also a more indirect expenses because the people are in training, we have expenses on training, people are -- because we have day-to-day business. We have added, of course, FTEs to that and that has, of course, impact on the bottom line. So yes, it's not only direct. That means we are not doing as good as we have done in trading but also we had higher indirect costs as well.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nSo yes. On the Parcel business, we had a very strong year-end season. If you go to Page 5 of the presentation, you see that growth in parcel volumes in Germany in Q4 was close to 8.5% compared to an average of 7% for the full year. So Q4 was a very strong quarter. We have seen that last year as well. And it's really due to the surge in eCommerce business and volumes that are happening around the Christmas season.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nMaybe one interesting observation which we probably have not shared but it's worth to mention. While we have seen differently, despite a tremendous growth, we have seen lower difference about the peak days and the normal days in December. So what happens actually, we -- it's too early to say that this is a trend. But currently, people are behaving more normal now in the eCommerce world than just saying, oh, that's a last minute gift I buy. You see that more in the retail. The last 4 weekends before Christmas, in Germany at least, are very strong sales days anyway. It's not just 1 Saturday, it's 4 Saturdays, and we see that kind of [ph] coming now as well, which is operationally easier to deal with. But it's too early to say that this will happen again. We have seen that this year that the maximum day was not as -- the strongest day was not so much different than other days in the month. And I think this is actually, for operational perspective, better, and it shows that eCommerce is not the last minute purchase, it becomes a normal habit, people just buy what they ever buy for gifts on an online -- in an online way. This is, on the other side, very promising because obviously, the attitude of people is changing even in that period. We have seen that already before. We never had a low season any longer. Usually summer is low season, but we have seen tremendous growth even in this period. And that's another indication that eCommerce is now reality and people are using that like they do shopping in the past. And that is good for us, and it's very promising for the midterm.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Angus Tweedie (Analysts)】\n2 from me. The first one is on DHL guidance for 2016. I mean, that clearly hasn't moved since the third quarter, but you're having greater difficulties restructuring your Freight Forwarding business. And we've also seen a small miss on consensus on the Express division in the fourth quarter. I mean, can you explain what leads to the -- how do we get to the improvement in 2016? Is that just the restructuring from Freight Forwarding falling off? Or are you expecting a pickup in Express as well? And then secondly, on provisions. They're up again year-on-year, can you give us some idea what's going to happen there in 2015 from a cash perspective?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nSo yes, the 2016 guidance, the primary drivers are, again, further improvement that we expect in the Express business. We do clearly expect that the Supply Chain business is going to be performing better than in 2015, also reflecting significant benefits from the restructuring that we're investing in this year. DGF, as Frank talked about before, it's still too early to give a very definitive forecast about it, but we're confident that altogether, we'll be well in the guidance range of EUR 2.45 billion to EUR 2.75 billion for DHL in total. So provisions, do you mean pension provisions or others?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Angus Tweedie (Analysts)】\nOthers.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nOkay. Because we had the EUR 2.1 billion increase in pension provisions, of course, related to the lower discount rate. Other provisions have not increased very substantially. So do you mean the impact of changes in provisions in cash flow for the year?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Angus Tweedie (Analysts)】\nYes. Exactly.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nOkay. There, we had a release of a very significant provision. The biggest part of that change, more than half of it, was the release of a provision that we originally built for cost of change in the Express restructuring that we did back in 2009. We determined by the middle of the year that we didn't need that provision anymore and we could release it. We did, at the same time, our write-down on increase or an accelerated depreciation of part of our air fleet for Express. So the net effect of that provision release and the write-off of remaining depreciation on some older parts of our air fleet, basically offset each other exactly. We discussed that as part of our Q2 reporting last year. And that was really the biggest driver of the provision impact on cash flow, remaining items were a number of smaller impacts.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nAngus, any further questions?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Angus Tweedie (Analysts)】\nYes, sorry, I mean, just on the guidance, though. So I mean, you seem unwilling to say that we should expect Global Freight Forwarding to necessarily pick up sharply. But then, you're looking for -- I suppose, what I'm saying, is Supply Chain going to be better than we'd expected, say, 3 months ago? And given Express is a little bit softer, are you expecting particular acceleration there into 2016 to make up the shortfall that we're now seeing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nMaybe on Express, before we get the wrong notion, so Express has done very well. We delivered in a year earlier. Don't make a judgment on a quarterly basis because, of course, there is phasing of AP&P, there are sometimes some extra costs, we are looking into that to improve performance. We are driven by long-term progress. And therefore, Ken has taken some actions to help our 2 year, this year's and next year's, numbers. We are looking into the overall achievement that we delivered there, 10% margin, 1 year earlier. So there is no reason to believe that we have a margin trend on a quarterly basis. Please take that not too seriously just by looking in the fourth quarter. The overarching trend is very healthy and as I said, we did some AP&P because we felt we had the headroom to do that, and we invested into the long-term success. Supply Chain had a better start last year than we expected under the new leadership. And we see nice progress there, too. We will have some investments this year as well in restructuring and optimization. So we looked into all of that before we reconfirmed the guidance, of course, knowing that we have not a final plan yet for this year and next year for the rollout of NFE. We feel very confident that we can make the margin next year. And of course, we are looking at that constantly. We would not say that if we were not confident that we have enough opportunities in our portfolio to make the numbers. So we stick to a  quantified guidance for the DHL divisions in total, but as you have seen, as a new element of our guidance policy if you like we've introduced a slide now also on what are the drivers on a divisional basis and I think that should be helpful enough.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Neil Glynn (Analysts)】\nIf I can ask 2 questions please. The first one, with respect to labor cost within PeP for 2015. With an upcoming deal to negotiate, how should we think about the level of labor cost inflation you're prepared for in 2015 and indeed beyond within PeP? And the second question, on cash flow, you've obviously -- Larry, you've obviously touched again the priorities for excess cash flow in the presentation. But it seems to remain somewhat elusive. It's been on the agenda for a few years now. So given the comments with respect to 2015 and 2016, is it fair to think now that 2016 is the -- or the end of 2016 is the earliest point at which we might see excess cash flow?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nYes, so let me start on labor cost. Of course, we are not believing that we will get -- walk away with 0 increase in salaries this year. So -- but I'm not too happy to share with all of you what we have put in the plan. And we are realistic as well. We have to find common ground. I think what is important is what we are doing at the moment by creating a new salary structure from the delivery subsidiaries is a long-term change of the game somehow. We have to reduce our cost base for new members. A lot of people are leaving due to retirement every year. And if we engage new people on a different level, we can't really make a difference until 2020. Of course, we expect that there will be demands this year for salary increases, and that's not surprising of course, that is embedded in our plan as well. And we will of course work as hard as possible to minimize that. We have not put in our guidance that we will have a 0 increase in salaries this year. So -- but beyond that, I hesitate to talk about that because the unions should not know what we have put into the numbers on that. And therefore, we are confident that we will make at least the EUR 1.3 billion this year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nYes. So let me take a crack at the cash flow question. Last year, we generated around EUR 600 million plus, more than we needed for the dividend last year, meaning 2013. This year, meaning 2014, it was around EUR 300 million plus. So we clearly have come to a point where decisions about our financial policy and which direction we want to go are getting much closer, it's much more of a current issue for us today than it was a couple of years ago. Nevertheless, it's a bit too early to say anything more concrete about which direction it's going to go or the exact timing other than to say it's much more of a current issue than it has been in the past.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andy Chu (Analysts)】\n3 questions from me, please. First one is just on NFE. I wonder if you could just remind us in terms of the number of countries that you've got to get around in terms of implementing air and sea SAP systems. I think the number is over 100 countries but I wonder if you can confirm the exact number of countries, please. Secondly, on your PeP guidance for at least -- or at least EUR 1.3 billion, which is what you've delivered in 2014. As Martin pointed out, Slide 30 shows some of the drivers, and the Parcels growth within PeP should only be partially offset by the traditional decline in mail volumes, which should drive PeP up. But given that you've got 2.3 more working days in 2015 versus 2014, which I guess, working off a rough rule of thumb of EUR 50 million per working day, that should probably drive up 9%. I was wondering if you could just comment on how you've arrived at that PeP guidance, please, of at least EUR 1.3 billion. And then maybe one for Larry in terms of pension funding. I think back in 2012, you were kind of at the sort of current net pension deficit levels where you took the decision at the end of 2012 to raise EUR 2 billion of bonds to put against pension plan assets. I wondered, given that we're back to where we are, given these sort of fall-in discount rates, what your thinking is around pensions, because you've obviously got no sort of mandatory requirement to do anything on pensions. But could it be a bond issue? Could that be some of the surplus cash that you talked about heading towards the pension part, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nOkay. Andy, let me answer the first question. So to be honest, I don't know exactly which, I think it's 89 but I can be perfectly wrong as well. So this is the range of countries where we control the business and it's sizeable enough that we will roll out that. As -- this is the same amount of countries where we have lodges [ph], which is the incumbent system rolled out, but to be honest, I think it's 89.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nIt's over 80.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nBut I'm not 100% sure.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nOver 80 countries.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nBut it's -- I think it's not 100. But Martin probably can figure that out. It's a clear list of countries. So just this is not my priority, is it 89 or 92. The challenge is more to get the right approach done. And then we will see. And the 90-ish countries is relatively small anyway.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nSo let me answer the last 2 questions. So now the PeP guidance for 2015. Yes, it's true, we have 2.3 more working days, though those days come at the very end of the year. And so it's hard to predict whether they will be -- will have the character of a normal additional working day, which as you said, Andy, as a kind of a rule of thumb, should add around EUR 50 million of revenues and earnings, or whether they'll be less important because of their timing. If they come between Christmas and New Years, it's hard to estimate what the effect of those could be. We've also been a bit cautious on PeP guidance, given the uncertainty on labor costs and where the negotiations are going to come out. Our current labor agreement is expiring at the end of May. And so, of course, we've made a prediction and built the prediction into our plan and therefore into the guidance. But it's, at the same time, hard to predict. So yes. So that's why the guidance for PeP is where it is, that we believe we'll do at least as well as last year. So in pension funding, I think one reason to think about more pension funding is because you're nervous about the amount of unfunded liabilities that you have. That is not the case with us. Nevertheless, we might think about doing additional pension funding for the same reasons that we did it in 2012. And that is that there's accretive effects on both EPS and on cash flow generation, depending on what your assumption is about the return on the invested assets. Given the extremely low costs of financing that are currently available, that is a tempting combination. And so we do have it on the table. We do think about it. We put it in the context of our whole financial policy, and we'll maybe have something more to say about that later in the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andy Chu (Analysts)】\nCould I just ask one -- just a small follow-up. On the -- within PeP, what percentage of your PeP employees are in these newly created subsidiaries and also, sort of running -- and therefore running at sort of lower wages than the historical -- than, I guess, the agreements, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nYes, currently, we have 4,000 and it probably will end up at 6,000 until the end of the year. So that's a progression, for the years, it will not change the game immediately. It is a journey, as I said earlier, until 2020.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Andy Chu (Analysts)】\nWas that 4,000 at the end of last year going to 6,000?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nYes, so 4,000 have already a new contract that shows that we offered an attractive package, otherwise people have not signed a contract, and we believe that we can increase that until the end of year to 6,000.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tobias Sittig (Analysts)】\nMaybe a bit of a harsh questions. But looking at Forwarding, I'm really a bit concerned. It feels like you're cutting costs on a platform that is falling apart a little bit. When I look at Air Freight a lot, just Air Freight forward in the world, when you lost 20% of your gross profit over the past 2 years. So I'd really like to have a little better understanding on why you're losing share or losing quality share. Why you have to make those price concessions. And when you think at least the decline in gross profit will be stopped, anything in terms of granularity there would really help.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nTobias, I think it is, as I said already, if -- this is a trading business, that means permanent attention on what you are buying and what you are selling. And if you have people on training and preparing organizations, they can't do both at the same time. And as I said already, we probably have underestimated how much attention it takes to move from A to B and how much distraction it takes from a day-to-day business, and that is what we see. The good news in all of that is this is a very fast-moving business. This is not heavy assets. It is you lose a customer and you gain a customer and that's all based on good service quality, service quality has in some places suffered as well because we are touching a lot of people and moving them around somehow. But not too much physically but what their responsibilities are. That has impact. What I think -- see about this, when I talk to the pilot countries and we are live in 5 countries and I have been in the pilot countries myself, the people are very excited about the visibility they get, the process they get, in particular, the younger people. But again, at the front, it is tough, because people lose attention, and in a trading business, you know that as well. Go to the stock market, it's a lot about attention. If you're not listening to all the things which are going on, you lose visibility. The good thing is you lose a customer, you can regain the customer as well because the industry is still not as professionalized as our Express business, where other competitors are delivering quite good service quality. So there, it's a very tight race. In Forwarding, I think, we have opportunities to recover from that. And as I said, we have underestimated the distraction people might get from the transformation. And we see now the results. So I think it is challenging. But it's not messy, I think, it's really -- we have to learn more consistently. If I talk to the employees in the pilot countries, they think that this is better than what they had. It's tough to grow from A to B but they think they can make it happen. And that makes me confident that we can make it happen even on a bigger scale.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Tobias Sittig (Analysts)】\nWhere do you stand in terms of the time line of that? Because we had the same discussion a year ago after Q1 and then you said you had some contract wins and it's been looking encouraging on the market side. And now it seems 12 years -- 12 months later, you're still sort of in the same distraction of the organization. So do you think that will continue throughout the year? Or should we see some stabilization on the gross profit side in the course of the year? How do you think about the gross profit side?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nSo to predict now exactly everything on that is -- as long as we have not a clear master plan in place, which we are working on currently, is a little bit difficult. 2015 will remain a challenging year without a doubt. And of course, that is embedded into our -- that is anticipated in our guidance we have given you today, that this will be a rough year for DGF without a doubt. And you are saying we said the same 12 months ago, one problem we have not done carefully enough, we have not debriefed the pilots sufficiently. We were more optimistic that depilation -- assimilation happens faster. And it didn't, and therefore, we said now, instead of going through additional pilots now in additional countries, you stop that until the pilot countries are really back to normal. And that has changed, you can say, why you have not done that 6 months earlier? Good question. The answer is because we probably underestimated the challenge. And that is better to admit that and change instead of keep going and say everything will be great tomorrow. I think the things are improving in the right direction. But it's more difficult and more challenging and there's tremendous attention on that. But I think it's better to say, listen, we don't have a new plan yet because we are working on that. Whomever I talk to internally and other people we have seen that, everybody feels encouraged what we are doing is right. The journey from A to B is more challenging.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Penelope Butcher (Analysts)】\nTwo quick questions from my side, just to clarify, on the Q4 metrics that you gave with respect to the geographic Express performance. It seems Americas, on the volume side in Q4, contracted quite significantly in terms of the rate of growth in TDI volumes. Could you explain if there was any specific issues around that as the other regions did seem to perform either in line with the run rates we had seen or in Europe's case, quite a bit better. And my second question is just in relation to when you speak about the pension, Larry, you did mention there would be some kind of offset adjustments to the increase in service costs at the interest line. Can you just give a bit of color on then how to think about the kind of net interest addition on full year 2015 in terms of the absolute amount we should be thinking about?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nSo yes, the Q4 volume performance in the Americas was driven by a couple factors. Important is our business with DoD and the overall reduction, the Department of Defense and the overall reduction in the level there as we continued to draw down in various engagements, as the U.S. Department of Defense draws down its various engagements around the world. So we had lower volumes with the DoD. Another was Venezuela, where we saw lower volumes associated with the extreme weakness in the Venezuelan economy. Pensions, if I understood your question correctly, it's how much can we expect the liability to increase. Was that your question?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Penelope Butcher (Analysts)】\nNo, it's with respect to the P&L charge for group net interest. I think you mention in the pension slide that, that -- the interest related to pension offset some of the increased service costs that you're guiding. Does that mean the overall net interest bill for the group that gets reported in '15 has maybe a slight decrease to it, assuming prevailing rates for the normal cash rates and income?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nSo on the EBIT side, there's a slight increase in charges that we can expect from the changes in the level of the provisions and on the interest side, a slight decrease. So the net effect will be really very minor.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Penelope Butcher (Analysts)】\nOkay. So that -- in terms of the group net interest I think for this year was around EUR 390 million on the P&L. Can we assume, all else equal, that, that can come down a little bit in reported terms in '15?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nI think that would be a pretty good estimate of what the likely direction is.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Johannes Braun (Analysts)】\nTwo for me, actually. One on the free cash flow guidance. I can see that you're guiding for free cash flow covering the dividend payout, that would be EUR 1 billion. That is, I think, EUR 700 billion -- million below consensus. I was just wondering what the gap is -- or the explanation what the gap is. I can see that EUR 100 million -- there's EUR 100 million  more CapEx in 2015, also there will be some spillover from 2014 into 2015, but it still does not fully explain the gap. And then the second question, again, on the pension gap, given that the pension discount rate is still at 2.6%, I guess, that has to further decline going forward. And therefore, also the pension gap should increase further. How does that influence your thinking about any special returns to shareholders, given that this is also eating into your equity, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nYes. So we'll maybe take the second question first. I think the accounting standard whereby our pension liability increases and decreases based on changes in the interest rate environment will actually have very little impact on any decision to make distributions to shareholders. We know that once we are coming out of this very unusual low interest rate environment that actually our equity is going to increase again and the liability quickly decrease, as we've seen happen in the opposite direction the last couple of years. So I think we'll -- we won't let that really influence the decision, but what will be important in terms of deciding whether or not to fund the pension further is the relationship that I talked about before, and the potentially accretive nature of additional funding, where the cost of funding is far less than the returns that we would expect on investing the funds. That was the calculation at the end of 2012. It worked out quite well in 2013 and 2014. So we think the potential is there, again, but no decision has been made yet. So in terms of our free cash flow guidance, of course, we've said at least cover, that means we could be somewhat higher. And the last couple of years, we've seen a really strong working capital performance. It probably, given the increase in volumes and revenues that we also expect, would be unrealistic to think that we can repeat that performance each and every year. So I think you mentioned that CapEx is up a bit, but so is our EBIT forecast. So on balance, we're pretty confident about the free cash flow forecast. But at this point, we don't want to say more than we're very confident we'll cover the increased dividend payout that we anticipate for May.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Johannes Braun (Analysts)】\nOkay, and maybe just one follow-up, I mean, given that your earnings are still increasing this year into your free cash flow guidance, as for a decline in free cash flow, that indicates that EBIT cash conversion is deteriorating and I think that cannot just be because of the slightly higher CapEx?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nWell, we have not forecast declining free cash flow. We've only neglected to make it more precise other than to say we think it'll be more free cash flow generation that we need to cover the dividend. So we've had -- we haven't said that it will be less than last year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Martin Ziegenbalg (Executives)】\nOkay. Well, thank you again. Now listen, to keeping in mind that busy schedule that we all have on a day like today, we have to come to an end with the Q&A session here. As always and with great pleasure, the IR team is looking forward to further talks and discussions with you out there. And with that, I'd like to hand over for closing remarks to Frank please.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Frank Appel (Executives)】\nYes, thank you for all your questions. We are convinced that we had a good year last year, and we kept our promises another year and delivered good results, which are a good base for the transition from what we call the first S curve of our strategy 2015 to the next S curve for 2020. 2015 will be a year where we change quite a lot, I think, in many parts. We are confident that we can execute that and lay a good foundation for then accelerated growth on top line and bottom line next year and the years to come. So therefore, I understand that there is some skepticism about what might happen. We believe that we have a very good master plan and as always, not everything works out as predicted, wherefore, other things are working out better than expected. I said that already last year, what has been better is that the Express delivered early in 2015. Supply Chain did actually pretty well, too. So I believe we will continue to see this year that there will be some things which are not making it up to what you expect and others might be better. And we are confident that the transformations we have in place are the right ones to make the company more successful on the long term. And this is what we have done over the last years, and we will continue to do so because we think that this is the right way to lead the organization into better profitability and more market share growth. And so that's what the major story has been. So again, thank you very much for your questions, your trust and see you soon in one way or the other. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Lawrence Rosen (Executives)】\nThank you. Bye-bye.",

First, I'd like to focus on the key developments of the fiscal year 2014, followed by an update on where we stand in terms of the execution of our strategy in 2016. Then Carsten will provide you with the financials in detail of the full year and how we created shareholder value in 2014. And after that, I will close my presentation with a brief summary for 2014 and the outlook for '15, and finally, we will be happy to take your questions.\r\nI'd like to begin by reminding everyone that the presentation, which contains the usual formal disclaimer to forward-looking statements within the meaning of relevant U.S. legislation, can be accessed via our website at henkel.com/ir. The presentation discussions are conducted subject to the disclaimer. We will not read the disclaimer, but propose we take it as read into the records for the purpose of this conference call.\r\nAnd now let's get started. We have 4 items: key developments '14; strategy progress for '16; financials '14; and extended value creation and the end summary and outlook for FY '15. And then, we'll go to the Q&A session.\r\nAlthough it was a rough -- robust performance in a challenging volatile environment, we grew our organic sales growth by 3.4%. Our adjusted EBIT margin hit an all-time high of 15.8%, adjusted earnings per share growth of 7.6%. Our free cash flow came in at EUR 1.3 billion. We invested EUR 1.8 billion in acquisitions, and our dividend payout is proposed to save 30%, but of course, with an increase relative to the earnings per share growth. We'll look at the further details on that later on.\r\nSo how do we perform against guidance? We guided our organic sales growth between 3% and 5%. We came in within the range, but the lower part of the range at 3.4%. On the emerging market sales, we expected a slight increase in nominal sales and we ended up at prior level. I don't want to stress at this point in time that we had an exceptionally strong year when we take the emerging markets condition as consideration. We grew high single-digit, and we're very happy with our overall performance in our emerging markets. The only deviation to the slight increase is currency driven. There's nothing organic that is below our expectation. Our adjusted EBIT margin, we guided at just under 16% and we came in at 15.8%. And our adjusted EPS growth, we guided high single-digit, defined as 7% to 9%. Following the second quarter, we made a revision within the range and said we'll be closer to 7% than 9%, we came out at 7.6%. We're pretty much in the middle of the range, but within -- clearly within the range of our guidance.\r\nNow let me describe how we saw the year. We see a consistent execution on our 2016 strategy, so we are doing the things we said we would do under our 4 strategic priorities and executing that very diligently.\r\nWe have conducted a high-quality set of acquisitions that will strengthen our market position in the short, as well as in the long-term. Very much in the core of what we're doing -- they're -- very market-wise, very attractive, and we believe, possesses very little risk and attractive from an earnings standpoint.\r\nWe saw a solid organic sales growth, driven by all business. And we continue to see very strong organic sales growth in the emerging markets. Carsten will speak later about that, but this is an area we are very satisfied with.\r\nOur adjusted EBIT margin hit an all-time high, driven by all business groups. And our adjusted EPS growth came in at a high-single digit. As I said, that will mean a further increase in dividend, assuming the payout ratio of 30% will be approved by the AGM, which will take place in approximately 6 weeks from now.\r\nThere are also areas that we are less concerned about. There are some macro areas, there are some  micro areas and there are some which are self-inflicted. On the macro side, we have clearly had substantial FX headwind, particularly in the first half of 2014, pretty much until August and that is now being ongoing since '13 until mid-'14. We continue to see severe geopolitical and social unrest in some of the countries we conduct business in, particularly Middle East, and despite that, we continue to deliver very strong performance, but of course, has an impact on the overall growth rate.\r\nWe are seeing the Eastern European economy being impacted by the Russian and Ukraine crisis. Ukraine and Russia is, of course, impacted. And as I've stated very clearly in every quarterly call in 2014, we are seeing a slowdown in the Eastern European economy because of this political situation.\r\nOn the macro side -- on the micro side, we've seen a further intensified price and promotion pressure on the HPC market in most markets across the board, which is an unfortunate development of the HPC market. And as I've also been clear on similar calls, North America has been clearly below our expectations in 2014. We have undertaken significant changes to ensure that that won't happen again. And we'll see when we start with pulling the numbers in '15, how that will come about. But clearly, North America was below expectations, particularly when we look upon the overall upside that economy represents.\r\nLet me move to Laundry & Home Care. We've seen, inside our organic sales growth in the past year, Laundry being solid and Homecare and some more of the specialty categories, being very strong. The mature markets, we saw Western Europe being solid despite a not very exciting economy in Western Europe and North America being negative. The emerging markets continued its double-digit growth rate in 2014. We saw adjusted EBIT margin showing a very strong increase throughout the year and ROCE was below the level of previous yeas because of number of onetime items that Carsten will be commenting on more in detail.\r\nWe also are seeing a continuous strength in our innovation pipeline. Approximately, 45% of our business in this area is done by products that has been introduced in the last 3 years. And our innovation helped us differentiate in the marketplace and also take pricing in the marketplace. That has helped to drive the top line but also the improvement on the bottom line. Vernel, which is one product I'd like to mention here, is where you're starting to see some of the trends from the Beauty Care market segments coming in to the Laundry & Home Care segments. And here, you're seeing the inclusion of oils within a detergent-related products. As you know, oils were introduced, particularly in hair products, approximately 2 to 3 years ago. A very exciting product, we patented the build of materials and the way the product has been constructed. It is implemented in a set of countries in the fourth quarter and will be fully implemented in Western and Eastern Europe by the third quarter of 2015.\r\nOn the Beauty Care side, we saw a more solid organic sales growth. Retail was solid. Hair Salon was negative -- was positive in the fourth quarter but I do not want to make any final judgments on whether the market has finally turned. On the mature markets, Western Europe continued to be positive with similar comments as I gave in the Laundry & Home Care side in North America, also here disappointing.\r\nEmerging markets continued to be strong. China, double-digit. Just to remind everybody, we are not present in China in Laundry & Home Care, which is why I didn't say -- I didn't comment on China in Laundry & Home Care. The adjusted EBIT margin continued to show solid increase and ROCE will be below previous years or it is below previous years for the same reasons as stated in Laundry & Home Care, which Carsten will comment on.\r\nAlso in this area, 45% of our sales is conducted by products which have been introduced in the last 3 years. And in 2014, we introduced Schwarzkopf Essence ULTÎME, which is a high-end hair product serials [ph]. It is noncomparable to Syoss. I want to be very clear on this. So where Syoss is a volume product, this is a high-end product with a very different margin portfolio and incremental to the market shares that we're gaining here, because in this market segment, we've not been present before. So we're very excited about the introduction of this product and it's gone according to plan in 2014.\r\nNow let me move to our biggest business group, Adhesive Technologies, where we saw a solid OSG and solid adjusted EBIT margin improvements in 2014. We saw, as I said, all -- solid organic sales growth in all businesses growing, particularly what we call our General Industry, our Loctite business, was very strong in 2014. In the mature markets, again, a similar picture, Western Europe positive, North America negative and the emerging markets are strong, China double-digit, also in the fourth quarter. We saw the adjusted EBIT margins showing solid increase, an all-time high, and also ROCE further increased.\r\nWhen it comes to our Adhesive Technology. Particularly, technology in this space, it helps us differentiate in the marketplace and drive pricing, actually, into the market place, which has been part of the reason why we've been able to take the market from 10% to above 17% in the past 6 years. In this area, we have approximately 30% of our business being conducted with products that have less than 5 years in the marketplace. This is a different factor, because simply some of the products that we introduced that customers do not want us to change them over a longer period of time. I speak about Automotive, where you have a life cycle of a car of 7 years; or Aerospace, where it's of course longer. So that's where you simply cannot change the product as quickly as in other areas simply because of the customer requirements.\r\nOne of the areas that are quite exciting is our overall Surface Treatment business, where in the past we've only delivered products. Now with some of our new products, we're also delivering total solution, so i.e., also making certain that the product is being applied to the customer product. In this area, we've had some very exciting wins, particularly in the separate [ph] markets, where we're not only delivering the product but also conducting the application of the product to the customer product. So a much more solution-driven business, which is very much in line with what we're trying to do, deliver differentiation through technology and application know-how.\r\nThat was, in highlight, how 2014 went. Now let me just review where we are in our strategy execution towards 2016. We all know our strategy built around outperform, globalize, simplify and inspire, and our 3 financial targets, 20-10-10, where our 10% EPS CAGR is our primary target towards 2016 and the one where we made substantial progress.\r\nIt's clear that we then made the progress under EUR 20 billion sales so far, simply because of one item, headwinds in currency. We expect that to change in 2015 and make a substantial step forward, but that has been the primary reason for the lack of progress on the 20. As I said, our primary guidance value is the 10% EPS CAGR.\r\nOn outperform, we are conducting a number of activities, which will continue to help us make us more competitive. On our top brands, our top 3 brands today account for EUR 5 billion and our top 10 brands from 59% of our total sales. A couple of years ago, one of the criticisms around Henkel was, we don't have any strong brands. As you can see, our top 10 brands, which account for 60% of our business, almost have a average of EUR 1 billion a piece. And that, of course, allows us to spend much more focus on marketing spend because we have fewer brands to spend on.\r\nOn innovation, I've spoken about that. It is helping us drive differentiation and it's helping, of course, drive pricing into the marketplace. And we are seeing an increase in the innovation rate across all businesses.\r\nOn our R&D centers, we stated that we would open up 7 new R&D centers in the emerging countries by 2016. We have so far opened up 5 and 2 to go, and we're very confident that we will also open up the remaining 2 and we'll report separately on that when we've done so far. But overall, we are building the infrastructure, consolidating our brands and driving innovation that will allow us to continue to what we're trying to do, grow profitably towards our 2016 targets.\r\nOn globalize, we are focusing on regions with high potentials. And this is where mature and emerging markets play 2 different roles. In the mature markets, we want to consolidate our strong market positions and increase leveraging to profitability. And we will invest to drive efficiency into this area, so we expect slower growth rates but higher profitability. We are seeing that particularly in Europe in 2014, which was an exceptionally good year.\r\nOn the emerging markets, they need to continue to drive our top line growth for the future, and of course, also over time, increase profitability. In order to do so, we are investing heavily in our emerging markets. And for the first year ever, the total amount of CapEx investments were now 50-50 between mature markets and emerging markets. So we are clearly investing for the future in the emerging markets, whether it's manufacturing, processes, systems or people.\r\nWe've also spent EUR 1.8 billion in acquisitions to strengthen our core business, moving forward. We've done, I would say, EUR 3.5 billion or EUR 4 billion on our Laundry & Home Care business. We acquired a number of brands in our core business, Laundry Additives and Insecticides in Europe to strengthen our core position in Laundry, but also it now put us into a #2 position in Insecticides in Europe. We have a strong position in the U.S., and we are market leader in Korea. And in the beginning of the year, we acquired the brand E! in Poland to strengthen our Laundry position in Poland. In our Beauty Care business, we acquired 3 brands in the U.S., which make us now #3 in the professional haircare market in the U.S. I just want to remind everybody, by 2010, we had a 0 position in the U.S. and right now, we are #3 in the U.S., so a very strong position in attractive marketplace. And in our Adhesive business, we acquired the Bergquist Company, the leader in thermal management systems, so the distribution of heat generated by processors in the electronics industry. The electronics industry can be consumer electronics, of course, business electronics or automotive or aerospace. This will help expand our position in the overall electronics market, which is very attractive, not only from a growth standpoint but also from a profitability standpoint. So we believe, we have invested actively in very attractive acquisitions, with very attractive P&Ls that will help the company moving forward, not only towards 2016 but also beyond.\r\nOn simplify, making us a better company, so driving a much more scalable business model, we now have more than 2,600 people in shared service centers. And this year, we opened Cairo and Shanghai, so we're now present globally in shared services. And we're confident towards moving towards the target of having more than 3,000 people working in shared services by 2016. We converted 45,000 employees to a new digital platform in 2014 without any disruption. We finalized the rollout of SAP horizon in Asia and are now starting to -- starting the implementation work in Europe without any business disruption, which is not self-explanatory. A lot of companies are suffering in this area. We had a very successful rollout.\r\nAnd we created our global supply chain company, set up in Amsterdam. And we're looking for further sourcing hubs for the future that will allow our global supply chain to operate more efficiently. Overall, we are building a scalable business model.\r\nBut most importantly, we'll continue to strengthen our global management team. There is no doubt that the core reason why we've been able to consistently improve our performance has been through good and solid execution done globally by good leadership. And we are working effectively with Harvard Business School to ensure that our top 200 leaders are trained by trainers, so to speak, a co-development program between Henkel and Harvard that ensures that our senior leaders across the company knows what is expected from them from a cultural standpoint, but also from a performance standpoint. We are a performance-driven company.\r\nOn talent and performance. We continue to conduct our, what we call, Development Round Table, where we're steckling [ph] our people to ensure that we treat people fairly but differently. We want to make sure that the top performers get top attention within our company and performance is recognized. And that allows us also to promote more than 1,000 people internally. Internal promotion is a high priority for us under the assumption that the performance is appropriate and the compliance to our values is in order.\r\nDiversity, the last point. 33% of our managers are women, but even more important, we have a global work force. We have today, in our top managers, Chinese, Arabs, Russians, Americans, Latin Americans, and that is what truly characterizes a global company. We do not want to be a global-managed company. We are a global company, globally headquartered in Germany, but we want to have a global management team. And we made substantial progress on this, where in most regions, the regions are run by strong local leaders.\r\nNow I'd like to hand over to Carsten, who will take us through the financials in detail for 2014. Carsten, please?\n\n---\n\nThank you very much, Kasper. Good morning to everyone. Let's have a now look on our financials for the full year 2014 in more detail. And let's start, as always, with an overview of our key performance indicators and starting here with our sales performance. In 2014, our sales accounted for EUR 16,428,000,000. This is showing a slight increase in nominal terms of 40 basis points due to negative FX effect amounting to 4.0%. Organically, we could increase, again with a solid organic net sales growth, our numbers by 3.4%, supported by all our 3 business divisions.\r\nOur gross margin -- adjusted gross margin came in at 47.5%. This is 50 basis points below the prior year with 48.0%. So with the growth gross margin of 48%, the year 2013 represented a tough and high comparable. If you would compare the 47.5% to the year 2012, this would represent an increase of 40 basis points.\r\nComing now to our adjusted EBIT margin. Our adjusted EBIT margin could be increased for the year 2014 by 40 basis points, now to an all-time high in terms of margin of 15.8%, and by that, representing a strong result, supported by all 3 business divisions.\r\nBefore I now continue with the EPS, let me step back for a moment and comment on the Q4 adjusted EBIT margin of the quarter. This is below the prior year of 60 basis points and there are 3 major reasons behind: first of all, I think you all know that we acquired significantly in the year 2014 and the closing of the majority of the acquisition was in the second half, being more precise even in the quarter 4 of the year. And by that, you can imagine that we have taken integration costs but also inventory step-ups, which are related to IFRS [ph] requirements into -- directly into account, which affected the Q4 2014. But also to be clear, these are onetime effects, which will not occur going into 2015. The second reason behind is the crisis, which you're also aware, in Russia and Ukraine. Besides the translational impact which we face, we have also significant transactional impacts in Russia and in Ukraine hitting our gross margin and by that also hitting our EBIT, and by that, impacting also the margin. And the third point is, we have increased our marketing spend in our fast-moving consumer businesses on a quarter-to-quarter comparison Q4 to Q4 of last year. So these are the 3 main reasons why you see a 60 basis point decline in the Q4 margins. Especially the number, the second reason which I alluded to, the situation in Russia and Ukraine, is something which is not a onetime effect, which will continue definitely also, which we will see in the first half of the year 2015 because the crisis started in the second half of 2014.\r\nWith that, let me come back with the experts [ph] and come now to our adjusted EPS, development of our preferred shares, we reached EUR 4.38, which is an increase of 7.6%, and by that, hitting our high single-digit guidance for EPS in the year 2014, even if it is at the lower end of the range as we indicated it already in Q3 release. So overall, a robust performance and another year of profitable growth.\r\nLet me now come to our cash situation, and here, focusing first on our net working capital development. Net working capital came in at a good level of 4.2%, which is up versus the prior year of 190 basis points, but definitely as a -- on a satisfying level. Please consider, also here, the topic of the recent acquisitions which we did, they have not the same level of net working capital as we are used to, so this has an impact of roughly 70 basis points. And on top, we are also attributable to negative currency effects of roughly 50 basis points. If you add these 2 components, it's 120 basis points. And if you see that, then you would have a like-for-like comparison of roughly 3.0% of net working capital. And if I could remind you on what I said last year, we see our net working capital on a level between 3% and 3.5%. That's the reason why we see this number of 4.2% on the satisfying level for 2014. Nevertheless, we will not give up to further improve net working capital also in the coming years.\r\nComing now to our free cash flow development. We reached the free cash flow of EUR 1,333,000,000, which is in line with the average over the last 6 years, which we take as a reference period since 2008. For sure, this is below the previous year with EUR 1.6 billion, which was an all-time high when it comes to free cash flow.\r\nWith that, let me move now to our net financial position. The net financial position at the end of 2014 reached a level of minus EUR 153 million considering the increased dividend payout, which we had in 2014 and the recent acquisitions of EUR 1.8 billion, which we spent. A remarkable result. So we used also here our cash in a very disciplined way.\r\nAfter this overview, let me now go into the details of the KPIs and starting with our sales situation. As I mentioned before, our sales came in organically with a solid development of 3.4% for the year, and this is split by 40 basis points of price increases or price development and 300 basis points of volume development.\r\nAs anticipated, in 2014, we continued to face a headwind with foreign exchange with 400 basis point, as I mentioned before, the absolute amount is, in that terms, EUR 650 million, and especially, decreasing or depreciation of emerging market currency contributed the majority of that part. And even be more precise, Russia and Ukraine, these 2 countries amount for 1/3 of this EUR 650 million of FX effect.\r\nM&A. The net effect of M&A contributed plus 1.0%. So in total, we reached EUR 16,428,000,000, showing a slight nominal increase as pointed out before of 40 basis points.\r\nHaving now a look on our situation in the emerging markets and the mature markets. You heard already Kasper pointing that out. We were -- have been very satisfied with our development in the emerging markets. We could, again, show a strong organic net sales growth of 7.8%, reaching EUR 7,249,000,000 in absolute terms. And also, our situation in the mature markets was slightly positive with 0.2%, especially with a very satisfying performance in Western Europe.\r\nThe emerging markets now account for 44% of our total sales, despite the FX headwinds. This is a stable situation compared to the prior year. If we would adjust for FX, so for the same level as of last year, we would have increased the emerging market level to 46%.\r\nWith that, I would like to now go into the details of the region and give you a glance of how we have been developing here. And first of all, overall statement, all regions show organic growth besides or except North America. Starting with Western Europe. Western Europe in total amounts for 35% of our total sales. And as you can see, we have increased organically the situation by 1.7%. This is, as I said before, supported by a very good performance in Germany across all business units. But it's also noteworthy to mention that also, in Southern Europe, all major countries showing positive developments besides one country, which is Italy. Italy is still negative in terms of organic net sales development.\r\nComing now to Eastern Europe. Similar to Q3, we see a counterintuitively sales development in Eastern Europe. Eastern Europe is amounting for 70% -- 17% of our sales and we have a polarized situation. We have, in total, an organic net sales growth of 4.5% by Russia, showing a very strong development in terms of organic development, while Ukraine and some other countries are negative.\r\nMoving now to Africa/Middle East. Africa/Middle East, again, in 2014 showed a double-digit development plus 16.9% in terms of organic net sales and development. Coming now to North America, amounting for 18% of our sales. Organic sales remained below the prior year. Our consumer businesses, Laundry & Home Care and Beauty Care, were both impacted by an intense, promotional and price competition, but also our execution was also not always optimal, and by that, impacting our business negatively. The situation in our Adhesive Technology business in North America is different. Here, we are affected by portfolio optimization measures. That means we are deemphasizing our commoditized businesses, especially in the area of packaging -- adhesive packaging and consumer goods.\r\nWith that, I would like to move to Latin America. Latin America amounts for 6% of our total sales, shows solid development in organic net sales growth of 4.4%, with a strong development in Mexico and a flat development in Brazil, especially impacted by the weak development of the market.\r\nFinally, Asia-Pacific. Again, also here, a very strong sales performance, plus 8.2% in terms of organic terms and this was especially driven, as Kasper has pointed it out before, by a double-digit development in China, but also strong development of India.\r\nWith that -- well, let me finalize the situation in terms of commenting on our BRIC situation. I have done it more or less by summarizing it. BRIC, a very good development, double-digit in China, very strong in Russia and India, and the only one was flat is Brazil.\r\nWith that, I would like to move to our 3 divisions, and starting now with Laundry & Home Care. Laundry & Home Care amounts for 28% of our total sales of the company, showed an organic growth of 4.6%, driven by volume of 5.1%, and by that, overcompensating a negative pricing effect of 50 basis points. And the 2 businesses, Kasper mentioned it, Laundry showed a solid organic net sales growth while the Home Care business were very strong in terms of growing organically.\r\nThe emerging market, again, in 2014, showed double-digit development with Eastern Europe and a solid development, while Asia-Pacific and Latin America both were very strong, and Africa/Middle East in a double-digit development.\r\nMature markets remained below the prior year. We had a good development in Western Europe, supported by a good development of Germany, but that could not fully compensate the situation you're aware of in North America where we have a negative development due to a fierce promotional environment and on top of declining markets in 2014.\r\nBottom line situation. Adjusted EBIT margin, again, could be increased by 60 basis points on a full year basis now to a level of 16.2%, this is an all-time high. Also if we give you now a longer perspective, since 2008, we have improved the adjusted EBIT margin in Laundry & Home Care by 450 basis points since 2012. This development shows an increase of 240 basis points.\r\nFinalizing the situation in Laundry & Home Care with a look on net working capital. We show, here also, a very good number of minus 6.6%. This is above the prior year of 140 basis points. But if you consider, also here, the M&A effect, which amounts to 70 basis points, we are quite satisfied with the development also on that level.\r\nMoving now to Beauty Care. Beauty Care now showed a 9th year of consecutive profitable growth, showing an organic net sales growth of 2.0%, driven exclusively by volume, so the price component was flat. The retail business showed a solid organic net sales growth and our Hair Salon business is still characterized by a market decline in the mature markets. And as you know, the mature markets are the majority of our sales, so sales therefore showed a negative development. But also commenting again on that, as Kasper said it, the Q4 of professional was positive in terms of OSG.\r\nThe emerging market grew strongly with a double-digit contribution in the emerging Asia region and here with a double-digit development of China. Africa/Middle East and Latin America showed growth -- strong growth rates. Mature markets could not be maintained on the prior year level. We have a similar situation, like in Laundry, we have a very good development in our Western European countries, which could not fully compensate the situation in North America with a similar reason as pointed out in Laundry & Home Care.\r\nComing also now to the bottom line of Beauty Care. We have seen an increase of our adjusted EBIT margin in 2014 of 30 basis points bringing us to a level of 15.3%. Also here, the comparison on a long-term basis, since 2008, we increased the margin by 270 basis points, or respectively, since 2012 of 80 basis points.\r\nNet working capital is, also here, on a very good level of 1.3%, being up 180 basis points. Here are 2 effects, which are remarkable on the one side also, the FX from acquisitions, which amount to 80 basis points, but here, we have also a fixed FX of roughly 60 basis points, so in total, 140 basis points on a -- to make it like-for-like.\r\nWith that, moving now to our Adhesive Technology division. And also stating here, we have 49% of our sales in the total group which are amounting -- or representable for Adhesives, we have seen a solid organic net sales growth of 3.7%, which are a balanced mix of volume and price. To be precise, 270 basis points is volume, 100 basis points is price.\r\nAll segments contributed to that development, especially General Industry segment showed a strong -- or very strong organic net sales growth. All other segments had a solid development when it comes to OSG.\r\nEmerging markets, especially here, a strong development with Russia and China being double-digit, but also strong developments from Mexico and India. Mature markets recorded a positive organic net sales growth, here again, the strong development or a good development in Western Europe and mature Asia could overcompensate the slight negative development in North America.\r\nBottom line, adjusted EBIT margin is up 30 basis points to an all-time high level of 17.2%. And if you also look here, historically back, we have increased since 2008, 710 basis points, the adjusted EBIT margin in Adhesives, and since 2012 of 210 basis points.\r\nNet working capital is at the level of 12.2%, also here, impacted by FX and acquisition. FX amounts for 60 basis points -- sorry, acquisition amounts for 60 basis points while FX amounts for 90, so in total, 150 basis points in order to come to a like-for-like comparison so there we would be up only 70 basis points. So very satisfied also here with net working capital.\r\nWith that, I move -- would like to move further in our income statement adjustment and starting with gross margins or from sales to gross margins. I have commented on the sales development of EUR 16.428 million. We have a gross profit of EUR 7,798,000,000, which is down compared to the prior year of minus 0.8%. That brings our margin to 50 basis points reduction compared to the prior year. I already commented on, that the prior year was a high comparable and that we are 50 basis points down, but compared to 2012, we are 40 basis points up. So especially here, increase in our raw material costs as one item and also the high promotional intensity could -- were affecting our 2014 numbers and we could not overcompensate that by good cost development measures and efficiency gains, which we realized in our supply chain area.\r\nWith that, moving to our -- further in our income statement adjusted now from gross profit to EBIT. You see marketing, selling and distribution expenses decreased in percentage of sales, especially to efficiency gains realized in selling and distribution expenses. After the adjustment for foreign exchange effects, we kept our absolute marketing spend for a full year. Stable, take into account that we have a number -- significant reduced number of brands, which we support as Kasper is pointing that out. So less than 300 brands, we have now in our portfolio. And on top, we spent more efficiently and strong -- and therefore strongly supporting our key brands.\r\nOverall, our clear strategy is to grow sales, increase market shares and have margins increasing. And this is the balanced why how we steer and how we develop the situation when it comes to the mix of advertising and the market conditions related to promotions.\r\nR&D expenses are at the level of 2.5% related to sales and are almost on the level of 2013. Administration expenses in absolute terms are down by 2%. With strict cost discipline and efficiency focus behind, the percentage of sales remains on the level of the year before. We have operating -- other operating income -- other operating expense balance of EUR 36 million, which is a very low level, and by that, we reached an adjusted EBIT of EUR 2,588,000,000 or a respective margin of 15.8%, which I commented before on.\r\nWith that, I would like to move now to our bridge from reported to adjusted EBIT. You see onetime gains of EUR 28 million. We have onetime charges of EUR 159 million. I would like to comment on 2 specific topics here: first, as already commented in Q3, we have been negatively impacted by expenses of EUR 100 million -- EUR 109 million for provisions related to proceedings by Anti-Trust Authorities in Europe and the proceedings are related to violations occurred between the years 2003 and 2006, so more than 10 years below; secondly, we have charges related to the setup of our global supply chain setup, the integrated global supply chain company, which were amounting of roughly EUR 40 million.\r\nMoving to our expenses regarding restructuring, in total EUR 230 million, which is above the prior year, but which is in line with the guidance we have given to you at the beginning of 2014.\r\nWith that, we come to the EUR 2.588 billion I just mentioned before in terms of adjusted EBIT for 2014.\r\nLooking at the bottom line, profit expansion is ensured in a tough environment. Why do I come to that conclusion? If you see the financial results, EUR 49 million of negative, which is an improvement of 56% or EUR 64 million compared to the prior year, and we paid taxes on income of EUR 533 million, which is related to an effective tax rate at 24%, also here in line what we, in general, see for the year and therefore we come with a net income of EUR 1,662,000,000.\r\nClosing the financials. Looking at the net financial situation, you see the minus EUR 153 million, I commented on, and there are 3 topics to be mentioned: first, we invested roughly at EUR 1.8 billion in acquisitions, which you are aware of; secondly, we paid dividends of around EUR 550 million, which is EUR 100 million more than the comparable year 2013; and we also invested more into PPE and intangible assets, roughly EUR 500 million, also EUR 100 million more than the year before.\r\nWith that, we still -- taking our A-flat rating into account, we have a financial headroom of roughly EUR 4 billion to EUR 4.5 billion. And taking a step back over the last years, you see that we have improved the situation by EUR 3.6 billion.\r\nWith that, I'm moving now to the excellence in value creation and taking 3 steps: one, on organic performance; second, on acquisitions; and third, on cash return options.\r\nLet me start with the organic performance. We are seeing a situation that we increased our capital expenditures by 19% now to a level of EUR 517 million compared to EUR 230 million, this is in line within our guidance. We significantly increased the share of investments in our emerging markets, as you can see from the chart, plus 30%. And thereof, we are spending now 1/2 of the group capital expenditures in the emerging markets and for sure then, the other 1/2 in the mature markets. The investments are focused on expansion and optimization projects, 2/3 of that. And we also, as pointed out several times before, significantly increased our investments in our IT infrastructure, which brings me to the next point because we would like to further build on our scalable business model, where IT investments are one of the major focus areas. We are focusing on best-in-class processes, IT focus and global supply chain. I will not spend so much on shared services because Kasper has already done that. We significantly increased the number of people already now to a level of more than 2,600 and we are well ahead of our plan to reach the 3,000 people, which we have foreseen for the end of 2016. And we finalized our global footprint with opening 2 shared service centers in Cairo and Shanghai.\r\nWith the IT platform, we would like to further consolidate. We are doing the second initiatives by consolidating our IT systems. We executed that in Asia. We reduced the number of ERP systems from 21 to 1 system, which is fully in operation in -- since 2014, and we started to roll out, as the majority of the rollout in Europe will start in 2015, in order to continue the execution what we have done in Asia.\r\nAnd finally, coming to our global supply chain company. Here, we have completed the blueprint. It is about further milestone in standardization and harmonization and process optimization of our processes. We would like to have an integrated setup of our global supply chain organizations of the 3 business divisions, including our purchasing activities. And we have established, at the end of 2014, our supply company in Amsterdam. And we will continue to work on these over the next years.\r\nWith that, moving to our acquisitions, a very disciplined and focused approach. Also with execution measures in 2014, EUR 1.8 billion, we spent in acquisitions on all our 3 business divisions, and by that, further strengthening our positions in attractive segments in Laundry & Home Care. Besides the brand E! in Poland, we had the major acquisition of the Spotless Group, which has a purchase price -- or an enterprise value of EUR 940 million. In the Beauty Care area, despite the acquisition of Pert in Latin America, we acquired the 3 professional hair care businesses in North America, where we spent EUR 274 million. And in Adhesive Technologies, we acquired the Bergquist company at the end of the year. And here, a clear point, where we would like to further gain technological leadership in growing markets of the electronic industry and we spent EUR 467 million on that.\r\nGoing forward, we remain committed to the acquisitions. And we will continue our disciplined and very focused approach, where we definitely have our criteria, which have not changed. That means strategic fit, financial attractiveness and availability of targets and then we will also correspondingly execute.\r\nThe last pillar, our cash return options. As already mentioned, this year, again, we will propose at the Annual General Meeting, 13th of April, that we will propose a dividend payout of roughly 30% of our adjusted net income after controlling interests. And this is in line with our change of our dividend policy, which we disclosed last year from 25% to a range of 25% to 35%. If you look on our further -- on our dividend, you'll see the 25% over the last years and in '13 and '14, the 30%, which will bring us to a dividend of EUR 131 million for the preferred shares, being up more than 7% -- 7.4%. And this translates into a total amount of dividend of EUR 569 million, and by that, an increase of EUR 40 million to the year before.\r\nWith that, I'm at the end and would like to hand back over to Kasper.\n\n---\n\nThank you very much, Carsten. Coming to the end, let me just comment on chances and opportunities in our global market, because the question I've been asked very frequently when I met with many of you in 2014. And I have chosen to comment on our 4 largest countries in the world: U.S., Germany, China and Russia. And that is the sequence of the stack. The U.S. clearly represents a huge opportunity for us moving forward. We have invested heavily in the U.S. market in 2014, not only in OpEx but also on CapEx. I mentioned in my presentation and Carsten detailed about the acquisitions we have done to not only strengthen, but also expand our position in the U.S. And clearly, we've not executed up to par. We will do that and you can rely on that. We are very, very committed to make sure that the U.S. will get back to its role within the organization as the biggest country, which is already, but also as a revenue contributor and as a EBIT gross contributor.\r\nGermany, you have to win your home games, and we have done that in the past several years also in 2014. Germany was an exceptionally good year for us in 2014, not only in terms of growth but also EBIT expansion and market share expansion. We will continue to defend and grow our home turf.\r\nChina, a lot of people have been concerned about the growth rates in China from a GDP standpoint, going to 7% or 7.2% outlook for 2015, which is very similar, by the way, to the GDP number in '14. I've been consistently, almost in the last 4 to 5 years, been asked about when do we see the slowdown in China. Of course, there is a economic slowdown. Despite that, we continue to grow double-digit in China, and China is an over proportionally profitable market for us. We also, as you know, invest ahead of time. We have 16 plants, building the 17th. We are expanding our footprint when it comes to offices, when it comes to people. We will continue to expand in China, and we continue to be bullish around China.\r\nRussia. Russia is -- or was our fourth largest country in the world, has been an exceptional success story for Henkel, and we grew very rapidly also in the past year. Of course, in nominal terms, we have been heavily impacted by the ruble. But I do want to remind all of you when I have said this in one-to-one meetings, this is the fourth crisis we're experiencing in Russia. Our experiences have been by sticking in Russia and staying the course, we have, in the long term, strengthened our market share position, and that is our position in Russia. Russia will, in the short to medium-term, be a challenge for us, but in the long term a huge opportunity. We have no change in our Russia strategy.\r\nMoving to 2014. It was overall a robust performance in a challenging and volatile environment. We delivered our key financial indicators in 2014 despite challenging markets, with very strong adverse currency. We strengthened our portfolio with high-quality assets, predominantly in mature countries, which might represent a lesser growth opportunity, but are very strong from an earnings opportunity. And with the U.S. position, I'm certain that we are not only strategically but also tactically improved our position in the U.S. We saw a solid organic sales growth driven all -- by all business groups. We saw very strong organic sales growth in the emerging markets at 7.8%, which is almost similar to previous years, despite the Russian crisis, despite the war in the Middle East, et cetera. And we saw an all-time high of our EBIT margin in high single-digit EPS growth. It is another, what we call, successful year towards our 2016 targets that we've set ourselves and we are very committed to.\r\nWe see 2015 as an ongoing challenging business environment. We expect a moderate pick-up in global GDP. According to Farrow, GDP grew 2.2% last year and it's supposed to grow 2.8% this year, so there should be an upside. We saw -- we'll see a high volatility in some key currency and crude oil prices. Some will deliver upside, dollar and dollar pegged, and also the raw materials and some will deliver a downside. And we see a persistent geopolitical change, mainly in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East.\r\nAnd now, let me say something which is extremely important, so let me try to be clear on this. As you know, Russia and Ukraine together account for about 7% of Group sales -- at Group sales level. Even if we move production, we are facing stong FX headwinds. Based on the current FX rate levels, which is pretty consistent in the last month, which is why I say current, we expect a transactional and translational impact of around EUR 100 million, negative on Group EBIT for 2015 for Russia and Ukraine together, meaning a decline over '14 of approximately EUR 100 million.\r\nPlease remember also that our total direct materials in Russia and Ukraine are highly dependent on currency movement as a large part is either sourced in euro or U.S. dollar or linked to those currencies. What I do want to stress, and that's why I'm clear, what I've just said is included in the guidance. So the EUR 100 million in Russia and in Ukraine is included in the 10% EPS guidance.\r\nMoving forward, we'll have a focused and balanced investment to foster organic and inorganic growth. We have a clear North American road map, and concrete initiatives has been underway and will show results. We have a strong innovation pipeline. At the same time, we will continue our cost focus and make sure that we adapt our structure to the market, also moving forward.\r\nAnd this leaves me now to the guidance. We expect organic sales growth of 3% to 5%, and Laundry & Home Care and Adhesives being in the same range, Beauty Care at 2%. Emerging market sales at prior level due to predominantly currency, and adjusted EBIT market around 16%. We expect an adjusted EPS growth of 10%, including what I just said about Russia and Ukraine. So I want to be very, very clear, so we don't misunderstand that, that is included in the guidance.\r\nWith this, I'm coming to the end of the presentation. We have our AGM in April. We have our first quarter numbers in May and we have our Investor Conference. And this year, it'll be with focus on Laundry & Home Care. It'll take place in Dusseldorf.\r\nAnd now, we have approximately 10 to 15 minutes -- no, 7 minutes to Q&A. So please, now switch to Q&A.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Kasper Rorsted (Executives)】\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen, here from Dusseldorf, and welcome to our conference call. First, I'd like to focus on the key developments of the fiscal year 2014, followed by an update on where we stand in terms of the execution of our strategy in 2016. Then Carsten will provide you with the financials in detail of the full year and how we created shareholder value in 2014. And after that, I will close my presentation with a brief summary for 2014 and the outlook for '15, and finally, we will be happy to take your questions.\r\nI'd like to begin by reminding everyone that the presentation, which contains the usual formal disclaimer to forward-looking statements within the meaning of relevant U.S. legislation, can be accessed via our website at henkel.com/ir. The presentation discussions are conducted subject to the disclaimer. We will not read the disclaimer, but propose we take it as read into the records for the purpose of this conference call.\r\nAnd now let's get started. We have 4 items: key developments '14; strategy progress for '16; financials '14; and extended value creation and the end summary and outlook for FY '15. And then, we'll go to the Q&A session.\r\nAlthough it was a rough -- robust performance in a challenging volatile environment, we grew our organic sales growth by 3.4%. Our adjusted EBIT margin hit an all-time high of 15.8%, adjusted earnings per share growth of 7.6%. Our free cash flow came in at EUR 1.3 billion. We invested EUR 1.8 billion in acquisitions, and our dividend payout is proposed to save 30%, but of course, with an increase relative to the earnings per share growth. We'll look at the further details on that later on.\r\nSo how do we perform against guidance? We guided our organic sales growth between 3% and 5%. We came in within the range, but the lower part of the range at 3.4%. On the emerging market sales, we expected a slight increase in nominal sales and we ended up at prior level. I don't want to stress at this point in time that we had an exceptionally strong year when we take the emerging markets condition as consideration. We grew high single-digit, and we're very happy with our overall performance in our emerging markets. The only deviation to the slight increase is currency driven. There's nothing organic that is below our expectation. Our adjusted EBIT margin, we guided at just under 16% and we came in at 15.8%. And our adjusted EPS growth, we guided high single-digit, defined as 7% to 9%. Following the second quarter, we made a revision within the range and said we'll be closer to 7% than 9%, we came out at 7.6%. We're pretty much in the middle of the range, but within -- clearly within the range of our guidance.\r\nNow let me describe how we saw the year. We see a consistent execution on our 2016 strategy, so we are doing the things we said we would do under our 4 strategic priorities and executing that very diligently.\r\nWe have conducted a high-quality set of acquisitions that will strengthen our market position in the short, as well as in the long-term. Very much in the core of what we're doing -- they're -- very market-wise, very attractive, and we believe, possesses very little risk and attractive from an earnings standpoint.\r\nWe saw a solid organic sales growth, driven by all business. And we continue to see very strong organic sales growth in the emerging markets. Carsten will speak later about that, but this is an area we are very satisfied with.\r\nOur adjusted EBIT margin hit an all-time high, driven by all business groups. And our adjusted EPS growth came in at a high-single digit. As I said, that will mean a further increase in dividend, assuming the payout ratio of 30% will be approved by the AGM, which will take place in approximately 6 weeks from now.\r\nThere are also areas that we are less concerned about. There are some macro areas, there are some  micro areas and there are some which are self-inflicted. On the macro side, we have clearly had substantial FX headwind, particularly in the first half of 2014, pretty much until August and that is now being ongoing since '13 until mid-'14. We continue to see severe geopolitical and social unrest in some of the countries we conduct business in, particularly Middle East, and despite that, we continue to deliver very strong performance, but of course, has an impact on the overall growth rate.\r\nWe are seeing the Eastern European economy being impacted by the Russian and Ukraine crisis. Ukraine and Russia is, of course, impacted. And as I've stated very clearly in every quarterly call in 2014, we are seeing a slowdown in the Eastern European economy because of this political situation.\r\nOn the macro side -- on the micro side, we've seen a further intensified price and promotion pressure on the HPC market in most markets across the board, which is an unfortunate development of the HPC market. And as I've also been clear on similar calls, North America has been clearly below our expectations in 2014. We have undertaken significant changes to ensure that that won't happen again. And we'll see when we start with pulling the numbers in '15, how that will come about. But clearly, North America was below expectations, particularly when we look upon the overall upside that economy represents.\r\nLet me move to Laundry & Home Care. We've seen, inside our organic sales growth in the past year, Laundry being solid and Homecare and some more of the specialty categories, being very strong. The mature markets, we saw Western Europe being solid despite a not very exciting economy in Western Europe and North America being negative. The emerging markets continued its double-digit growth rate in 2014. We saw adjusted EBIT margin showing a very strong increase throughout the year and ROCE was below the level of previous yeas because of number of onetime items that Carsten will be commenting on more in detail.\r\nWe also are seeing a continuous strength in our innovation pipeline. Approximately, 45% of our business in this area is done by products that has been introduced in the last 3 years. And our innovation helped us differentiate in the marketplace and also take pricing in the marketplace. That has helped to drive the top line but also the improvement on the bottom line. Vernel, which is one product I'd like to mention here, is where you're starting to see some of the trends from the Beauty Care market segments coming in to the Laundry & Home Care segments. And here, you're seeing the inclusion of oils within a detergent-related products. As you know, oils were introduced, particularly in hair products, approximately 2 to 3 years ago. A very exciting product, we patented the build of materials and the way the product has been constructed. It is implemented in a set of countries in the fourth quarter and will be fully implemented in Western and Eastern Europe by the third quarter of 2015.\r\nOn the Beauty Care side, we saw a more solid organic sales growth. Retail was solid. Hair Salon was negative -- was positive in the fourth quarter but I do not want to make any final judgments on whether the market has finally turned. On the mature markets, Western Europe continued to be positive with similar comments as I gave in the Laundry & Home Care side in North America, also here disappointing.\r\nEmerging markets continued to be strong. China, double-digit. Just to remind everybody, we are not present in China in Laundry & Home Care, which is why I didn't say -- I didn't comment on China in Laundry & Home Care. The adjusted EBIT margin continued to show solid increase and ROCE will be below previous years or it is below previous years for the same reasons as stated in Laundry & Home Care, which Carsten will comment on.\r\nAlso in this area, 45% of our sales is conducted by products which have been introduced in the last 3 years. And in 2014, we introduced Schwarzkopf Essence ULTÎME, which is a high-end hair product serials [ph]. It is noncomparable to Syoss. I want to be very clear on this. So where Syoss is a volume product, this is a high-end product with a very different margin portfolio and incremental to the market shares that we're gaining here, because in this market segment, we've not been present before. So we're very excited about the introduction of this product and it's gone according to plan in 2014.\r\nNow let me move to our biggest business group, Adhesive Technologies, where we saw a solid OSG and solid adjusted EBIT margin improvements in 2014. We saw, as I said, all -- solid organic sales growth in all businesses growing, particularly what we call our General Industry, our Loctite business, was very strong in 2014. In the mature markets, again, a similar picture, Western Europe positive, North America negative and the emerging markets are strong, China double-digit, also in the fourth quarter. We saw the adjusted EBIT margins showing solid increase, an all-time high, and also ROCE further increased.\r\nWhen it comes to our Adhesive Technology. Particularly, technology in this space, it helps us differentiate in the marketplace and drive pricing, actually, into the market place, which has been part of the reason why we've been able to take the market from 10% to above 17% in the past 6 years. In this area, we have approximately 30% of our business being conducted with products that have less than 5 years in the marketplace. This is a different factor, because simply some of the products that we introduced that customers do not want us to change them over a longer period of time. I speak about Automotive, where you have a life cycle of a car of 7 years; or Aerospace, where it's of course longer. So that's where you simply cannot change the product as quickly as in other areas simply because of the customer requirements.\r\nOne of the areas that are quite exciting is our overall Surface Treatment business, where in the past we've only delivered products. Now with some of our new products, we're also delivering total solution, so i.e., also making certain that the product is being applied to the customer product. In this area, we've had some very exciting wins, particularly in the separate [ph] markets, where we're not only delivering the product but also conducting the application of the product to the customer product. So a much more solution-driven business, which is very much in line with what we're trying to do, deliver differentiation through technology and application know-how.\r\nThat was, in highlight, how 2014 went. Now let me just review where we are in our strategy execution towards 2016. We all know our strategy built around outperform, globalize, simplify and inspire, and our 3 financial targets, 20-10-10, where our 10% EPS CAGR is our primary target towards 2016 and the one where we made substantial progress.\r\nIt's clear that we then made the progress under EUR 20 billion sales so far, simply because of one item, headwinds in currency. We expect that to change in 2015 and make a substantial step forward, but that has been the primary reason for the lack of progress on the 20. As I said, our primary guidance value is the 10% EPS CAGR.\r\nOn outperform, we are conducting a number of activities, which will continue to help us make us more competitive. On our top brands, our top 3 brands today account for EUR 5 billion and our top 10 brands from 59% of our total sales. A couple of years ago, one of the criticisms around Henkel was, we don't have any strong brands. As you can see, our top 10 brands, which account for 60% of our business, almost have a average of EUR 1 billion a piece. And that, of course, allows us to spend much more focus on marketing spend because we have fewer brands to spend on.\r\nOn innovation, I've spoken about that. It is helping us drive differentiation and it's helping, of course, drive pricing into the marketplace. And we are seeing an increase in the innovation rate across all businesses.\r\nOn our R&D centers, we stated that we would open up 7 new R&D centers in the emerging countries by 2016. We have so far opened up 5 and 2 to go, and we're very confident that we will also open up the remaining 2 and we'll report separately on that when we've done so far. But overall, we are building the infrastructure, consolidating our brands and driving innovation that will allow us to continue to what we're trying to do, grow profitably towards our 2016 targets.\r\nOn globalize, we are focusing on regions with high potentials. And this is where mature and emerging markets play 2 different roles. In the mature markets, we want to consolidate our strong market positions and increase leveraging to profitability. And we will invest to drive efficiency into this area, so we expect slower growth rates but higher profitability. We are seeing that particularly in Europe in 2014, which was an exceptionally good year.\r\nOn the emerging markets, they need to continue to drive our top line growth for the future, and of course, also over time, increase profitability. In order to do so, we are investing heavily in our emerging markets. And for the first year ever, the total amount of CapEx investments were now 50-50 between mature markets and emerging markets. So we are clearly investing for the future in the emerging markets, whether it's manufacturing, processes, systems or people.\r\nWe've also spent EUR 1.8 billion in acquisitions to strengthen our core business, moving forward. We've done, I would say, EUR 3.5 billion or EUR 4 billion on our Laundry & Home Care business. We acquired a number of brands in our core business, Laundry Additives and Insecticides in Europe to strengthen our core position in Laundry, but also it now put us into a #2 position in Insecticides in Europe. We have a strong position in the U.S., and we are market leader in Korea. And in the beginning of the year, we acquired the brand E! in Poland to strengthen our Laundry position in Poland. In our Beauty Care business, we acquired 3 brands in the U.S., which make us now #3 in the professional haircare market in the U.S. I just want to remind everybody, by 2010, we had a 0 position in the U.S. and right now, we are #3 in the U.S., so a very strong position in attractive marketplace. And in our Adhesive business, we acquired the Bergquist Company, the leader in thermal management systems, so the distribution of heat generated by processors in the electronics industry. The electronics industry can be consumer electronics, of course, business electronics or automotive or aerospace. This will help expand our position in the overall electronics market, which is very attractive, not only from a growth standpoint but also from a profitability standpoint. So we believe, we have invested actively in very attractive acquisitions, with very attractive P&Ls that will help the company moving forward, not only towards 2016 but also beyond.\r\nOn simplify, making us a better company, so driving a much more scalable business model, we now have more than 2,600 people in shared service centers. And this year, we opened Cairo and Shanghai, so we're now present globally in shared services. And we're confident towards moving towards the target of having more than 3,000 people working in shared services by 2016. We converted 45,000 employees to a new digital platform in 2014 without any disruption. We finalized the rollout of SAP horizon in Asia and are now starting to -- starting the implementation work in Europe without any business disruption, which is not self-explanatory. A lot of companies are suffering in this area. We had a very successful rollout.\r\nAnd we created our global supply chain company, set up in Amsterdam. And we're looking for further sourcing hubs for the future that will allow our global supply chain to operate more efficiently. Overall, we are building a scalable business model.\r\nBut most importantly, we'll continue to strengthen our global management team. There is no doubt that the core reason why we've been able to consistently improve our performance has been through good and solid execution done globally by good leadership. And we are working effectively with Harvard Business School to ensure that our top 200 leaders are trained by trainers, so to speak, a co-development program between Henkel and Harvard that ensures that our senior leaders across the company knows what is expected from them from a cultural standpoint, but also from a performance standpoint. We are a performance-driven company.\r\nOn talent and performance. We continue to conduct our, what we call, Development Round Table, where we're steckling [ph] our people to ensure that we treat people fairly but differently. We want to make sure that the top performers get top attention within our company and performance is recognized. And that allows us also to promote more than 1,000 people internally. Internal promotion is a high priority for us under the assumption that the performance is appropriate and the compliance to our values is in order.\r\nDiversity, the last point. 33% of our managers are women, but even more important, we have a global work force. We have today, in our top managers, Chinese, Arabs, Russians, Americans, Latin Americans, and that is what truly characterizes a global company. We do not want to be a global-managed company. We are a global company, globally headquartered in Germany, but we want to have a global management team. And we made substantial progress on this, where in most regions, the regions are run by strong local leaders.\r\nNow I'd like to hand over to Carsten, who will take us through the financials in detail for 2014. Carsten, please?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Carsten Knobel (Executives)】\nThank you very much, Kasper. Good morning to everyone. Let's have a now look on our financials for the full year 2014 in more detail. And let's start, as always, with an overview of our key performance indicators and starting here with our sales performance. In 2014, our sales accounted for EUR 16,428,000,000. This is showing a slight increase in nominal terms of 40 basis points due to negative FX effect amounting to 4.0%. Organically, we could increase, again with a solid organic net sales growth, our numbers by 3.4%, supported by all our 3 business divisions.\r\nOur gross margin -- adjusted gross margin came in at 47.5%. This is 50 basis points below the prior year with 48.0%. So with the growth gross margin of 48%, the year 2013 represented a tough and high comparable. If you would compare the 47.5% to the year 2012, this would represent an increase of 40 basis points.\r\nComing now to our adjusted EBIT margin. Our adjusted EBIT margin could be increased for the year 2014 by 40 basis points, now to an all-time high in terms of margin of 15.8%, and by that, representing a strong result, supported by all 3 business divisions.\r\nBefore I now continue with the EPS, let me step back for a moment and comment on the Q4 adjusted EBIT margin of the quarter. This is below the prior year of 60 basis points and there are 3 major reasons behind: first of all, I think you all know that we acquired significantly in the year 2014 and the closing of the majority of the acquisition was in the second half, being more precise even in the quarter 4 of the year. And by that, you can imagine that we have taken integration costs but also inventory step-ups, which are related to IFRS [ph] requirements into -- directly into account, which affected the Q4 2014. But also to be clear, these are onetime effects, which will not occur going into 2015. The second reason behind is the crisis, which you're also aware, in Russia and Ukraine. Besides the translational impact which we face, we have also significant transactional impacts in Russia and in Ukraine hitting our gross margin and by that also hitting our EBIT, and by that, impacting also the margin. And the third point is, we have increased our marketing spend in our fast-moving consumer businesses on a quarter-to-quarter comparison Q4 to Q4 of last year. So these are the 3 main reasons why you see a 60 basis point decline in the Q4 margins. Especially the number, the second reason which I alluded to, the situation in Russia and Ukraine, is something which is not a onetime effect, which will continue definitely also, which we will see in the first half of the year 2015 because the crisis started in the second half of 2014.\r\nWith that, let me come back with the experts [ph] and come now to our adjusted EPS, development of our preferred shares, we reached EUR 4.38, which is an increase of 7.6%, and by that, hitting our high single-digit guidance for EPS in the year 2014, even if it is at the lower end of the range as we indicated it already in Q3 release. So overall, a robust performance and another year of profitable growth.\r\nLet me now come to our cash situation, and here, focusing first on our net working capital development. Net working capital came in at a good level of 4.2%, which is up versus the prior year of 190 basis points, but definitely as a -- on a satisfying level. Please consider, also here, the topic of the recent acquisitions which we did, they have not the same level of net working capital as we are used to, so this has an impact of roughly 70 basis points. And on top, we are also attributable to negative currency effects of roughly 50 basis points. If you add these 2 components, it's 120 basis points. And if you see that, then you would have a like-for-like comparison of roughly 3.0% of net working capital. And if I could remind you on what I said last year, we see our net working capital on a level between 3% and 3.5%. That's the reason why we see this number of 4.2% on the satisfying level for 2014. Nevertheless, we will not give up to further improve net working capital also in the coming years.\r\nComing now to our free cash flow development. We reached the free cash flow of EUR 1,333,000,000, which is in line with the average over the last 6 years, which we take as a reference period since 2008. For sure, this is below the previous year with EUR 1.6 billion, which was an all-time high when it comes to free cash flow.\r\nWith that, let me move now to our net financial position. The net financial position at the end of 2014 reached a level of minus EUR 153 million considering the increased dividend payout, which we had in 2014 and the recent acquisitions of EUR 1.8 billion, which we spent. A remarkable result. So we used also here our cash in a very disciplined way.\r\nAfter this overview, let me now go into the details of the KPIs and starting with our sales situation. As I mentioned before, our sales came in organically with a solid development of 3.4% for the year, and this is split by 40 basis points of price increases or price development and 300 basis points of volume development.\r\nAs anticipated, in 2014, we continued to face a headwind with foreign exchange with 400 basis point, as I mentioned before, the absolute amount is, in that terms, EUR 650 million, and especially, decreasing or depreciation of emerging market currency contributed the majority of that part. And even be more precise, Russia and Ukraine, these 2 countries amount for 1/3 of this EUR 650 million of FX effect.\r\nM&A. The net effect of M&A contributed plus 1.0%. So in total, we reached EUR 16,428,000,000, showing a slight nominal increase as pointed out before of 40 basis points.\r\nHaving now a look on our situation in the emerging markets and the mature markets. You heard already Kasper pointing that out. We were -- have been very satisfied with our development in the emerging markets. We could, again, show a strong organic net sales growth of 7.8%, reaching EUR 7,249,000,000 in absolute terms. And also, our situation in the mature markets was slightly positive with 0.2%, especially with a very satisfying performance in Western Europe.\r\nThe emerging markets now account for 44% of our total sales, despite the FX headwinds. This is a stable situation compared to the prior year. If we would adjust for FX, so for the same level as of last year, we would have increased the emerging market level to 46%.\r\nWith that, I would like to now go into the details of the region and give you a glance of how we have been developing here. And first of all, overall statement, all regions show organic growth besides or except North America. Starting with Western Europe. Western Europe in total amounts for 35% of our total sales. And as you can see, we have increased organically the situation by 1.7%. This is, as I said before, supported by a very good performance in Germany across all business units. But it's also noteworthy to mention that also, in Southern Europe, all major countries showing positive developments besides one country, which is Italy. Italy is still negative in terms of organic net sales development.\r\nComing now to Eastern Europe. Similar to Q3, we see a counterintuitively sales development in Eastern Europe. Eastern Europe is amounting for 70% -- 17% of our sales and we have a polarized situation. We have, in total, an organic net sales growth of 4.5% by Russia, showing a very strong development in terms of organic development, while Ukraine and some other countries are negative.\r\nMoving now to Africa/Middle East. Africa/Middle East, again, in 2014 showed a double-digit development plus 16.9% in terms of organic net sales and development. Coming now to North America, amounting for 18% of our sales. Organic sales remained below the prior year. Our consumer businesses, Laundry & Home Care and Beauty Care, were both impacted by an intense, promotional and price competition, but also our execution was also not always optimal, and by that, impacting our business negatively. The situation in our Adhesive Technology business in North America is different. Here, we are affected by portfolio optimization measures. That means we are deemphasizing our commoditized businesses, especially in the area of packaging -- adhesive packaging and consumer goods.\r\nWith that, I would like to move to Latin America. Latin America amounts for 6% of our total sales, shows solid development in organic net sales growth of 4.4%, with a strong development in Mexico and a flat development in Brazil, especially impacted by the weak development of the market.\r\nFinally, Asia-Pacific. Again, also here, a very strong sales performance, plus 8.2% in terms of organic terms and this was especially driven, as Kasper has pointed it out before, by a double-digit development in China, but also strong development of India.\r\nWith that -- well, let me finalize the situation in terms of commenting on our BRIC situation. I have done it more or less by summarizing it. BRIC, a very good development, double-digit in China, very strong in Russia and India, and the only one was flat is Brazil.\r\nWith that, I would like to move to our 3 divisions, and starting now with Laundry & Home Care. Laundry & Home Care amounts for 28% of our total sales of the company, showed an organic growth of 4.6%, driven by volume of 5.1%, and by that, overcompensating a negative pricing effect of 50 basis points. And the 2 businesses, Kasper mentioned it, Laundry showed a solid organic net sales growth while the Home Care business were very strong in terms of growing organically.\r\nThe emerging market, again, in 2014, showed double-digit development with Eastern Europe and a solid development, while Asia-Pacific and Latin America both were very strong, and Africa/Middle East in a double-digit development.\r\nMature markets remained below the prior year. We had a good development in Western Europe, supported by a good development of Germany, but that could not fully compensate the situation you're aware of in North America where we have a negative development due to a fierce promotional environment and on top of declining markets in 2014.\r\nBottom line situation. Adjusted EBIT margin, again, could be increased by 60 basis points on a full year basis now to a level of 16.2%, this is an all-time high. Also if we give you now a longer perspective, since 2008, we have improved the adjusted EBIT margin in Laundry & Home Care by 450 basis points since 2012. This development shows an increase of 240 basis points.\r\nFinalizing the situation in Laundry & Home Care with a look on net working capital. We show, here also, a very good number of minus 6.6%. This is above the prior year of 140 basis points. But if you consider, also here, the M&A effect, which amounts to 70 basis points, we are quite satisfied with the development also on that level.\r\nMoving now to Beauty Care. Beauty Care now showed a 9th year of consecutive profitable growth, showing an organic net sales growth of 2.0%, driven exclusively by volume, so the price component was flat. The retail business showed a solid organic net sales growth and our Hair Salon business is still characterized by a market decline in the mature markets. And as you know, the mature markets are the majority of our sales, so sales therefore showed a negative development. But also commenting again on that, as Kasper said it, the Q4 of professional was positive in terms of OSG.\r\nThe emerging market grew strongly with a double-digit contribution in the emerging Asia region and here with a double-digit development of China. Africa/Middle East and Latin America showed growth -- strong growth rates. Mature markets could not be maintained on the prior year level. We have a similar situation, like in Laundry, we have a very good development in our Western European countries, which could not fully compensate the situation in North America with a similar reason as pointed out in Laundry & Home Care.\r\nComing also now to the bottom line of Beauty Care. We have seen an increase of our adjusted EBIT margin in 2014 of 30 basis points bringing us to a level of 15.3%. Also here, the comparison on a long-term basis, since 2008, we increased the margin by 270 basis points, or respectively, since 2012 of 80 basis points.\r\nNet working capital is, also here, on a very good level of 1.3%, being up 180 basis points. Here are 2 effects, which are remarkable on the one side also, the FX from acquisitions, which amount to 80 basis points, but here, we have also a fixed FX of roughly 60 basis points, so in total, 140 basis points on a -- to make it like-for-like.\r\nWith that, moving now to our Adhesive Technology division. And also stating here, we have 49% of our sales in the total group which are amounting -- or representable for Adhesives, we have seen a solid organic net sales growth of 3.7%, which are a balanced mix of volume and price. To be precise, 270 basis points is volume, 100 basis points is price.\r\nAll segments contributed to that development, especially General Industry segment showed a strong -- or very strong organic net sales growth. All other segments had a solid development when it comes to OSG.\r\nEmerging markets, especially here, a strong development with Russia and China being double-digit, but also strong developments from Mexico and India. Mature markets recorded a positive organic net sales growth, here again, the strong development or a good development in Western Europe and mature Asia could overcompensate the slight negative development in North America.\r\nBottom line, adjusted EBIT margin is up 30 basis points to an all-time high level of 17.2%. And if you also look here, historically back, we have increased since 2008, 710 basis points, the adjusted EBIT margin in Adhesives, and since 2012 of 210 basis points.\r\nNet working capital is at the level of 12.2%, also here, impacted by FX and acquisition. FX amounts for 60 basis points -- sorry, acquisition amounts for 60 basis points while FX amounts for 90, so in total, 150 basis points in order to come to a like-for-like comparison so there we would be up only 70 basis points. So very satisfied also here with net working capital.\r\nWith that, I move -- would like to move further in our income statement adjustment and starting with gross margins or from sales to gross margins. I have commented on the sales development of EUR 16.428 million. We have a gross profit of EUR 7,798,000,000, which is down compared to the prior year of minus 0.8%. That brings our margin to 50 basis points reduction compared to the prior year. I already commented on, that the prior year was a high comparable and that we are 50 basis points down, but compared to 2012, we are 40 basis points up. So especially here, increase in our raw material costs as one item and also the high promotional intensity could -- were affecting our 2014 numbers and we could not overcompensate that by good cost development measures and efficiency gains, which we realized in our supply chain area.\r\nWith that, moving to our -- further in our income statement adjusted now from gross profit to EBIT. You see marketing, selling and distribution expenses decreased in percentage of sales, especially to efficiency gains realized in selling and distribution expenses. After the adjustment for foreign exchange effects, we kept our absolute marketing spend for a full year. Stable, take into account that we have a number -- significant reduced number of brands, which we support as Kasper is pointing that out. So less than 300 brands, we have now in our portfolio. And on top, we spent more efficiently and strong -- and therefore strongly supporting our key brands.\r\nOverall, our clear strategy is to grow sales, increase market shares and have margins increasing. And this is the balanced why how we steer and how we develop the situation when it comes to the mix of advertising and the market conditions related to promotions.\r\nR&D expenses are at the level of 2.5% related to sales and are almost on the level of 2013. Administration expenses in absolute terms are down by 2%. With strict cost discipline and efficiency focus behind, the percentage of sales remains on the level of the year before. We have operating -- other operating income -- other operating expense balance of EUR 36 million, which is a very low level, and by that, we reached an adjusted EBIT of EUR 2,588,000,000 or a respective margin of 15.8%, which I commented before on.\r\nWith that, I would like to move now to our bridge from reported to adjusted EBIT. You see onetime gains of EUR 28 million. We have onetime charges of EUR 159 million. I would like to comment on 2 specific topics here: first, as already commented in Q3, we have been negatively impacted by expenses of EUR 100 million -- EUR 109 million for provisions related to proceedings by Anti-Trust Authorities in Europe and the proceedings are related to violations occurred between the years 2003 and 2006, so more than 10 years below; secondly, we have charges related to the setup of our global supply chain setup, the integrated global supply chain company, which were amounting of roughly EUR 40 million.\r\nMoving to our expenses regarding restructuring, in total EUR 230 million, which is above the prior year, but which is in line with the guidance we have given to you at the beginning of 2014.\r\nWith that, we come to the EUR 2.588 billion I just mentioned before in terms of adjusted EBIT for 2014.\r\nLooking at the bottom line, profit expansion is ensured in a tough environment. Why do I come to that conclusion? If you see the financial results, EUR 49 million of negative, which is an improvement of 56% or EUR 64 million compared to the prior year, and we paid taxes on income of EUR 533 million, which is related to an effective tax rate at 24%, also here in line what we, in general, see for the year and therefore we come with a net income of EUR 1,662,000,000.\r\nClosing the financials. Looking at the net financial situation, you see the minus EUR 153 million, I commented on, and there are 3 topics to be mentioned: first, we invested roughly at EUR 1.8 billion in acquisitions, which you are aware of; secondly, we paid dividends of around EUR 550 million, which is EUR 100 million more than the comparable year 2013; and we also invested more into PPE and intangible assets, roughly EUR 500 million, also EUR 100 million more than the year before.\r\nWith that, we still -- taking our A-flat rating into account, we have a financial headroom of roughly EUR 4 billion to EUR 4.5 billion. And taking a step back over the last years, you see that we have improved the situation by EUR 3.6 billion.\r\nWith that, I'm moving now to the excellence in value creation and taking 3 steps: one, on organic performance; second, on acquisitions; and third, on cash return options.\r\nLet me start with the organic performance. We are seeing a situation that we increased our capital expenditures by 19% now to a level of EUR 517 million compared to EUR 230 million, this is in line within our guidance. We significantly increased the share of investments in our emerging markets, as you can see from the chart, plus 30%. And thereof, we are spending now 1/2 of the group capital expenditures in the emerging markets and for sure then, the other 1/2 in the mature markets. The investments are focused on expansion and optimization projects, 2/3 of that. And we also, as pointed out several times before, significantly increased our investments in our IT infrastructure, which brings me to the next point because we would like to further build on our scalable business model, where IT investments are one of the major focus areas. We are focusing on best-in-class processes, IT focus and global supply chain. I will not spend so much on shared services because Kasper has already done that. We significantly increased the number of people already now to a level of more than 2,600 and we are well ahead of our plan to reach the 3,000 people, which we have foreseen for the end of 2016. And we finalized our global footprint with opening 2 shared service centers in Cairo and Shanghai.\r\nWith the IT platform, we would like to further consolidate. We are doing the second initiatives by consolidating our IT systems. We executed that in Asia. We reduced the number of ERP systems from 21 to 1 system, which is fully in operation in -- since 2014, and we started to roll out, as the majority of the rollout in Europe will start in 2015, in order to continue the execution what we have done in Asia.\r\nAnd finally, coming to our global supply chain company. Here, we have completed the blueprint. It is about further milestone in standardization and harmonization and process optimization of our processes. We would like to have an integrated setup of our global supply chain organizations of the 3 business divisions, including our purchasing activities. And we have established, at the end of 2014, our supply company in Amsterdam. And we will continue to work on these over the next years.\r\nWith that, moving to our acquisitions, a very disciplined and focused approach. Also with execution measures in 2014, EUR 1.8 billion, we spent in acquisitions on all our 3 business divisions, and by that, further strengthening our positions in attractive segments in Laundry & Home Care. Besides the brand E! in Poland, we had the major acquisition of the Spotless Group, which has a purchase price -- or an enterprise value of EUR 940 million. In the Beauty Care area, despite the acquisition of Pert in Latin America, we acquired the 3 professional hair care businesses in North America, where we spent EUR 274 million. And in Adhesive Technologies, we acquired the Bergquist company at the end of the year. And here, a clear point, where we would like to further gain technological leadership in growing markets of the electronic industry and we spent EUR 467 million on that.\r\nGoing forward, we remain committed to the acquisitions. And we will continue our disciplined and very focused approach, where we definitely have our criteria, which have not changed. That means strategic fit, financial attractiveness and availability of targets and then we will also correspondingly execute.\r\nThe last pillar, our cash return options. As already mentioned, this year, again, we will propose at the Annual General Meeting, 13th of April, that we will propose a dividend payout of roughly 30% of our adjusted net income after controlling interests. And this is in line with our change of our dividend policy, which we disclosed last year from 25% to a range of 25% to 35%. If you look on our further -- on our dividend, you'll see the 25% over the last years and in '13 and '14, the 30%, which will bring us to a dividend of EUR 131 million for the preferred shares, being up more than 7% -- 7.4%. And this translates into a total amount of dividend of EUR 569 million, and by that, an increase of EUR 40 million to the year before.\r\nWith that, I'm at the end and would like to hand back over to Kasper.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Kasper Rorsted (Executives)】\nThank you very much, Carsten. Coming to the end, let me just comment on chances and opportunities in our global market, because the question I've been asked very frequently when I met with many of you in 2014. And I have chosen to comment on our 4 largest countries in the world: U.S., Germany, China and Russia. And that is the sequence of the stack. The U.S. clearly represents a huge opportunity for us moving forward. We have invested heavily in the U.S. market in 2014, not only in OpEx but also on CapEx. I mentioned in my presentation and Carsten detailed about the acquisitions we have done to not only strengthen, but also expand our position in the U.S. And clearly, we've not executed up to par. We will do that and you can rely on that. We are very, very committed to make sure that the U.S. will get back to its role within the organization as the biggest country, which is already, but also as a revenue contributor and as a EBIT gross contributor.\r\nGermany, you have to win your home games, and we have done that in the past several years also in 2014. Germany was an exceptionally good year for us in 2014, not only in terms of growth but also EBIT expansion and market share expansion. We will continue to defend and grow our home turf.\r\nChina, a lot of people have been concerned about the growth rates in China from a GDP standpoint, going to 7% or 7.2% outlook for 2015, which is very similar, by the way, to the GDP number in '14. I've been consistently, almost in the last 4 to 5 years, been asked about when do we see the slowdown in China. Of course, there is a economic slowdown. Despite that, we continue to grow double-digit in China, and China is an over proportionally profitable market for us. We also, as you know, invest ahead of time. We have 16 plants, building the 17th. We are expanding our footprint when it comes to offices, when it comes to people. We will continue to expand in China, and we continue to be bullish around China.\r\nRussia. Russia is -- or was our fourth largest country in the world, has been an exceptional success story for Henkel, and we grew very rapidly also in the past year. Of course, in nominal terms, we have been heavily impacted by the ruble. But I do want to remind all of you when I have said this in one-to-one meetings, this is the fourth crisis we're experiencing in Russia. Our experiences have been by sticking in Russia and staying the course, we have, in the long term, strengthened our market share position, and that is our position in Russia. Russia will, in the short to medium-term, be a challenge for us, but in the long term a huge opportunity. We have no change in our Russia strategy.\r\nMoving to 2014. It was overall a robust performance in a challenging and volatile environment. We delivered our key financial indicators in 2014 despite challenging markets, with very strong adverse currency. We strengthened our portfolio with high-quality assets, predominantly in mature countries, which might represent a lesser growth opportunity, but are very strong from an earnings opportunity. And with the U.S. position, I'm certain that we are not only strategically but also tactically improved our position in the U.S. We saw a solid organic sales growth driven all -- by all business groups. We saw very strong organic sales growth in the emerging markets at 7.8%, which is almost similar to previous years, despite the Russian crisis, despite the war in the Middle East, et cetera. And we saw an all-time high of our EBIT margin in high single-digit EPS growth. It is another, what we call, successful year towards our 2016 targets that we've set ourselves and we are very committed to.\r\nWe see 2015 as an ongoing challenging business environment. We expect a moderate pick-up in global GDP. According to Farrow, GDP grew 2.2% last year and it's supposed to grow 2.8% this year, so there should be an upside. We saw -- we'll see a high volatility in some key currency and crude oil prices. Some will deliver upside, dollar and dollar pegged, and also the raw materials and some will deliver a downside. And we see a persistent geopolitical change, mainly in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East.\r\nAnd now, let me say something which is extremely important, so let me try to be clear on this. As you know, Russia and Ukraine together account for about 7% of Group sales -- at Group sales level. Even if we move production, we are facing stong FX headwinds. Based on the current FX rate levels, which is pretty consistent in the last month, which is why I say current, we expect a transactional and translational impact of around EUR 100 million, negative on Group EBIT for 2015 for Russia and Ukraine together, meaning a decline over '14 of approximately EUR 100 million.\r\nPlease remember also that our total direct materials in Russia and Ukraine are highly dependent on currency movement as a large part is either sourced in euro or U.S. dollar or linked to those currencies. What I do want to stress, and that's why I'm clear, what I've just said is included in the guidance. So the EUR 100 million in Russia and in Ukraine is included in the 10% EPS guidance.\r\nMoving forward, we'll have a focused and balanced investment to foster organic and inorganic growth. We have a clear North American road map, and concrete initiatives has been underway and will show results. We have a strong innovation pipeline. At the same time, we will continue our cost focus and make sure that we adapt our structure to the market, also moving forward.\r\nAnd this leaves me now to the guidance. We expect organic sales growth of 3% to 5%, and Laundry & Home Care and Adhesives being in the same range, Beauty Care at 2%. Emerging market sales at prior level due to predominantly currency, and adjusted EBIT market around 16%. We expect an adjusted EPS growth of 10%, including what I just said about Russia and Ukraine. So I want to be very, very clear, so we don't misunderstand that, that is included in the guidance.\r\nWith this, I'm coming to the end of the presentation. We have our AGM in April. We have our first quarter numbers in May and we have our Investor Conference. And this year, it'll be with focus on Laundry & Home Care. It'll take place in Dusseldorf.\r\nAnd now, we have approximately 10 to 15 minutes -- no, 7 minutes to Q&A. So please, now switch to Q&A.",
      "transcript_text3": "My first question will be on trying to understand better the Q4 EBIT margin performance because you flagged [indiscernible]?\n\n---\n\nI can't hear what you're saying.\r\n[Technical Difficulty]\n\n---\n\nI was wondering if you could talk a bit more about the promotional environment in the U.S. at the moment and the HPC markets? I know it's something you've been saying for a while as a big focus for your management team, but I was wondering if you could give us some more color on the significant changes that you mentioned, that you are taking to confront the issues, and whether you -- whether or not you expect the nature of intensified promotions and pricing pressure to change over the course of 2015?\n\n---\n\nWe do not expect a significant change in the promotional activity in the U.S. We expect, potentially, a slight slowdown, but not any significant change. And we believe that basically we can counteract that is through bringing new and more innovate products into the market. And we believe we have a stronger price innovation pipeline in 2015, but no significant change to the promotional activity in the U.S. in '15.\n\n---\n\nMy first question will be on Eastern Europe, where you have a good acceleration in Q4. Can you talk about your pricing policy in this region, and particularly, in Russia? So can we expect a slowdown in Q1 after the very strong Q4? My second question will be on the EBIT margin expectation of around 16%. Do you think you are groomed to increase the margin of all divisions in 2015?\n\n---\n\nI'll do the first, then Carsten will do the second. Overall, on pricing, we do, of course, see in high inflationary countries that there's room for more pricing. We expect an ongoing pricing going on in Russia in 2015, but the pricing will not be able to offset the currency devaluation that we have seen. So that is a stepwise approach. In Europe, it's a different environment, you have slight pricing going on, but very slight. You're in a pretty much deflationary environment in Western Europe. Carsten, on the margin?\n\n---\n\nYes. Kasper pointed out the guidance for 2015, which is around 16%, and this is driven by all 3 business divisions. So all 3 business divisions will support the increase of our margin.\n\n---\n\nI have 2 questions. The first one on the administrative -- sorry, the A&P cost that has increased in Q4. Can you, I mean, because this is an area where you had been able to lower the A&P because you had said that you had invested more in the promotional side. So are we now at the point where you feel that you need to increase the A&P and should we expect that to be the case for 2015? My second question is on the gross margin. You said that 2014 was impacted by raw material prices. Can you shed light on the road map [ph]? I've seen that you said flat road map guidance. That sounds a bit surprising given the -- how the oil prices have moved. So if you could shed light on that and whether we could expect gross margin to grow again in 2015?\n\n---\n\nSo to the point of marketing spend, I think I used the term of marketing spend especially to explain the reduction of our adjusted EBIT margin in the fourth quarter. We are not guiding -- or we are not looking on quarters when it comes to spendings, we're looking on overall years. And here, I was also clear in the presentation that I've said, we spend FX adjusted roughly the same amount in absolute terms in marketing as the year before, and there is also no change foreseen for the future. One thing is clear, one thing will stay the same, this is the promotion, a level at a very high level. This, for sure, has over the last year, changed also the mix in total, but overall, the situation will not significantly change. That's the first thing. And your question regarding the gross margins. For sure, it is right that the oil prices have gone down significantly, but important is that it takes 3 to 6 months until the things can -- will come through our P&L. Kasper has also alluded on that. For sure, we will take that into account that this will have an impact on our gross margin, but there are a lot of factors, which are impacting our margin. And therefore, this is something where we're not guiding on the gross margin per se, but for sure, the oil will positively impact us.\n\n---\n\nTwo questions. First of all, just back to that -- back regarding the raw material question. Can you put any numbers on that? If oil/the oil derivatives stayed where they were, what's kind of relief would you see for 2015 in terms of absolute numbers? And second of all, looking at the regions, you had a massive EBIT increase in Q4 in Asia-Pacific by, I believe, plus 46%, if my calculation is correct. After a rather weak development at the 9-month level, what is behind that?\n\n---\n\nOn the first one, the comment is no. We don't comment on it. And on the second, we're very happy to come back to you on that. That is simply -- that is not, by default, a, what do you call, a one-to-one comparison. There's probably onetime items, and we we'll get back to you on that. I can't answer it on the fly, so to speak. We'll get back to you.\n\n---\n\nTwo quick questions. Firstly, could you quantify the impact from acquisitions on the margins in Q4? You did flag it out as being one of the reasons for them being down. And then secondly, on acquisitions, you also mentioned that they were impact -- negatively impacting your working capital development. Do you expect that also to be a drag for your working capital in 2015?\n\n---\n\nSo to your first questions, I could, but we are not disclosing these numbers. And for the second point, I think we have proven over the last years that we are very strong in developing our net working capital and that's for sure now the task of the operated businesses in Laundry, in Beauty Care and in Adhesives to take the measures we have taken into our organization and also to integrate that in the way how we deal in these 3 now integrated businesses and how long this will take, I cannot comment on. This will be shown over the next quarters. But for sure, we are very -- we know exactly what we need to do and therefore we will also drive that in that direction where Henkel has been before.\n\n---\n\nAnd last question please.\n\n---\n\nSo 2 questions for me. Firstly, U.S. Laundry. It's been a while since we've heard anything about a big, sort of, Purex innovation and that's clearly a bit business that's been struggling. Does U.S. Laundry need a stronger innovation pipeline and is that part of the changes? And then secondly, just on professional hair care. You called out how you're now the #3 in U.S. professional hair care. How do you feel about professional hair care as a cash accretive [ph], it's clearly been slow in recent years but is it still somewhere that you see as being structurally attractive?\n\n---\n\nOn a -- on the innovation in the U.S., I was very clear on that we needed a stronger innovation pipeline. We believe we have that and you can see that throughout the year on some of the Purex products that will come into market. So we are confident that we have an appropriate pipeline when it comes to Laundry in the U.S. Overall, the reason why -- question 1. Question 2, on professional hair care, it is an attractive category, predominantly because most of the innovation that takes place related to hair coloration takes place in the professional side. And hair coloration has an over-proportionally high margin, which is why it's very attractive. It has been a category that has been characterized by negative growth in probably the last 2 to 3 years. But we believe, over time, it will return back to growth. But it is really the key. If you want to be the leader in hair coloration in retail, it is a pre-assumption or prerequisite to also be in professional hair care. And that's why, I believe, it's a very attractive market to be in from a margin standpoint. And it will grow over time. It's had a very difficult period as a category in the last 3 years.\r\nWith this, I'd like to come to a close, and thank everybody for dialing in today. Within a challenging environment, characterized by high volatility, political tensions and persistent high-promotion pressure, we have delivered a robust performance in 2014. Looking ahead at 2015, it seems to be a year with exciting opportunities, but also several challenges. However, we're confident and thanks to our innovative strength and strong brands, coupled with a continuous adaption of our structure to the market and by further driving operational excellence, we will continue throughout '15 to outperform in '15 and beyond. That's why, we believe, the 10% EPS target is an appropriate target. I wish you all the best and look forward to talking to you on May 7, 2015, for the first quarter.\r\nAnd before I close, I'd like, again, to remind you of our Investor and Analyst conference, hosted by Bruno Piacenza and his team of the Laundry & Home Care business unit. It will take place Monday, June 1, 2015, here in Dusseldorf. The invitation including agenda and further details will follow soon, but please save the date.\r\nThank you very much, and thank you for dialing in today.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Gael Colcombet (Analysts)】\nMy first question will be on trying to understand better the Q4 EBIT margin performance because you flagged [indiscernible]?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kasper Rorsted (Executives)】\nI can't hear what you're saying.\r\n[Technical Difficulty]\n\n---\n\n【質問: Katherine Tait (Analysts)】\nI was wondering if you could talk a bit more about the promotional environment in the U.S. at the moment and the HPC markets? I know it's something you've been saying for a while as a big focus for your management team, but I was wondering if you could give us some more color on the significant changes that you mentioned, that you are taking to confront the issues, and whether you -- whether or not you expect the nature of intensified promotions and pricing pressure to change over the course of 2015?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kasper Rorsted (Executives)】\nWe do not expect a significant change in the promotional activity in the U.S. We expect, potentially, a slight slowdown, but not any significant change. And we believe that basically we can counteract that is through bringing new and more innovate products into the market. And we believe we have a stronger price innovation pipeline in 2015, but no significant change to the promotional activity in the U.S. in '15.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Hermine de Bentzmann (Analysts)】\nMy first question will be on Eastern Europe, where you have a good acceleration in Q4. Can you talk about your pricing policy in this region, and particularly, in Russia? So can we expect a slowdown in Q1 after the very strong Q4? My second question will be on the EBIT margin expectation of around 16%. Do you think you are groomed to increase the margin of all divisions in 2015?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kasper Rorsted (Executives)】\nI'll do the first, then Carsten will do the second. Overall, on pricing, we do, of course, see in high inflationary countries that there's room for more pricing. We expect an ongoing pricing going on in Russia in 2015, but the pricing will not be able to offset the currency devaluation that we have seen. So that is a stepwise approach. In Europe, it's a different environment, you have slight pricing going on, but very slight. You're in a pretty much deflationary environment in Western Europe. Carsten, on the margin?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Carsten Knobel (Executives)】\nYes. Kasper pointed out the guidance for 2015, which is around 16%, and this is driven by all 3 business divisions. So all 3 business divisions will support the increase of our margin.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Celine Pannuti (Analysts)】\nI have 2 questions. The first one on the administrative -- sorry, the A&P cost that has increased in Q4. Can you, I mean, because this is an area where you had been able to lower the A&P because you had said that you had invested more in the promotional side. So are we now at the point where you feel that you need to increase the A&P and should we expect that to be the case for 2015? My second question is on the gross margin. You said that 2014 was impacted by raw material prices. Can you shed light on the road map [ph]? I've seen that you said flat road map guidance. That sounds a bit surprising given the -- how the oil prices have moved. So if you could shed light on that and whether we could expect gross margin to grow again in 2015?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Carsten Knobel (Executives)】\nSo to the point of marketing spend, I think I used the term of marketing spend especially to explain the reduction of our adjusted EBIT margin in the fourth quarter. We are not guiding -- or we are not looking on quarters when it comes to spendings, we're looking on overall years. And here, I was also clear in the presentation that I've said, we spend FX adjusted roughly the same amount in absolute terms in marketing as the year before, and there is also no change foreseen for the future. One thing is clear, one thing will stay the same, this is the promotion, a level at a very high level. This, for sure, has over the last year, changed also the mix in total, but overall, the situation will not significantly change. That's the first thing. And your question regarding the gross margins. For sure, it is right that the oil prices have gone down significantly, but important is that it takes 3 to 6 months until the things can -- will come through our P&L. Kasper has also alluded on that. For sure, we will take that into account that this will have an impact on our gross margin, but there are a lot of factors, which are impacting our margin. And therefore, this is something where we're not guiding on the gross margin per se, but for sure, the oil will positively impact us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christian Faitz (Analysts)】\nTwo questions. First of all, just back to that -- back regarding the raw material question. Can you put any numbers on that? If oil/the oil derivatives stayed where they were, what's kind of relief would you see for 2015 in terms of absolute numbers? And second of all, looking at the regions, you had a massive EBIT increase in Q4 in Asia-Pacific by, I believe, plus 46%, if my calculation is correct. After a rather weak development at the 9-month level, what is behind that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kasper Rorsted (Executives)】\nOn the first one, the comment is no. We don't comment on it.

There's probably onetime items, and we we'll get back to you on that. I can't answer it on the fly, so to speak. We'll get back to you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Targett (Analysts)】\nTwo quick questions. Firstly, could you quantify the impact from acquisitions on the margins in Q4? You did flag it out as being one of the reasons for them being down. And then secondly, on acquisitions, you also mentioned that they were impact -- negatively impacting your working capital development. Do you expect that also to be a drag for your working capital in 2015?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Carsten Knobel (Executives)】\nSo to your first questions, I could, but we are not disclosing these numbers.

      "transcript_text1": "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, here from Dusseldorf, and welcome to our conference call. First, I'd like to focus on the key developments of the fiscal year 2014, followed by an update on where we stand in terms of the execution of our strategy in 2016. Then Carsten will provide you with the financials in detail of the full year and how we created shareholder value in 2014. And after that, I will close my presentation with a brief summary for 2014 and the outlook for '15, and finally, we will be happy to take your questions.\r\nI'd like to begin by reminding everyone that the presentation, which contains the usual formal disclaimer to forward-looking statements within the meaning of relevant U.S. legislation, can be accessed via our website at henkel.com/ir. The presentation discussions are conducted subject to the disclaimer. We will not read the disclaimer, but propose we take it as read into the records for the purpose of this conference call.\r\nAnd now let's get started. We have 4 items: key developments '14; strategy progress for '16; financials '14; and extended value creation and the end summary and outlook for FY '15. And then, we'll go to the Q&A session.\r\nAlthough it was a rough -- robust performance in a challenging volatile environment, we grew our organic sales growth by 3.4%. Our adjusted EBIT margin hit an all-time high of 15.8%, adjusted earnings per share growth of 7.6%. Our free cash flow came in at EUR 1.3 billion. We invested EUR 1.8 billion in acquisitions, and our dividend payout is proposed to save 30%, but of course, with an increase relative to the earnings per share growth. We'll look at the further details on that later on.\r\nSo how do we perform against guidance? We guided our organic sales growth between 3% and 5%. We came in within the range, but the lower part of the range at 3.4%. On the emerging market sales, we expected a slight increase in nominal sales and we ended up at prior level. I don't want to stress at this point in time that we had an exceptionally strong year when we take the emerging markets condition as consideration. We grew high single-digit, and we're very happy with our overall performance in our emerging markets. The only deviation to the slight increase is currency driven. There's nothing organic that is below our expectation. Our adjusted EBIT margin, we guided at just under 16% and we came in at 15.8%. And our adjusted EPS growth, we guided high single-digit, defined as 7% to 9%. Following the second quarter, we made a revision within the range and said we'll be closer to 7% than 9%, we came out at 7.6%. We're pretty much in the middle of the range, but within -- clearly within the range of our guidance.\r\nNow let me describe how we saw the year. We see a consistent execution on our 2016 strategy, so we are doing the things we said we would do under our 4 strategic priorities and executing that very diligently.\r\nWe have conducted a high-quality set of acquisitions that will strengthen our market position in the short, as well as in the long-term. Very much in the core of what we're doing -- they're -- very market-wise, very attractive, and we believe, possesses very little risk and attractive from an earnings standpoint.\r\nWe saw a solid organic sales growth, driven by all business. And we continue to see very strong organic sales growth in the emerging markets. Carsten will speak later about that, but this is an area we are very satisfied with.\r\nOur adjusted EBIT margin hit an all-time high, driven by all business groups. And our adjusted EPS growth came in at a high-single digit. As I said, that will mean a further increase in dividend, assuming the payout ratio of 30% will be approved by the AGM, which will take place in approximately 6 weeks from now.\r\nThere are also areas that we are less concerned about. There are some macro areas, there are some  micro areas and there are some which are self-inflicted. On the macro side, we have clearly had substantial FX headwind, particularly in the first half of 2014, pretty much until August and that is now being ongoing since '13 until mid-'14. We continue to see severe geopolitical and social unrest in some of the countries we conduct business in, particularly Middle East, and despite that, we continue to deliver very strong performance, but of course, has an impact on the overall growth rate.\r\nWe are seeing the Eastern European economy being impacted by the Russian and Ukraine crisis. Ukraine and Russia is, of course, impacted. And as I've stated very clearly in every quarterly call in 2014, we are seeing a slowdown in the Eastern European economy because of this political situation.\r\nOn the macro side -- on the micro side, we've seen a further intensified price and promotion pressure on the HPC market in most markets across the board, which is an unfortunate development of the HPC market. And as I've also been clear on similar calls, North America has been clearly below our expectations in 2014. We have undertaken significant changes to ensure that that won't happen again. And we'll see when we start with pulling the numbers in '15, how that will come about. But clearly, North America was below expectations, particularly when we look upon the overall upside that economy represents.\r\nLet me move to Laundry & Home Care. We've seen, inside our organic sales growth in the past year, Laundry being solid and Homecare and some more of the specialty categories, being very strong. The mature markets, we saw Western Europe being solid despite a not very exciting economy in Western Europe and North America being negative. The emerging markets continued its double-digit growth rate in 2014. We saw adjusted EBIT margin showing a very strong increase throughout the year and ROCE was below the level of previous yeas because of number of onetime items that Carsten will be commenting on more in detail.\r\nWe also are seeing a continuous strength in our innovation pipeline. Approximately, 45% of our business in this area is done by products that has been introduced in the last 3 years. And our innovation helped us differentiate in the marketplace and also take pricing in the marketplace. That has helped to drive the top line but also the improvement on the bottom line. Vernel, which is one product I'd like to mention here, is where you're starting to see some of the trends from the Beauty Care market segments coming in to the Laundry & Home Care segments. And here, you're seeing the inclusion of oils within a detergent-related products. As you know, oils were introduced, particularly in hair products, approximately 2 to 3 years ago. A very exciting product, we patented the build of materials and the way the product has been constructed. It is implemented in a set of countries in the fourth quarter and will be fully implemented in Western and Eastern Europe by the third quarter of 2015.\r\nOn the Beauty Care side, we saw a more solid organic sales growth. Retail was solid. Hair Salon was negative -- was positive in the fourth quarter but I do not want to make any final judgments on whether the market has finally turned. On the mature markets, Western Europe continued to be positive with similar comments as I gave in the Laundry & Home Care side in North America, also here disappointing.\r\nEmerging markets continued to be strong. China, double-digit. Just to remind everybody, we are not present in China in Laundry & Home Care, which is why I didn't say -- I didn't comment on China in Laundry & Home Care. The adjusted EBIT margin continued to show solid increase and ROCE will be below previous years or it is below previous years for the same reasons as stated in Laundry & Home Care, which Carsten will comment on.\r\nAlso in this area, 45% of our sales is conducted by products which have been introduced in the last 3 years. And in 2014, we introduced Schwarzkopf Essence ULTÎME, which is a high-end hair product serials [ph]. It is noncomparable to Syoss. I want to be very clear on this. So where Syoss is a volume product, this is a high-end product with a very different margin portfolio and incremental to the market shares that we're gaining here, because in this market segment, we've not been present before. So we're very excited about the introduction of this product and it's gone according to plan in 2014.\r\nNow let me move to our biggest business group, Adhesive Technologies, where we saw a solid OSG and solid adjusted EBIT margin improvements in 2014. We saw, as I said, all -- solid organic sales growth in all businesses growing, particularly what we call our General Industry, our Loctite business, was very strong in 2014. In the mature markets, again, a similar picture, Western Europe positive, North America negative and the emerging markets are strong, China double-digit, also in the fourth quarter. We saw the adjusted EBIT margins showing solid increase, an all-time high, and also ROCE further increased.\r\nWhen it comes to our Adhesive Technology. Particularly, technology in this space, it helps us differentiate in the marketplace and drive pricing, actually, into the market place, which has been part of the reason why we've been able to take the market from 10% to above 17% in the past 6 years. In this area, we have approximately 30% of our business being conducted with products that have less than 5 years in the marketplace. This is a different factor, because simply some of the products that we introduced that customers do not want us to change them over a longer period of time. I speak about Automotive, where you have a life cycle of a car of 7 years; or Aerospace, where it's of course longer. So that's where you simply cannot change the product as quickly as in other areas simply because of the customer requirements.\r\nOne of the areas that are quite exciting is our overall Surface Treatment business, where in the past we've only delivered products. Now with some of our new products, we're also delivering total solution, so i.e., also making certain that the product is being applied to the customer product. In this area, we've had some very exciting wins, particularly in the separate [ph] markets, where we're not only delivering the product but also conducting the application of the product to the customer product. So a much more solution-driven business, which is very much in line with what we're trying to do, deliver differentiation through technology and application know-how.\r\nThat was, in highlight, how 2014 went. Now let me just review where we are in our strategy execution towards 2016. We all know our strategy built around outperform, globalize, simplify and inspire, and our 3 financial targets, 20-10-10, where our 10% EPS CAGR is our primary target towards 2016 and the one where we made substantial progress.\r\nIt's clear that we then made the progress under EUR 20 billion sales so far, simply because of one item, headwinds in currency. We expect that to change in 2015 and make a substantial step forward, but that has been the primary reason for the lack of progress on the 20. As I said, our primary guidance value is the 10% EPS CAGR.\r\nOn outperform, we are conducting a number of activities, which will continue to help us make us more competitive. On our top brands, our top 3 brands today account for EUR 5 billion and our top 10 brands from 59% of our total sales. A couple of years ago, one of the criticisms around Henkel was, we don't have any strong brands. As you can see, our top 10 brands, which account for 60% of our business, almost have a average of EUR 1 billion a piece. And that, of course, allows us to spend much more focus on marketing spend because we have fewer brands to spend on.\r\nOn innovation, I've spoken about that. It is helping us drive differentiation and it's helping, of course, drive pricing into the marketplace. And we are seeing an increase in the innovation rate across all businesses.\r\nOn our R&D centers, we stated that we would open up 7 new R&D centers in the emerging countries by 2016. We have so far opened up 5 and 2 to go, and we're very confident that we will also open up the remaining 2 and we'll report separately on that when we've done so far. But overall, we are building the infrastructure, consolidating our brands and driving innovation that will allow us to continue to what we're trying to do, grow profitably towards our 2016 targets.\r\nOn globalize, we are focusing on regions with high potentials. And this is where mature and emerging markets play 2 different roles. In the mature markets, we want to consolidate our strong market positions and increase leveraging to profitability. And we will invest to drive efficiency into this area, so we expect slower growth rates but higher profitability. We are seeing that particularly in Europe in 2014, which was an exceptionally good year.\r\nOn the emerging markets, they need to continue to drive our top line growth for the future, and of course, also over time, increase profitability. In order to do so, we are investing heavily in our emerging markets. And for the first year ever, the total amount of CapEx investments were now 50-50 between mature markets and emerging markets. So we are clearly investing for the future in the emerging markets, whether it's manufacturing, processes, systems or people.\r\nWe've also spent EUR 1.8 billion in acquisitions to strengthen our core business, moving forward. We've done, I would say, EUR 3.5 billion or EUR 4 billion on our Laundry & Home Care business. We acquired a number of brands in our core business, Laundry Additives and Insecticides in Europe to strengthen our core position in Laundry, but also it now put us into a #2 position in Insecticides in Europe. We have a strong position in the U.S., and we are market leader in Korea. And in the beginning of the year, we acquired the brand E! in Poland to strengthen our Laundry position in Poland. In our Beauty Care business, we acquired 3 brands in the U.S., which make us now #3 in the professional haircare market in the U.S. I just want to remind everybody, by 2010, we had a 0 position in the U.S. and right now, we are #3 in the U.S., so a very strong position in attractive marketplace. And in our Adhesive business, we acquired the Bergquist Company, the leader in thermal management systems, so the distribution of heat generated by processors in the electronics industry. The electronics industry can be consumer electronics, of course, business electronics or automotive or aerospace. This will help expand our position in the overall electronics market, which is very attractive, not only from a growth standpoint but also from a profitability standpoint. So we believe, we have invested actively in very attractive acquisitions, with very attractive P&Ls that will help the company moving forward, not only towards 2016 but also beyond.\r\nOn simplify, making us a better company, so driving a much more scalable business model, we now have more than 2,600 people in shared service centers. And this year, we opened Cairo and Shanghai, so we're now present globally in shared services. And we're confident towards moving towards the target of having more than 3,000 people working in shared services by 2016. We converted 45,000 employees to a new digital platform in 2014 without any disruption. We finalized the rollout of SAP horizon in Asia and are now starting to -- starting the implementation work in Europe without any business disruption, which is not self-explanatory. A lot of companies are suffering in this area. We had a very successful rollout.\r\nAnd we created our global supply chain company, set up in Amsterdam. And we're looking for further sourcing hubs for the future that will allow our global supply chain to operate more efficiently. Overall, we are building a scalable business model.\r\nBut most importantly, we'll continue to strengthen our global management team. There is no doubt that the core reason why we've been able to consistently improve our performance has been through good and solid execution done globally by good leadership. And we are working effectively with Harvard Business School to ensure that our top 200 leaders are trained by trainers, so to speak, a co-development program between Henkel and Harvard that ensures that our senior leaders across the company knows what is expected from them from a cultural standpoint, but also from a performance standpoint. We are a performance-driven company.\r\nOn talent and performance. We continue to conduct our, what we call, Development Round Table, where we're steckling [ph] our people to ensure that we treat people fairly but differently. We want to make sure that the top performers get top attention within our company and performance is recognized. And that allows us also to promote more than 1,000 people internally. Internal promotion is a high priority for us under the assumption that the performance is appropriate and the compliance to our values is in order.\r\nDiversity, the last point. 33% of our managers are women, but even more important, we have a global work force. We have today, in our top managers, Chinese, Arabs, Russians, Americans, Latin Americans, and that is what truly characterizes a global company. We do not want to be a global-managed company. We are a global company, globally headquartered in Germany, but we want to have a global management team. And we made substantial progress on this, where in most regions, the regions are run by strong local leaders.\r\nNow I'd like to hand over to Carsten, who will take us through the financials in detail for 2014. Carsten, please?\n\n---\n\nThank you very much, Kasper. Good morning to everyone. Let's have a now look on our financials for the full year 2014 in more detail. And let's start, as always, with an overview of our key performance indicators and starting here with our sales performance. In 2014, our sales accounted for EUR 16,428,000,000. This is showing a slight increase in nominal terms of 40 basis points due to negative FX effect amounting to 4.0%. Organically, we could increase, again with a solid organic net sales growth, our numbers by 3.4%, supported by all our 3 business divisions.\r\nOur gross margin -- adjusted gross margin came in at 47.5%. This is 50 basis points below the prior year with 48.0%. So with the growth gross margin of 48%, the year 2013 represented a tough and high comparable. If you would compare the 47.5% to the year 2012, this would represent an increase of 40 basis points.\r\nComing now to our adjusted EBIT margin. Our adjusted EBIT margin could be increased for the year 2014 by 40 basis points, now to an all-time high in terms of margin of 15.8%, and by that, representing a strong result, supported by all 3 business divisions.\r\nBefore I now continue with the EPS, let me step back for a moment and comment on the Q4 adjusted EBIT margin of the quarter. This is below the prior year of 60 basis points and there are 3 major reasons behind: first of all, I think you all know that we acquired significantly in the year 2014 and the closing of the majority of the acquisition was in the second half, being more precise even in the quarter 4 of the year. And by that, you can imagine that we have taken integration costs but also inventory step-ups, which are related to IFRS [ph] requirements into -- directly into account, which affected the Q4 2014. But also to be clear, these are onetime effects, which will not occur going into 2015. The second reason behind is the crisis, which you're also aware, in Russia and Ukraine. Besides the translational impact which we face, we have also significant transactional impacts in Russia and in Ukraine hitting our gross margin and by that also hitting our EBIT, and by that, impacting also the margin. And the third point is, we have increased our marketing spend in our fast-moving consumer businesses on a quarter-to-quarter comparison Q4 to Q4 of last year. So these are the 3 main reasons why you see a 60 basis point decline in the Q4 margins. Especially the number, the second reason which I alluded to, the situation in Russia and Ukraine, is something which is not a onetime effect, which will continue definitely also, which we will see in the first half of the year 2015 because the crisis started in the second half of 2014.\r\nWith that, let me come back with the experts [ph] and come now to our adjusted EPS, development of our preferred shares, we reached EUR 4.38, which is an increase of 7.6%, and by that, hitting our high single-digit guidance for EPS in the year 2014, even if it is at the lower end of the range as we indicated it already in Q3 release. So overall, a robust performance and another year of profitable growth.\r\nLet me now come to our cash situation, and here, focusing first on our net working capital development. Net working capital came in at a good level of 4.2%, which is up versus the prior year of 190 basis points, but definitely as a -- on a satisfying level. Please consider, also here, the topic of the recent acquisitions which we did, they have not the same level of net working capital as we are used to, so this has an impact of roughly 70 basis points. And on top, we are also attributable to negative currency effects of roughly 50 basis points. If you add these 2 components, it's 120 basis points. And if you see that, then you would have a like-for-like comparison of roughly 3.0% of net working capital. And if I could remind you on what I said last year, we see our net working capital on a level between 3% and 3.5%. That's the reason why we see this number of 4.2% on the satisfying level for 2014. Nevertheless, we will not give up to further improve net working capital also in the coming years.\r\nComing now to our free cash flow development. We reached the free cash flow of EUR 1,333,000,000, which is in line with the average over the last 6 years, which we take as a reference period since 2008. For sure, this is below the previous year with EUR 1.6 billion, which was an all-time high when it comes to free cash flow.\r\nWith that, let me move now to our net financial position. The net financial position at the end of 2014 reached a level of minus EUR 153 million considering the increased dividend payout, which we had in 2014 and the recent acquisitions of EUR 1.8 billion, which we spent. A remarkable result. So we used also here our cash in a very disciplined way.\r\nAfter this overview, let me now go into the details of the KPIs and starting with our sales situation. As I mentioned before, our sales came in organically with a solid development of 3.4% for the year, and this is split by 40 basis points of price increases or price development and 300 basis points of volume development.\r\nAs anticipated, in 2014, we continued to face a headwind with foreign exchange with 400 basis point, as I mentioned before, the absolute amount is, in that terms, EUR 650 million, and especially, decreasing or depreciation of emerging market currency contributed the majority of that part. And even be more precise, Russia and Ukraine, these 2 countries amount for 1/3 of this EUR 650 million of FX effect.\r\nM&A. The net effect of M&A contributed plus 1.0%. So in total, we reached EUR 16,428,000,000, showing a slight nominal increase as pointed out before of 40 basis points.\r\nHaving now a look on our situation in the emerging markets and the mature markets. You heard already Kasper pointing that out. We were -- have been very satisfied with our development in the emerging markets. We could, again, show a strong organic net sales growth of 7.8%, reaching EUR 7,249,000,000 in absolute terms. And also, our situation in the mature markets was slightly positive with 0.2%, especially with a very satisfying performance in Western Europe.\r\nThe emerging markets now account for 44% of our total sales, despite the FX headwinds. This is a stable situation compared to the prior year. If we would adjust for FX, so for the same level as of last year, we would have increased the emerging market level to 46%.\r\nWith that, I would like to now go into the details of the region and give you a glance of how we have been developing here. And first of all, overall statement, all regions show organic growth besides or except North America. Starting with Western Europe. Western Europe in total amounts for 35% of our total sales. And as you can see, we have increased organically the situation by 1.7%. This is, as I said before, supported by a very good performance in Germany across all business units. But it's also noteworthy to mention that also, in Southern Europe, all major countries showing positive developments besides one country, which is Italy. Italy is still negative in terms of organic net sales development.\r\nComing now to Eastern Europe. Similar to Q3, we see a counterintuitively sales development in Eastern Europe. Eastern Europe is amounting for 70% -- 17% of our sales and we have a polarized situation. We have, in total, an organic net sales growth of 4.5% by Russia, showing a very strong development in terms of organic development, while Ukraine and some other countries are negative.\r\nMoving now to Africa/Middle East. Africa/Middle East, again, in 2014 showed a double-digit development plus 16.9% in terms of organic net sales and development. Coming now to North America, amounting for 18% of our sales. Organic sales remained below the prior year. Our consumer businesses, Laundry & Home Care and Beauty Care, were both impacted by an intense, promotional and price competition, but also our execution was also not always optimal, and by that, impacting our business negatively. The situation in our Adhesive Technology business in North America is different. Here, we are affected by portfolio optimization measures. That means we are deemphasizing our commoditized businesses, especially in the area of packaging -- adhesive packaging and consumer goods.\r\nWith that, I would like to move to Latin America. Latin America amounts for 6% of our total sales, shows solid development in organic net sales growth of 4.4%, with a strong development in Mexico and a flat development in Brazil, especially impacted by the weak development of the market.\r\nFinally, Asia-Pacific. Again, also here, a very strong sales performance, plus 8.2% in terms of organic terms and this was especially driven, as Kasper has pointed it out before, by a double-digit development in China, but also strong development of India.\r\nWith that -- well, let me finalize the situation in terms of commenting on our BRIC situation. I have done it more or less by summarizing it. BRIC, a very good development, double-digit in China, very strong in Russia and India, and the only one was flat is Brazil.\r\nWith that, I would like to move to our 3 divisions, and starting now with Laundry & Home Care. Laundry & Home Care amounts for 28% of our total sales of the company, showed an organic growth of 4.6%, driven by volume of 5.1%, and by that, overcompensating a negative pricing effect of 50 basis points. And the 2 businesses, Kasper mentioned it, Laundry showed a solid organic net sales growth while the Home Care business were very strong in terms of growing organically.\r\nThe emerging market, again, in 2014, showed double-digit development with Eastern Europe and a solid development, while Asia-Pacific and Latin America both were very strong, and Africa/Middle East in a double-digit development.\r\nMature markets remained below the prior year. We had a good development in Western Europe, supported by a good development of Germany, but that could not fully compensate the situation you're aware of in North America where we have a negative development due to a fierce promotional environment and on top of declining markets in 2014.\r\nBottom line situation. Adjusted EBIT margin, again, could be increased by 60 basis points on a full year basis now to a level of 16.2%, this is an all-time high. Also if we give you now a longer perspective, since 2008, we have improved the adjusted EBIT margin in Laundry & Home Care by 450 basis points since 2012. This development shows an increase of 240 basis points.\r\nFinalizing the situation in Laundry & Home Care with a look on net working capital. We show, here also, a very good number of minus 6.6%. This is above the prior year of 140 basis points. But if you consider, also here, the M&A effect, which amounts to 70 basis points, we are quite satisfied with the development also on that level.\r\nMoving now to Beauty Care. Beauty Care now showed a 9th year of consecutive profitable growth, showing an organic net sales growth of 2.0%, driven exclusively by volume, so the price component was flat. The retail business showed a solid organic net sales growth and our Hair Salon business is still characterized by a market decline in the mature markets. And as you know, the mature markets are the majority of our sales, so sales therefore showed a negative development. But also commenting again on that, as Kasper said it, the Q4 of professional was positive in terms of OSG.\r\nThe emerging market grew strongly with a double-digit contribution in the emerging Asia region and here with a double-digit development of China. Africa/Middle East and Latin America showed growth -- strong growth rates. Mature markets could not be maintained on the prior year level. We have a similar situation, like in Laundry, we have a very good development in our Western European countries, which could not fully compensate the situation in North America with a similar reason as pointed out in Laundry & Home Care.\r\nComing also now to the bottom line of Beauty Care. We have seen an increase of our adjusted EBIT margin in 2014 of 30 basis points bringing us to a level of 15.3%. Also here, the comparison on a long-term basis, since 2008, we increased the margin by 270 basis points, or respectively, since 2012 of 80 basis points.\r\nNet working capital is, also here, on a very good level of 1.3%, being up 180 basis points. Here are 2 effects, which are remarkable on the one side also, the FX from acquisitions, which amount to 80 basis points, but here, we have also a fixed FX of roughly 60 basis points, so in total, 140 basis points on a -- to make it like-for-like.\r\nWith that, moving now to our Adhesive Technology division. And also stating here, we have 49% of our sales in the total group which are amounting -- or representable for Adhesives, we have seen a solid organic net sales growth of 3.7%, which are a balanced mix of volume and price. To be precise, 270 basis points is volume, 100 basis points is price.\r\nAll segments contributed to that development, especially General Industry segment showed a strong -- or very strong organic net sales growth. All other segments had a solid development when it comes to OSG.\r\nEmerging markets, especially here, a strong development with Russia and China being double-digit, but also strong developments from Mexico and India. Mature markets recorded a positive organic net sales growth, here again, the strong development or a good development in Western Europe and mature Asia could overcompensate the slight negative development in North America.\r\nBottom line, adjusted EBIT margin is up 30 basis points to an all-time high level of 17.2%. And if you also look here, historically back, we have increased since 2008, 710 basis points, the adjusted EBIT margin in Adhesives, and since 2012 of 210 basis points.\r\nNet working capital is at the level of 12.2%, also here, impacted by FX and acquisition. FX amounts for 60 basis points -- sorry, acquisition amounts for 60 basis points while FX amounts for 90, so in total, 150 basis points in order to come to a like-for-like comparison so there we would be up only 70 basis points. So very satisfied also here with net working capital.\r\nWith that, I move -- would like to move further in our income statement adjustment and starting with gross margins or from sales to gross margins. I have commented on the sales development of EUR 16.428 million. We have a gross profit of EUR 7,798,000,000, which is down compared to the prior year of minus 0.8%. That brings our margin to 50 basis points reduction compared to the prior year. I already commented on, that the prior year was a high comparable and that we are 50 basis points down, but compared to 2012, we are 40 basis points up. So especially here, increase in our raw material costs as one item and also the high promotional intensity could -- were affecting our 2014 numbers and we could not overcompensate that by good cost development measures and efficiency gains, which we realized in our supply chain area.\r\nWith that, moving to our -- further in our income statement adjusted now from gross profit to EBIT. You see marketing, selling and distribution expenses decreased in percentage of sales, especially to efficiency gains realized in selling and distribution expenses. After the adjustment for foreign exchange effects, we kept our absolute marketing spend for a full year. Stable, take into account that we have a number -- significant reduced number of brands, which we support as Kasper is pointing that out. So less than 300 brands, we have now in our portfolio. And on top, we spent more efficiently and strong -- and therefore strongly supporting our key brands.\r\nOverall, our clear strategy is to grow sales, increase market shares and have margins increasing. And this is the balanced why how we steer and how we develop the situation when it comes to the mix of advertising and the market conditions related to promotions.\r\nR&D expenses are at the level of 2.5% related to sales and are almost on the level of 2013. Administration expenses in absolute terms are down by 2%. With strict cost discipline and efficiency focus behind, the percentage of sales remains on the level of the year before. We have operating -- other operating income -- other operating expense balance of EUR 36 million, which is a very low level, and by that, we reached an adjusted EBIT of EUR 2,588,000,000 or a respective margin of 15.8%, which I commented before on.\r\nWith that, I would like to move now to our bridge from reported to adjusted EBIT. You see onetime gains of EUR 28 million. We have onetime charges of EUR 159 million. I would like to comment on 2 specific topics here: first, as already commented in Q3, we have been negatively impacted by expenses of EUR 100 million -- EUR 109 million for provisions related to proceedings by Anti-Trust Authorities in Europe and the proceedings are related to violations occurred between the years 2003 and 2006, so more than 10 years below; secondly, we have charges related to the setup of our global supply chain setup, the integrated global supply chain company, which were amounting of roughly EUR 40 million.\r\nMoving to our expenses regarding restructuring, in total EUR 230 million, which is above the prior year, but which is in line with the guidance we have given to you at the beginning of 2014.\r\nWith that, we come to the EUR 2.588 billion I just mentioned before in terms of adjusted EBIT for 2014.\r\nLooking at the bottom line, profit expansion is ensured in a tough environment. Why do I come to that conclusion? If you see the financial results, EUR 49 million of negative, which is an improvement of 56% or EUR 64 million compared to the prior year, and we paid taxes on income of EUR 533 million, which is related to an effective tax rate at 24%, also here in line what we, in general, see for the year and therefore we come with a net income of EUR 1,662,000,000.\r\nClosing the financials. Looking at the net financial situation, you see the minus EUR 153 million, I commented on, and there are 3 topics to be mentioned: first, we invested roughly at EUR 1.8 billion in acquisitions, which you are aware of; secondly, we paid dividends of around EUR 550 million, which is EUR 100 million more than the comparable year 2013; and we also invested more into PPE and intangible assets, roughly EUR 500 million, also EUR 100 million more than the year before.\r\nWith that, we still -- taking our A-flat rating into account, we have a financial headroom of roughly EUR 4 billion to EUR 4.5 billion. And taking a step back over the last years, you see that we have improved the situation by EUR 3.6 billion.\r\nWith that, I'm moving now to the excellence in value creation and taking 3 steps: one, on organic performance; second, on acquisitions; and third, on cash return options.\r\nLet me start with the organic performance. We are seeing a situation that we increased our capital expenditures by 19% now to a level of EUR 517 million compared to EUR 230 million, this is in line within our guidance. We significantly increased the share of investments in our emerging markets, as you can see from the chart, plus 30%. And thereof, we are spending now 1/2 of the group capital expenditures in the emerging markets and for sure then, the other 1/2 in the mature markets. The investments are focused on expansion and optimization projects, 2/3 of that. And we also, as pointed out several times before, significantly increased our investments in our IT infrastructure, which brings me to the next point because we would like to further build on our scalable business model, where IT investments are one of the major focus areas. We are focusing on best-in-class processes, IT focus and global supply chain. I will not spend so much on shared services because Kasper has already done that. We significantly increased the number of people already now to a level of more than 2,600 and we are well ahead of our plan to reach the 3,000 people, which we have foreseen for the end of 2016. And we finalized our global footprint with opening 2 shared service centers in Cairo and Shanghai.\r\nWith the IT platform, we would like to further consolidate. We are doing the second initiatives by consolidating our IT systems. We executed that in Asia. We reduced the number of ERP systems from 21 to 1 system, which is fully in operation in -- since 2014, and we started to roll out, as the majority of the rollout in Europe will start in 2015, in order to continue the execution what we have done in Asia.\r\nAnd finally, coming to our global supply chain company. Here, we have completed the blueprint. It is about further milestone in standardization and harmonization and process optimization of our processes. We would like to have an integrated setup of our global supply chain organizations of the 3 business divisions, including our purchasing activities. And we have established, at the end of 2014, our supply company in Amsterdam. And we will continue to work on these over the next years.\r\nWith that, moving to our acquisitions, a very disciplined and focused approach. Also with execution measures in 2014, EUR 1.8 billion, we spent in acquisitions on all our 3 business divisions, and by that, further strengthening our positions in attractive segments in Laundry & Home Care. Besides the brand E! in Poland, we had the major acquisition of the Spotless Group, which has a purchase price -- or an enterprise value of EUR 940 million. In the Beauty Care area, despite the acquisition of Pert in Latin America, we acquired the 3 professional hair care businesses in North America, where we spent EUR 274 million. And in Adhesive Technologies, we acquired the Bergquist company at the end of the year. And here, a clear point, where we would like to further gain technological leadership in growing markets of the electronic industry and we spent EUR 467 million on that.\r\nGoing forward, we remain committed to the acquisitions. And we will continue our disciplined and very focused approach, where we definitely have our criteria, which have not changed. That means strategic fit, financial attractiveness and availability of targets and then we will also correspondingly execute.\r\nThe last pillar, our cash return options. As already mentioned, this year, again, we will propose at the Annual General Meeting, 13th of April, that we will propose a dividend payout of roughly 30% of our adjusted net income after controlling interests. And this is in line with our change of our dividend policy, which we disclosed last year from 25% to a range of 25% to 35%. If you look on our further -- on our dividend, you'll see the 25% over the last years and in '13 and '14, the 30%, which will bring us to a dividend of EUR 131 million for the preferred shares, being up more than 7% -- 7.4%. And this translates into a total amount of dividend of EUR 569 million, and by that, an increase of EUR 40 million to the year before.\r\nWith that, I'm at the end and would like to hand back over to Kasper.\n\n---\n\nThank you very much, Carsten. Coming to the end, let me just comment on chances and opportunities in our global market, because the question I've been asked very frequently when I met with many of you in 2014. And I have chosen to comment on our 4 largest countries in the world: U.S., Germany, China and Russia. And that is the sequence of the stack. The U.S. clearly represents a huge opportunity for us moving forward. We have invested heavily in the U.S. market in 2014, not only in OpEx but also on CapEx. I mentioned in my presentation and Carsten detailed about the acquisitions we have done to not only strengthen, but also expand our position in the U.S. And clearly, we've not executed up to par. We will do that and you can rely on that. We are very, very committed to make sure that the U.S. will get back to its role within the organization as the biggest country, which is already, but also as a revenue contributor and as a EBIT gross contributor.\r\nGermany, you have to win your home games, and we have done that in the past several years also in 2014. Germany was an exceptionally good year for us in 2014, not only in terms of growth but also EBIT expansion and market share expansion. We will continue to defend and grow our home turf.\r\nChina, a lot of people have been concerned about the growth rates in China from a GDP standpoint, going to 7% or 7.2% outlook for 2015, which is very similar, by the way, to the GDP number in '14. I've been consistently, almost in the last 4 to 5 years, been asked about when do we see the slowdown in China. Of course, there is a economic slowdown. Despite that, we continue to grow double-digit in China, and China is an over proportionally profitable market for us. We also, as you know, invest ahead of time. We have 16 plants, building the 17th. We are expanding our footprint when it comes to offices, when it comes to people. We will continue to expand in China, and we continue to be bullish around China.\r\nRussia. Russia is -- or was our fourth largest country in the world, has been an exceptional success story for Henkel, and we grew very rapidly also in the past year. Of course, in nominal terms, we have been heavily impacted by the ruble. But I do want to remind all of you when I have said this in one-to-one meetings, this is the fourth crisis we're experiencing in Russia. Our experiences have been by sticking in Russia and staying the course, we have, in the long term, strengthened our market share position, and that is our position in Russia. Russia will, in the short to medium-term, be a challenge for us, but in the long term a huge opportunity. We have no change in our Russia strategy.\r\nMoving to 2014. It was overall a robust performance in a challenging and volatile environment. We delivered our key financial indicators in 2014 despite challenging markets, with very strong adverse currency. We strengthened our portfolio with high-quality assets, predominantly in mature countries, which might represent a lesser growth opportunity, but are very strong from an earnings opportunity. And with the U.S. position, I'm certain that we are not only strategically but also tactically improved our position in the U.S. We saw a solid organic sales growth driven all -- by all business groups. We saw very strong organic sales growth in the emerging markets at 7.8%, which is almost similar to previous years, despite the Russian crisis, despite the war in the Middle East, et cetera. And we saw an all-time high of our EBIT margin in high single-digit EPS growth. It is another, what we call, successful year towards our 2016 targets that we've set ourselves and we are very committed to.\r\nWe see 2015 as an ongoing challenging business environment. We expect a moderate pick-up in global GDP. According to Farrow, GDP grew 2.2% last year and it's supposed to grow 2.8% this year, so there should be an upside. We saw -- we'll see a high volatility in some key currency and crude oil prices. Some will deliver upside, dollar and dollar pegged, and also the raw materials and some will deliver a downside. And we see a persistent geopolitical change, mainly in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East.\r\nAnd now, let me say something which is extremely important, so let me try to be clear on this. As you know, Russia and Ukraine together account for about 7% of Group sales -- at Group sales level. Even if we move production, we are facing stong FX headwinds. Based on the current FX rate levels, which is pretty consistent in the last month, which is why I say current, we expect a transactional and translational impact of around EUR 100 million, negative on Group EBIT for 2015 for Russia and Ukraine together, meaning a decline over '14 of approximately EUR 100 million.\r\nPlease remember also that our total direct materials in Russia and Ukraine are highly dependent on currency movement as a large part is either sourced in euro or U.S. dollar or linked to those currencies. What I do want to stress, and that's why I'm clear, what I've just said is included in the guidance. So the EUR 100 million in Russia and in Ukraine is included in the 10% EPS guidance.\r\nMoving forward, we'll have a focused and balanced investment to foster organic and inorganic growth. We have a clear North American road map, and concrete initiatives has been underway and will show results. We have a strong innovation pipeline. At the same time, we will continue our cost focus and make sure that we adapt our structure to the market, also moving forward.\r\nAnd this leaves me now to the guidance. We expect organic sales growth of 3% to 5%, and Laundry & Home Care and Adhesives being in the same range, Beauty Care at 2%. Emerging market sales at prior level due to predominantly currency, and adjusted EBIT market around 16%. We expect an adjusted EPS growth of 10%, including what I just said about Russia and Ukraine. So I want to be very, very clear, so we don't misunderstand that, that is included in the guidance.\r\nWith this, I'm coming to the end of the presentation. We have our AGM in April. We have our first quarter numbers in May and we have our Investor Conference. And this year, it'll be with focus on Laundry & Home Care. It'll take place in Dusseldorf.\r\nAnd now, we have approximately 10 to 15 minutes -- no, 7 minutes to Q&A. So please, now switch to Q&A.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Kasper Rorsted (Executives)】\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen, here from Dusseldorf, and welcome to our conference call. First, I'd like to focus on the key developments of the fiscal year 2014, followed by an update on where we stand in terms of the execution of our strategy in 2016. Then Carsten will provide you with the financials in detail of the full year and how we created shareholder value in 2014. And after that, I will close my presentation with a brief summary for 2014 and the outlook for '15, and finally, we will be happy to take your questions.\r\nI'd like to begin by reminding everyone that the presentation, which contains the usual formal disclaimer to forward-looking statements within the meaning of relevant U.S. legislation, can be accessed via our website at henkel.com/ir. The presentation discussions are conducted subject to the disclaimer. We will not read the disclaimer, but propose we take it as read into the records for the purpose of this conference call.\r\nAnd now let's get started. We have 4 items: key developments '14; strategy progress for '16; financials '14; and extended value creation and the end summary and outlook for FY '15. And then, we'll go to the Q&A session.\r\nAlthough it was a rough -- robust performance in a challenging volatile environment, we grew our organic sales growth by 3.4%. Our adjusted EBIT margin hit an all-time high of 15.8%, adjusted earnings per share growth of 7.6%. Our free cash flow came in at EUR 1.3 billion. We invested EUR 1.8 billion in acquisitions, and our dividend payout is proposed to save 30%, but of course, with an increase relative to the earnings per share growth. We'll look at the further details on that later on.\r\nSo how do we perform against guidance? We guided our organic sales growth between 3% and 5%. We came in within the range, but the lower part of the range at 3.4%. On the emerging market sales, we expected a slight increase in nominal sales and we ended up at prior level. I don't want to stress at this point in time that we had an exceptionally strong year when we take the emerging markets condition as consideration. We grew high single-digit, and we're very happy with our overall performance in our emerging markets. The only deviation to the slight increase is currency driven. There's nothing organic that is below our expectation. Our adjusted EBIT margin, we guided at just under 16% and we came in at 15.8%. And our adjusted EPS growth, we guided high single-digit, defined as 7% to 9%. Following the second quarter, we made a revision within the range and said we'll be closer to 7% than 9%, we came out at 7.6%. We're pretty much in the middle of the range, but within -- clearly within the range of our guidance.\r\nNow let me describe how we saw the year. We see a consistent execution on our 2016 strategy, so we are doing the things we said we would do under our 4 strategic priorities and executing that very diligently.\r\nWe have conducted a high-quality set of acquisitions that will strengthen our market position in the short, as well as in the long-term. Very much in the core of what we're doing -- they're -- very market-wise, very attractive, and we believe, possesses very little risk and attractive from an earnings standpoint.\r\nWe saw a solid organic sales growth, driven by all business. And we continue to see very strong organic sales growth in the emerging markets. Carsten will speak later about that, but this is an area we are very satisfied with.\r\nOur adjusted EBIT margin hit an all-time high, driven by all business groups. And our adjusted EPS growth came in at a high-single digit. As I said, that will mean a further increase in dividend, assuming the payout ratio of 30% will be approved by the AGM, which will take place in approximately 6 weeks from now.\r\nThere are also areas that we are less concerned about. There are some macro areas, there are some  micro areas and there are some which are self-inflicted. On the macro side, we have clearly had substantial FX headwind, particularly in the first half of 2014, pretty much until August and that is now being ongoing since '13 until mid-'14. We continue to see severe geopolitical and social unrest in some of the countries we conduct business in, particularly Middle East, and despite that, we continue to deliver very strong performance, but of course, has an impact on the overall growth rate.\r\nWe are seeing the Eastern European economy being impacted by the Russian and Ukraine crisis. Ukraine and Russia is, of course, impacted. And as I've stated very clearly in every quarterly call in 2014, we are seeing a slowdown in the Eastern European economy because of this political situation.\r\nOn the macro side -- on the micro side, we've seen a further intensified price and promotion pressure on the HPC market in most markets across the board, which is an unfortunate development of the HPC market. And as I've also been clear on similar calls, North America has been clearly below our expectations in 2014. We have undertaken significant changes to ensure that that won't happen again. And we'll see when we start with pulling the numbers in '15, how that will come about. But clearly, North America was below expectations, particularly when we look upon the overall upside that economy represents.\r\nLet me move to Laundry & Home Care. We've seen, inside our organic sales growth in the past year, Laundry being solid and Homecare and some more of the specialty categories, being very strong. The mature markets, we saw Western Europe being solid despite a not very exciting economy in Western Europe and North America being negative. The emerging markets continued its double-digit growth rate in 2014. We saw adjusted EBIT margin showing a very strong increase throughout the year and ROCE was below the level of previous yeas because of number of onetime items that Carsten will be commenting on more in detail.\r\nWe also are seeing a continuous strength in our innovation pipeline. Approximately, 45% of our business in this area is done by products that has been introduced in the last 3 years. And our innovation helped us differentiate in the marketplace and also take pricing in the marketplace. That has helped to drive the top line but also the improvement on the bottom line. Vernel, which is one product I'd like to mention here, is where you're starting to see some of the trends from the Beauty Care market segments coming in to the Laundry & Home Care segments. And here, you're seeing the inclusion of oils within a detergent-related products. As you know, oils were introduced, particularly in hair products, approximately 2 to 3 years ago. A very exciting product, we patented the build of materials and the way the product has been constructed. It is implemented in a set of countries in the fourth quarter and will be fully implemented in Western and Eastern Europe by the third quarter of 2015.\r\nOn the Beauty Care side, we saw a more solid organic sales growth. Retail was solid. Hair Salon was negative -- was positive in the fourth quarter but I do not want to make any final judgments on whether the market has finally turned. On the mature markets, Western Europe continued to be positive with similar comments as I gave in the Laundry & Home Care side in North America, also here disappointing.\r\nEmerging markets continued to be strong. China, double-digit. Just to remind everybody, we are not present in China in Laundry & Home Care, which is why I didn't say -- I didn't comment on China in Laundry & Home Care. The adjusted EBIT margin continued to show solid increase and ROCE will be below previous years or it is below previous years for the same reasons as stated in Laundry & Home Care, which Carsten will comment on.\r\nAlso in this area, 45% of our sales is conducted by products which have been introduced in the last 3 years. And in 2014, we introduced Schwarzkopf Essence ULTÎME, which is a high-end hair product serials [ph]. It is noncomparable to Syoss. I want to be very clear on this. So where Syoss is a volume product, this is a high-end product with a very different margin portfolio and incremental to the market shares that we're gaining here, because in this market segment, we've not been present before. So we're very excited about the introduction of this product and it's gone according to plan in 2014.\r\nNow let me move to our biggest business group, Adhesive Technologies, where we saw a solid OSG and solid adjusted EBIT margin improvements in 2014. We saw, as I said, all -- solid organic sales growth in all businesses growing, particularly what we call our General Industry, our Loctite business, was very strong in 2014. In the mature markets, again, a similar picture, Western Europe positive, North America negative and the emerging markets are strong, China double-digit, also in the fourth quarter. We saw the adjusted EBIT margins showing solid increase, an all-time high, and also ROCE further increased.\r\nWhen it comes to our Adhesive Technology. Particularly, technology in this space, it helps us differentiate in the marketplace and drive pricing, actually, into the market place, which has been part of the reason why we've been able to take the market from 10% to above 17% in the past 6 years. In this area, we have approximately 30% of our business being conducted with products that have less than 5 years in the marketplace. This is a different factor, because simply some of the products that we introduced that customers do not want us to change them over a longer period of time. I speak about Automotive, where you have a life cycle of a car of 7 years; or Aerospace, where it's of course longer. So that's where you simply cannot change the product as quickly as in other areas simply because of the customer requirements.\r\nOne of the areas that are quite exciting is our overall Surface Treatment business, where in the past we've only delivered products. Now with some of our new products, we're also delivering total solution, so i.e., also making certain that the product is being applied to the customer product. In this area, we've had some very exciting wins, particularly in the separate [ph] markets, where we're not only delivering the product but also conducting the application of the product to the customer product. So a much more solution-driven business, which is very much in line with what we're trying to do, deliver differentiation through technology and application know-how.\r\nThat was, in highlight, how 2014 went. Now let me just review where we are in our strategy execution towards 2016. We all know our strategy built around outperform, globalize, simplify and inspire, and our 3 financial targets, 20-10-10, where our 10% EPS CAGR is our primary target towards 2016 and the one where we made substantial progress.\r\nIt's clear that we then made the progress under EUR 20 billion sales so far, simply because of one item, headwinds in currency. We expect that to change in 2015 and make a substantial step forward, but that has been the primary reason for the lack of progress on the 20. As I said, our primary guidance value is the 10% EPS CAGR.\r\nOn outperform, we are conducting a number of activities, which will continue to help us make us more competitive. On our top brands, our top 3 brands today account for EUR 5 billion and our top 10 brands from 59% of our total sales. A couple of years ago, one of the criticisms around Henkel was, we don't have any strong brands. As you can see, our top 10 brands, which account for 60% of our business, almost have a average of EUR 1 billion a piece. And that, of course, allows us to spend much more focus on marketing spend because we have fewer brands to spend on.\r\nOn innovation, I've spoken about that. It is helping us drive differentiation and it's helping, of course, drive pricing into the marketplace. And we are seeing an increase in the innovation rate across all businesses.\r\nOn our R&D centers, we stated that we would open up 7 new R&D centers in the emerging countries by 2016. We have so far opened up 5 and 2 to go, and we're very confident that we will also open up the remaining 2 and we'll report separately on that when we've done so far. But overall, we are building the infrastructure, consolidating our brands and driving innovation that will allow us to continue to what we're trying to do, grow profitably towards our 2016 targets.\r\nOn globalize, we are focusing on regions with high potentials. And this is where mature and emerging markets play 2 different roles. In the mature markets, we want to consolidate our strong market positions and increase leveraging to profitability. And we will invest to drive efficiency into this area, so we expect slower growth rates but higher profitability. We are seeing that particularly in Europe in 2014, which was an exceptionally good year.\r\nOn the emerging markets, they need to continue to drive our top line growth for the future, and of course, also over time, increase profitability. In order to do so, we are investing heavily in our emerging markets. And for the first year ever, the total amount of CapEx investments were now 50-50 between mature markets and emerging markets. So we are clearly investing for the future in the emerging markets, whether it's manufacturing, processes, systems or people.\r\nWe've also spent EUR 1.8 billion in acquisitions to strengthen our core business, moving forward. We've done, I would say, EUR 3.5 billion or EUR 4 billion on our Laundry & Home Care business. We acquired a number of brands in our core business, Laundry Additives and Insecticides in Europe to strengthen our core position in Laundry, but also it now put us into a #2 position in Insecticides in Europe. We have a strong position in the U.S., and we are market leader in Korea. And in the beginning of the year, we acquired the brand E! in Poland to strengthen our Laundry position in Poland. In our Beauty Care business, we acquired 3 brands in the U.S., which make us now #3 in the professional haircare market in the U.S. I just want to remind everybody, by 2010, we had a 0 position in the U.S. and right now, we are #3 in the U.S., so a very strong position in attractive marketplace. And in our Adhesive business, we acquired the Bergquist Company, the leader in thermal management systems, so the distribution of heat generated by processors in the electronics industry. The electronics industry can be consumer electronics, of course, business electronics or automotive or aerospace. This will help expand our position in the overall electronics market, which is very attractive, not only from a growth standpoint but also from a profitability standpoint. So we believe, we have invested actively in very attractive acquisitions, with very attractive P&Ls that will help the company moving forward, not only towards 2016 but also beyond.\r\nOn simplify, making us a better company, so driving a much more scalable business model, we now have more than 2,600 people in shared service centers. And this year, we opened Cairo and Shanghai, so we're now present globally in shared services. And we're confident towards moving towards the target of having more than 3,000 people working in shared services by 2016. We converted 45,000 employees to a new digital platform in 2014 without any disruption. We finalized the rollout of SAP horizon in Asia and are now starting to -- starting the implementation work in Europe without any business disruption, which is not self-explanatory. A lot of companies are suffering in this area. We had a very successful rollout.\r\nAnd we created our global supply chain company, set up in Amsterdam. And we're looking for further sourcing hubs for the future that will allow our global supply chain to operate more efficiently. Overall, we are building a scalable business model.\r\nBut most importantly, we'll continue to strengthen our global management team. There is no doubt that the core reason why we've been able to consistently improve our performance has been through good and solid execution done globally by good leadership. And we are working effectively with Harvard Business School to ensure that our top 200 leaders are trained by trainers, so to speak, a co-development program between Henkel and Harvard that ensures that our senior leaders across the company knows what is expected from them from a cultural standpoint, but also from a performance standpoint. We are a performance-driven company.\r\nOn talent and performance. We continue to conduct our, what we call, Development Round Table, where we're steckling [ph] our people to ensure that we treat people fairly but differently. We want to make sure that the top performers get top attention within our company and performance is recognized. And that allows us also to promote more than 1,000 people internally. Internal promotion is a high priority for us under the assumption that the performance is appropriate and the compliance to our values is in order.\r\nDiversity, the last point. 33% of our managers are women, but even more important, we have a global work force. We have today, in our top managers, Chinese, Arabs, Russians, Americans, Latin Americans, and that is what truly characterizes a global company. We do not want to be a global-managed company. We are a global company, globally headquartered in Germany, but we want to have a global management team. And we made substantial progress on this, where in most regions, the regions are run by strong local leaders.\r\nNow I'd like to hand over to Carsten, who will take us through the financials in detail for 2014. Carsten, please?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Carsten Knobel (Executives)】\nThank you very much, Kasper. Good morning to everyone. Let's have a now look on our financials for the full year 2014 in more detail. And let's start, as always, with an overview of our key performance indicators and starting here with our sales performance. In 2014, our sales accounted for EUR 16,428,000,000. This is showing a slight increase in nominal terms of 40 basis points due to negative FX effect amounting to 4.0%. Organically, we could increase, again with a solid organic net sales growth, our numbers by 3.4%, supported by all our 3 business divisions.\r\nOur gross margin -- adjusted gross margin came in at 47.5%. This is 50 basis points below the prior year with 48.0%. So with the growth gross margin of 48%, the year 2013 represented a tough and high comparable. If you would compare the 47.5% to the year 2012, this would represent an increase of 40 basis points.\r\nComing now to our adjusted EBIT margin. Our adjusted EBIT margin could be increased for the year 2014 by 40 basis points, now to an all-time high in terms of margin of 15.8%, and by that, representing a strong result, supported by all 3 business divisions.\r\nBefore I now continue with the EPS, let me step back for a moment and comment on the Q4 adjusted EBIT margin of the quarter. This is below the prior year of 60 basis points and there are 3 major reasons behind: first of all, I think you all know that we acquired significantly in the year 2014 and the closing of the majority of the acquisition was in the second half, being more precise even in the quarter 4 of the year. And by that, you can imagine that we have taken integration costs but also inventory step-ups, which are related to IFRS [ph] requirements into -- directly into account, which affected the Q4 2014. But also to be clear, these are onetime effects, which will not occur going into 2015. The second reason behind is the crisis, which you're also aware, in Russia and Ukraine. Besides the translational impact which we face, we have also significant transactional impacts in Russia and in Ukraine hitting our gross margin and by that also hitting our EBIT, and by that, impacting also the margin. And the third point is, we have increased our marketing spend in our fast-moving consumer businesses on a quarter-to-quarter comparison Q4 to Q4 of last year. So these are the 3 main reasons why you see a 60 basis point decline in the Q4 margins. Especially the number, the second reason which I alluded to, the situation in Russia and Ukraine, is something which is not a onetime effect, which will continue definitely also, which we will see in the first half of the year 2015 because the crisis started in the second half of 2014.\r\nWith that, let me come back with the experts [ph] and come now to our adjusted EPS, development of our preferred shares, we reached EUR 4.38, which is an increase of 7.6%, and by that, hitting our high single-digit guidance for EPS in the year 2014, even if it is at the lower end of the range as we indicated it already in Q3 release. So overall, a robust performance and another year of profitable growth.\r\nLet me now come to our cash situation, and here, focusing first on our net working capital development. Net working capital came in at a good level of 4.2%, which is up versus the prior year of 190 basis points, but definitely as a -- on a satisfying level. Please consider, also here, the topic of the recent acquisitions which we did, they have not the same level of net working capital as we are used to, so this has an impact of roughly 70 basis points. And on top, we are also attributable to negative currency effects of roughly 50 basis points. If you add these 2 components, it's 120 basis points. And if you see that, then you would have a like-for-like comparison of roughly 3.0% of net working capital. And if I could remind you on what I said last year, we see our net working capital on a level between 3% and 3.5%. That's the reason why we see this number of 4.2% on the satisfying level for 2014. Nevertheless, we will not give up to further improve net working capital also in the coming years.\r\nComing now to our free cash flow development. We reached the free cash flow of EUR 1,333,000,000, which is in line with the average over the last 6 years, which we take as a reference period since 2008. For sure, this is below the previous year with EUR 1.6 billion, which was an all-time high when it comes to free cash flow.\r\nWith that, let me move now to our net financial position. The net financial position at the end of 2014 reached a level of minus EUR 153 million considering the increased dividend payout, which we had in 2014 and the recent acquisitions of EUR 1.8 billion, which we spent. A remarkable result. So we used also here our cash in a very disciplined way.\r\nAfter this overview, let me now go into the details of the KPIs and starting with our sales situation. As I mentioned before, our sales came in organically with a solid development of 3.4% for the year, and this is split by 40 basis points of price increases or price development and 300 basis points of volume development.\r\nAs anticipated, in 2014, we continued to face a headwind with foreign exchange with 400 basis point, as I mentioned before, the absolute amount is, in that terms, EUR 650 million, and especially, decreasing or depreciation of emerging market currency contributed the majority of that part. And even be more precise, Russia and Ukraine, these 2 countries amount for 1/3 of this EUR 650 million of FX effect.\r\nM&A. The net effect of M&A contributed plus 1.0%. So in total, we reached EUR 16,428,000,000, showing a slight nominal increase as pointed out before of 40 basis points.\r\nHaving now a look on our situation in the emerging markets and the mature markets. You heard already Kasper pointing that out. We were -- have been very satisfied with our development in the emerging markets. We could, again, show a strong organic net sales growth of 7.8%, reaching EUR 7,249,000,000 in absolute terms. And also, our situation in the mature markets was slightly positive with 0.2%, especially with a very satisfying performance in Western Europe.\r\nThe emerging markets now account for 44% of our total sales, despite the FX headwinds. This is a stable situation compared to the prior year. If we would adjust for FX, so for the same level as of last year, we would have increased the emerging market level to 46%.\r\nWith that, I would like to now go into the details of the region and give you a glance of how we have been developing here. And first of all, overall statement, all regions show organic growth besides or except North America. Starting with Western Europe. Western Europe in total amounts for 35% of our total sales. And as you can see, we have increased organically the situation by 1.7%. This is, as I said before, supported by a very good performance in Germany across all business units. But it's also noteworthy to mention that also, in Southern Europe, all major countries showing positive developments besides one country, which is Italy. Italy is still negative in terms of organic net sales development.\r\nComing now to Eastern Europe. Similar to Q3, we see a counterintuitively sales development in Eastern Europe. Eastern Europe is amounting for 70% -- 17% of our sales and we have a polarized situation. We have, in total, an organic net sales growth of 4.5% by Russia, showing a very strong development in terms of organic development, while Ukraine and some other countries are negative.\r\nMoving now to Africa/Middle East. Africa/Middle East, again, in 2014 showed a double-digit development plus 16.9% in terms of organic net sales and development. Coming now to North America, amounting for 18% of our sales. Organic sales remained below the prior year. Our consumer businesses, Laundry & Home Care and Beauty Care, were both impacted by an intense, promotional and price competition, but also our execution was also not always optimal, and by that, impacting our business negatively. The situation in our Adhesive Technology business in North America is different. Here, we are affected by portfolio optimization measures. That means we are deemphasizing our commoditized businesses, especially in the area of packaging -- adhesive packaging and consumer goods.\r\nWith that, I would like to move to Latin America. Latin America amounts for 6% of our total sales, shows solid development in organic net sales growth of 4.4%, with a strong development in Mexico and a flat development in Brazil, especially impacted by the weak development of the market.\r\nFinally, Asia-Pacific. Again, also here, a very strong sales performance, plus 8.2% in terms of organic terms and this was especially driven, as Kasper has pointed it out before, by a double-digit development in China, but also strong development of India.\r\nWith that -- well, let me finalize the situation in terms of commenting on our BRIC situation. I have done it more or less by summarizing it. BRIC, a very good development, double-digit in China, very strong in Russia and India, and the only one was flat is Brazil.\r\nWith that, I would like to move to our 3 divisions, and starting now with Laundry & Home Care. Laundry & Home Care amounts for 28% of our total sales of the company, showed an organic growth of 4.6%, driven by volume of 5.1%, and by that, overcompensating a negative pricing effect of 50 basis points. And the 2 businesses, Kasper mentioned it, Laundry showed a solid organic net sales growth while the Home Care business were very strong in terms of growing organically.\r\nThe emerging market, again, in 2014, showed double-digit development with Eastern Europe and a solid development, while Asia-Pacific and Latin America both were very strong, and Africa/Middle East in a double-digit development.\r\nMature markets remained below the prior year. We had a good development in Western Europe, supported by a good development of Germany, but that could not fully compensate the situation you're aware of in North America where we have a negative development due to a fierce promotional environment and on top of declining markets in 2014.\r\nBottom line situation. Adjusted EBIT margin, again, could be increased by 60 basis points on a full year basis now to a level of 16.2%, this is an all-time high. Also if we give you now a longer perspective, since 2008, we have improved the adjusted EBIT margin in Laundry & Home Care by 450 basis points since 2012. This development shows an increase of 240 basis points.\r\nFinalizing the situation in Laundry & Home Care with a look on net working capital. We show, here also, a very good number of minus 6.6%. This is above the prior year of 140 basis points. But if you consider, also here, the M&A effect, which amounts to 70 basis points, we are quite satisfied with the development also on that level.\r\nMoving now to Beauty Care. Beauty Care now showed a 9th year of consecutive profitable growth, showing an organic net sales growth of 2.0%, driven exclusively by volume, so the price component was flat. The retail business showed a solid organic net sales growth and our Hair Salon business is still characterized by a market decline in the mature markets. And as you know, the mature markets are the majority of our sales, so sales therefore showed a negative development. But also commenting again on that, as Kasper said it, the Q4 of professional was positive in terms of OSG.\r\nThe emerging market grew strongly with a double-digit contribution in the emerging Asia region and here with a double-digit development of China. Africa/Middle East and Latin America showed growth -- strong growth rates. Mature markets could not be maintained on the prior year level. We have a similar situation, like in Laundry, we have a very good development in our Western European countries, which could not fully compensate the situation in North America with a similar reason as pointed out in Laundry & Home Care.\r\nComing also now to the bottom line of Beauty Care. We have seen an increase of our adjusted EBIT margin in 2014 of 30 basis points bringing us to a level of 15.3%. Also here, the comparison on a long-term basis, since 2008, we increased the margin by 270 basis points, or respectively, since 2012 of 80 basis points.\r\nNet working capital is, also here, on a very good level of 1.3%, being up 180 basis points. Here are 2 effects, which are remarkable on the one side also, the FX from acquisitions, which amount to 80 basis points, but here, we have also a fixed FX of roughly 60 basis points, so in total, 140 basis points on a -- to make it like-for-like.\r\nWith that, moving now to our Adhesive Technology division. And also stating here, we have 49% of our sales in the total group which are amounting -- or representable for Adhesives, we have seen a solid organic net sales growth of 3.7%, which are a balanced mix of volume and price. To be precise, 270 basis points is volume, 100 basis points is price.\r\nAll segments contributed to that development, especially General Industry segment showed a strong -- or very strong organic net sales growth. All other segments had a solid development when it comes to OSG.\r\nEmerging markets, especially here, a strong development with Russia and China being double-digit, but also strong developments from Mexico and India. Mature markets recorded a positive organic net sales growth, here again, the strong development or a good development in Western Europe and mature Asia could overcompensate the slight negative development in North America.\r\nBottom line, adjusted EBIT margin is up 30 basis points to an all-time high level of 17.2%. And if you also look here, historically back, we have increased since 2008, 710 basis points, the adjusted EBIT margin in Adhesives, and since 2012 of 210 basis points.\r\nNet working capital is at the level of 12.2%, also here, impacted by FX and acquisition. FX amounts for 60 basis points -- sorry, acquisition amounts for 60 basis points while FX amounts for 90, so in total, 150 basis points in order to come to a like-for-like comparison so there we would be up only 70 basis points. So very satisfied also here with net working capital.\r\nWith that, I move -- would like to move further in our income statement adjustment and starting with gross margins or from sales to gross margins. I have commented on the sales development of EUR 16.428 million. We have a gross profit of EUR 7,798,000,000, which is down compared to the prior year of minus 0.8%. That brings our margin to 50 basis points reduction compared to the prior year. I already commented on, that the prior year was a high comparable and that we are 50 basis points down, but compared to 2012, we are 40 basis points up. So especially here, increase in our raw material costs as one item and also the high promotional intensity could -- were affecting our 2014 numbers and we could not overcompensate that by good cost development measures and efficiency gains, which we realized in our supply chain area.\r\nWith that, moving to our -- further in our income statement adjusted now from gross profit to EBIT. You see marketing, selling and distribution expenses decreased in percentage of sales, especially to efficiency gains realized in selling and distribution expenses. After the adjustment for foreign exchange effects, we kept our absolute marketing spend for a full year. Stable, take into account that we have a number -- significant reduced number of brands, which we support as Kasper is pointing that out. So less than 300 brands, we have now in our portfolio. And on top, we spent more efficiently and strong -- and therefore strongly supporting our key brands.\r\nOverall, our clear strategy is to grow sales, increase market shares and have margins increasing. And this is the balanced why how we steer and how we develop the situation when it comes to the mix of advertising and the market conditions related to promotions.\r\nR&D expenses are at the level of 2.5% related to sales and are almost on the level of 2013. Administration expenses in absolute terms are down by 2%. With strict cost discipline and efficiency focus behind, the percentage of sales remains on the level of the year before. We have operating -- other operating income -- other operating expense balance of EUR 36 million, which is a very low level, and by that, we reached an adjusted EBIT of EUR 2,588,000,000 or a respective margin of 15.8%, which I commented before on.\r\nWith that, I would like to move now to our bridge from reported to adjusted EBIT. You see onetime gains of EUR 28 million. We have onetime charges of EUR 159 million. I would like to comment on 2 specific topics here: first, as already commented in Q3, we have been negatively impacted by expenses of EUR 100 million -- EUR 109 million for provisions related to proceedings by Anti-Trust Authorities in Europe and the proceedings are related to violations occurred between the years 2003 and 2006, so more than 10 years below; secondly, we have charges related to the setup of our global supply chain setup, the integrated global supply chain company, which were amounting of roughly EUR 40 million.\r\nMoving to our expenses regarding restructuring, in total EUR 230 million, which is above the prior year, but which is in line with the guidance we have given to you at the beginning of 2014.\r\nWith that, we come to the EUR 2.588 billion I just mentioned before in terms of adjusted EBIT for 2014.\r\nLooking at the bottom line, profit expansion is ensured in a tough environment. Why do I come to that conclusion? If you see the financial results, EUR 49 million of negative, which is an improvement of 56% or EUR 64 million compared to the prior year, and we paid taxes on income of EUR 533 million, which is related to an effective tax rate at 24%, also here in line what we, in general, see for the year and therefore we come with a net income of EUR 1,662,000,000.\r\nClosing the financials. Looking at the net financial situation, you see the minus EUR 153 million, I commented on, and there are 3 topics to be mentioned: first, we invested roughly at EUR 1.8 billion in acquisitions, which you are aware of; secondly, we paid dividends of around EUR 550 million, which is EUR 100 million more than the comparable year 2013; and we also invested more into PPE and intangible assets, roughly EUR 500 million, also EUR 100 million more than the year before.\r\nWith that, we still -- taking our A-flat rating into account, we have a financial headroom of roughly EUR 4 billion to EUR 4.5 billion. And taking a step back over the last years, you see that we have improved the situation by EUR 3.6 billion.\r\nWith that, I'm moving now to the excellence in value creation and taking 3 steps: one, on organic performance; second, on acquisitions; and third, on cash return options.\r\nLet me start with the organic performance. We are seeing a situation that we increased our capital expenditures by 19% now to a level of EUR 517 million compared to EUR 230 million, this is in line within our guidance. We significantly increased the share of investments in our emerging markets, as you can see from the chart, plus 30%. And thereof, we are spending now 1/2 of the group capital expenditures in the emerging markets and for sure then, the other 1/2 in the mature markets. The investments are focused on expansion and optimization projects, 2/3 of that. And we also, as pointed out several times before, significantly increased our investments in our IT infrastructure, which brings me to the next point because we would like to further build on our scalable business model, where IT investments are one of the major focus areas. We are focusing on best-in-class processes, IT focus and global supply chain. I will not spend so much on shared services because Kasper has already done that. We significantly increased the number of people already now to a level of more than 2,600 and we are well ahead of our plan to reach the 3,000 people, which we have foreseen for the end of 2016. And we finalized our global footprint with opening 2 shared service centers in Cairo and Shanghai.\r\nWith the IT platform, we would like to further consolidate. We are doing the second initiatives by consolidating our IT systems. We executed that in Asia. We reduced the number of ERP systems from 21 to 1 system, which is fully in operation in -- since 2014, and we started to roll out, as the majority of the rollout in Europe will start in 2015, in order to continue the execution what we have done in Asia.\r\nAnd finally, coming to our global supply chain company. Here, we have completed the blueprint. It is about further milestone in standardization and harmonization and process optimization of our processes. We would like to have an integrated setup of our global supply chain organizations of the 3 business divisions, including our purchasing activities. And we have established, at the end of 2014, our supply company in Amsterdam. And we will continue to work on these over the next years.\r\nWith that, moving to our acquisitions, a very disciplined and focused approach. Also with execution measures in 2014, EUR 1.8 billion, we spent in acquisitions on all our 3 business divisions, and by that, further strengthening our positions in attractive segments in Laundry & Home Care. Besides the brand E! in Poland, we had the major acquisition of the Spotless Group, which has a purchase price -- or an enterprise value of EUR 940 million. In the Beauty Care area, despite the acquisition of Pert in Latin America, we acquired the 3 professional hair care businesses in North America, where we spent EUR 274 million. And in Adhesive Technologies, we acquired the Bergquist company at the end of the year. And here, a clear point, where we would like to further gain technological leadership in growing markets of the electronic industry and we spent EUR 467 million on that.\r\nGoing forward, we remain committed to the acquisitions. And we will continue our disciplined and very focused approach, where we definitely have our criteria, which have not changed. That means strategic fit, financial attractiveness and availability of targets and then we will also correspondingly execute.\r\nThe last pillar, our cash return options. As already mentioned, this year, again, we will propose at the Annual General Meeting, 13th of April, that we will propose a dividend payout of roughly 30% of our adjusted net income after controlling interests. And this is in line with our change of our dividend policy, which we disclosed last year from 25% to a range of 25% to 35%. If you look on our further -- on our dividend, you'll see the 25% over the last years and in '13 and '14, the 30%, which will bring us to a dividend of EUR 131 million for the preferred shares, being up more than 7% -- 7.4%. And this translates into a total amount of dividend of EUR 569 million, and by that, an increase of EUR 40 million to the year before.\r\nWith that, I'm at the end and would like to hand back over to Kasper.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Kasper Rorsted (Executives)】\nThank you very much, Carsten. Coming to the end, let me just comment on chances and opportunities in our global market, because the question I've been asked very frequently when I met with many of you in 2014. And I have chosen to comment on our 4 largest countries in the world: U.S., Germany, China and Russia. And that is the sequence of the stack. The U.S. clearly represents a huge opportunity for us moving forward. We have invested heavily in the U.S. market in 2014, not only in OpEx but also on CapEx. I mentioned in my presentation and Carsten detailed about the acquisitions we have done to not only strengthen, but also expand our position in the U.S. And clearly, we've not executed up to par. We will do that and you can rely on that. We are very, very committed to make sure that the U.S. will get back to its role within the organization as the biggest country, which is already, but also as a revenue contributor and as a EBIT gross contributor.\r\nGermany, you have to win your home games, and we have done that in the past several years also in 2014. Germany was an exceptionally good year for us in 2014, not only in terms of growth but also EBIT expansion and market share expansion. We will continue to defend and grow our home turf.\r\nChina, a lot of people have been concerned about the growth rates in China from a GDP standpoint, going to 7% or 7.2% outlook for 2015, which is very similar, by the way, to the GDP number in '14. I've been consistently, almost in the last 4 to 5 years, been asked about when do we see the slowdown in China. Of course, there is a economic slowdown. Despite that, we continue to grow double-digit in China, and China is an over proportionally profitable market for us. We also, as you know, invest ahead of time. We have 16 plants, building the 17th. We are expanding our footprint when it comes to offices, when it comes to people. We will continue to expand in China, and we continue to be bullish around China.\r\nRussia. Russia is -- or was our fourth largest country in the world, has been an exceptional success story for Henkel, and we grew very rapidly also in the past year. Of course, in nominal terms, we have been heavily impacted by the ruble. But I do want to remind all of you when I have said this in one-to-one meetings, this is the fourth crisis we're experiencing in Russia. Our experiences have been by sticking in Russia and staying the course, we have, in the long term, strengthened our market share position, and that is our position in Russia. Russia will, in the short to medium-term, be a challenge for us, but in the long term a huge opportunity. We have no change in our Russia strategy.\r\nMoving to 2014. It was overall a robust performance in a challenging and volatile environment. We delivered our key financial indicators in 2014 despite challenging markets, with very strong adverse currency. We strengthened our portfolio with high-quality assets, predominantly in mature countries, which might represent a lesser growth opportunity, but are very strong from an earnings opportunity. And with the U.S. position, I'm certain that we are not only strategically but also tactically improved our position in the U.S. We saw a solid organic sales growth driven all -- by all business groups. We saw very strong organic sales growth in the emerging markets at 7.8%, which is almost similar to previous years, despite the Russian crisis, despite the war in the Middle East, et cetera. And we saw an all-time high of our EBIT margin in high single-digit EPS growth. It is another, what we call, successful year towards our 2016 targets that we've set ourselves and we are very committed to.\r\nWe see 2015 as an ongoing challenging business environment. We expect a moderate pick-up in global GDP. According to Farrow, GDP grew 2.2% last year and it's supposed to grow 2.8% this year, so there should be an upside. We saw -- we'll see a high volatility in some key currency and crude oil prices. Some will deliver upside, dollar and dollar pegged, and also the raw materials and some will deliver a downside. And we see a persistent geopolitical change, mainly in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East.\r\nAnd now, let me say something which is extremely important, so let me try to be clear on this. As you know, Russia and Ukraine together account for about 7% of Group sales -- at Group sales level. Even if we move production, we are facing stong FX headwinds. Based on the current FX rate levels, which is pretty consistent in the last month, which is why I say current, we expect a transactional and translational impact of around EUR 100 million, negative on Group EBIT for 2015 for Russia and Ukraine together, meaning a decline over '14 of approximately EUR 100 million.\r\nPlease remember also that our total direct materials in Russia and Ukraine are highly dependent on currency movement as a large part is either sourced in euro or U.S. dollar or linked to those currencies. What I do want to stress, and that's why I'm clear, what I've just said is included in the guidance. So the EUR 100 million in Russia and in Ukraine is included in the 10% EPS guidance.\r\nMoving forward, we'll have a focused and balanced investment to foster organic and inorganic growth. We have a clear North American road map, and concrete initiatives has been underway and will show results. We have a strong innovation pipeline. At the same time, we will continue our cost focus and make sure that we adapt our structure to the market, also moving forward.\r\nAnd this leaves me now to the guidance. We expect organic sales growth of 3% to 5%, and Laundry & Home Care and Adhesives being in the same range, Beauty Care at 2%. Emerging market sales at prior level due to predominantly currency, and adjusted EBIT market around 16%. We expect an adjusted EPS growth of 10%, including what I just said about Russia and Ukraine. So I want to be very, very clear, so we don't misunderstand that, that is included in the guidance.\r\nWith this, I'm coming to the end of the presentation. We have our AGM in April. We have our first quarter numbers in May and we have our Investor Conference. And this year, it'll be with focus on Laundry & Home Care. It'll take place in Dusseldorf.\r\nAnd now, we have approximately 10 to 15 minutes -- no, 7 minutes to Q&A. So please, now switch to Q&A.",
      "transcript_text3": "My first question will be on trying to understand better the Q4 EBIT margin performance because you flagged [indiscernible]?\n\n---\n\nI can't hear what you're saying.\r\n[Technical Difficulty]\n\n---\n\nI was wondering if you could talk a bit more about the promotional environment in the U.S. at the moment and the HPC markets? I know it's something you've been saying for a while as a big focus for your management team, but I was wondering if you could give us some more color on the significant changes that you mentioned, that you are taking to confront the issues, and whether you -- whether or not you expect the nature of intensified promotions and pricing pressure to change over the course of 2015?\n\n---\n\nWe do not expect a significant change in the promotional activity in the U.S. We expect, potentially, a slight slowdown, but not any significant change. And we believe that basically we can counteract that is through bringing new and more innovate products into the market. And we believe we have a stronger price innovation pipeline in 2015, but no significant change to the promotional activity in the U.S. in '15.\n\n---\n\nMy first question will be on Eastern Europe, where you have a good acceleration in Q4. Can you talk about your pricing policy in this region, and particularly, in Russia? So can we expect a slowdown in Q1 after the very strong Q4? My second question will be on the EBIT margin expectation of around 16%. Do you think you are groomed to increase the margin of all divisions in 2015?\n\n---\n\nI'll do the first, then Carsten will do the second. Overall, on pricing, we do, of course, see in high inflationary countries that there's room for more pricing. We expect an ongoing pricing going on in Russia in 2015, but the pricing will not be able to offset the currency devaluation that we have seen. So that is a stepwise approach. In Europe, it's a different environment, you have slight pricing going on, but very slight. You're in a pretty much deflationary environment in Western Europe. Carsten, on the margin?\n\n---\n\nYes. Kasper pointed out the guidance for 2015, which is around 16%, and this is driven by all 3 business divisions. So all 3 business divisions will support the increase of our margin.\n\n---\n\nI have 2 questions. The first one on the administrative -- sorry, the A&P cost that has increased in Q4. Can you, I mean, because this is an area where you had been able to lower the A&P because you had said that you had invested more in the promotional side. So are we now at the point where you feel that you need to increase the A&P and should we expect that to be the case for 2015? My second question is on the gross margin. You said that 2014 was impacted by raw material prices. Can you shed light on the road map [ph]? I've seen that you said flat road map guidance. That sounds a bit surprising given the -- how the oil prices have moved. So if you could shed light on that and whether we could expect gross margin to grow again in 2015?\n\n---\n\nSo to the point of marketing spend, I think I used the term of marketing spend especially to explain the reduction of our adjusted EBIT margin in the fourth quarter. We are not guiding -- or we are not looking on quarters when it comes to spendings, we're looking on overall years. And here, I was also clear in the presentation that I've said, we spend FX adjusted roughly the same amount in absolute terms in marketing as the year before, and there is also no change foreseen for the future. One thing is clear, one thing will stay the same, this is the promotion, a level at a very high level. This, for sure, has over the last year, changed also the mix in total, but overall, the situation will not significantly change. That's the first thing. And your question regarding the gross margins. For sure, it is right that the oil prices have gone down significantly, but important is that it takes 3 to 6 months until the things can -- will come through our P&L. Kasper has also alluded on that. For sure, we will take that into account that this will have an impact on our gross margin, but there are a lot of factors, which are impacting our margin. And therefore, this is something where we're not guiding on the gross margin per se, but for sure, the oil will positively impact us.\n\n---\n\nTwo questions. First of all, just back to that -- back regarding the raw material question. Can you put any numbers on that? If oil/the oil derivatives stayed where they were, what's kind of relief would you see for 2015 in terms of absolute numbers? And second of all, looking at the regions, you had a massive EBIT increase in Q4 in Asia-Pacific by, I believe, plus 46%, if my calculation is correct. After a rather weak development at the 9-month level, what is behind that?\n\n---\n\nOn the first one, the comment is no. We don't comment on it. And on the second, we're very happy to come back to you on that. That is simply -- that is not, by default, a, what do you call, a one-to-one comparison. There's probably onetime items, and we we'll get back to you on that. I can't answer it on the fly, so to speak. We'll get back to you.\n\n---\n\nTwo quick questions. Firstly, could you quantify the impact from acquisitions on the margins in Q4? You did flag it out as being one of the reasons for them being down. And then secondly, on acquisitions, you also mentioned that they were impact -- negatively impacting your working capital development. Do you expect that also to be a drag for your working capital in 2015?\n\n---\n\nSo to your first questions, I could, but we are not disclosing these numbers. And for the second point, I think we have proven over the last years that we are very strong in developing our net working capital and that's for sure now the task of the operated businesses in Laundry, in Beauty Care and in Adhesives to take the measures we have taken into our organization and also to integrate that in the way how we deal in these 3 now integrated businesses and how long this will take, I cannot comment on. This will be shown over the next quarters. But for sure, we are very -- we know exactly what we need to do and therefore we will also drive that in that direction where Henkel has been before.\n\n---\n\nAnd last question please.\n\n---\n\nSo 2 questions for me. Firstly, U.S. Laundry. It's been a while since we've heard anything about a big, sort of, Purex innovation and that's clearly a bit business that's been struggling. Does U.S. Laundry need a stronger innovation pipeline and is that part of the changes? And then secondly, just on professional hair care. You called out how you're now the #3 in U.S. professional hair care. How do you feel about professional hair care as a cash accretive [ph], it's clearly been slow in recent years but is it still somewhere that you see as being structurally attractive?\n\n---\n\nOn a -- on the innovation in the U.S., I was very clear on that we needed a stronger innovation pipeline. We believe we have that and you can see that throughout the year on some of the Purex products that will come into market. So we are confident that we have an appropriate pipeline when it comes to Laundry in the U.S. Overall, the reason why -- question 1. Question 2, on professional hair care, it is an attractive category, predominantly because most of the innovation that takes place related to hair coloration takes place in the professional side. And hair coloration has an over-proportionally high margin, which is why it's very attractive. It has been a category that has been characterized by negative growth in probably the last 2 to 3 years. But we believe, over time, it will return back to growth. But it is really the key. If you want to be the leader in hair coloration in retail, it is a pre-assumption or prerequisite to also be in professional hair care. And that's why, I believe, it's a very attractive market to be in from a margin standpoint. And it will grow over time. It's had a very difficult period as a category in the last 3 years.\r\nWith this, I'd like to come to a close, and thank everybody for dialing in today. Within a challenging environment, characterized by high volatility, political tensions and persistent high-promotion pressure, we have delivered a robust performance in 2014. Looking ahead at 2015, it seems to be a year with exciting opportunities, but also several challenges. However, we're confident and thanks to our innovative strength and strong brands, coupled with a continuous adaption of our structure to the market and by further driving operational excellence, we will continue throughout '15 to outperform in '15 and beyond. That's why, we believe, the 10% EPS target is an appropriate target. I wish you all the best and look forward to talking to you on May 7, 2015, for the first quarter.\r\nAnd before I close, I'd like, again, to remind you of our Investor and Analyst conference, hosted by Bruno Piacenza and his team of the Laundry & Home Care business unit. It will take place Monday, June 1, 2015, here in Dusseldorf. The invitation including agenda and further details will follow soon, but please save the date.\r\nThank you very much, and thank you for dialing in today.",

If you want to be the leader in hair coloration in retail, it is a pre-assumption or prerequisite to also be in professional hair care. And that's why, I believe, it's a very attractive market to be in from a margin standpoint. And it will grow over time. It's had a very difficult period as a category in the last 3 years.\r\nWith this, I'd like to come to a close, and thank everybody for dialing in today. Within a challenging environment, characterized by high volatility, political tensions and persistent high-promotion pressure, we have delivered a robust performance in 2014. Looking ahead at 2015, it seems to be a year with exciting opportunities, but also several challenges. However, we're confident and thanks to our innovative strength and strong brands, coupled with a continuous adaption of our structure to the market and by further driving operational excellence, we will continue throughout '15 to outperform in '15 and beyond. That's why, we believe, the 10% EPS target is an appropriate target. I wish you all the best and look forward to talking to you on May 7, 2015, for the first quarter.\r\nAnd before I close, I'd like, again, to remind you of our Investor and Analyst conference, hosted by Bruno Piacenza and his team of the Laundry & Home Care business unit. It will take place Monday, June 1, 2015, here in Dusseldorf. The invitation including agenda and further details will follow soon, but please save the date.\r\nThank you very much, and thank you for dialing in today.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you. Welcome to this telephone conference on occasion of H&M's first quarter results 2015. Our CFO, Jyrki Tervonen, is with me today, and we'll be happy to answer your questions after the presentation. You'll find the presentation slides to this telephone conference on hm.com.\r\nPlease look at the slide First Quarter 2015. We had a very good start of 2015 with a strong first quarter, both in terms of sales and results. Collections from all group brands have been well received with an attractive customer offering and global expansion with stores and online. We have increased our market share and strengthened H&M's position further.\r\nPlease turn to the slide Sales. Market conditions for fashion retail in the first quarter remained characterized by a challenging macroeconomic situation in many places. In this environment, H&M continued to perform well. Sales, including VAT, increased by 15% in local currency and 25% in SEK, amounting to SEK 46.8 billion.\r\nLooking at the development in some of H&M's largest markets, please turn to the slide Sales Per Market. In Germany, which is the group's single largest market, H&M's sales developed well despite weak market statistics. Sales were up 5% in euro and 12% in SEK. In H&M's second-largest market, the U.S., sales were very strong. In local currencies, the increase was 28% and 57% in SEK. The U.K. kept developing well. Sales increased by 17% in sterling and 34% in SEK. In China, H&M's rapid growth continues. Sales grew by 28% in local currencies and 54% in SEK. China is now the fifth-largest market of H&M group. So overall, a very good sales performance.\r\nAnd now to look at results, please turn to the next slide. Gross profit in the first quarter increased by 26% corresponding to a gross margin of 55.2% compared to 54.9% a year earlier. Markdowns in relation to sales decreased by 30 basis points compared to the first quarter last year. And looking at some external factors, such as raw material prices, cost inflation, supplier capacity, purchase in currencies and transportation costs, combined, the market situation for these factors was slightly negative compared to the corresponding purchasing period the year before, mainly as a result of the increased cost inflation.\r\nPlease turn to the slide SG&A. Cost control in the group remained good. In the first quarter, SG&A increased by 23% in SEK and 14% in local currencies. The increase is mainly related to the expansion and to the continued long-term investment in IT and online and the broadening of the product range.\r\nTo look at profit, please turn to the next slide. Profit after financial items increased by 35% to more than $4.7 billion. The increase is mainly due to strong sales and good cost control but also to positive currency translation effects. Profit after financial items has been negatively affected by cost of our long-term investments in, for example, IT and online. These costs were higher in the first quarter of 2015 compared with the corresponding quarter last year.\r\nPlease turn to the next slide. After tax rate of 23.5%, net profit increased to SEK 3.6 billion. Earnings per share increased by 36% to SEK 2.18 from SEK 1.60.\r\nAnd now for some more key figures, please turn to the slide Key Data. Stock-in-trade as of the 28th of February amounted to SEK 20.3 billion, an increase of 28% in SEK and 23% in local currencies. The increase is mainly due to the store and online expansion and also to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which has affected purchasing costs, and as a consequence, the value of the stock-in-trade. As a share of sales, stock-in-trade was 12.7% compared to 12% in the previous year. The composition and the level of stock-in-trade are considered good.\r\nCash flow from current operations was SEK 4.9 billion, up from SEK 2.7 billion. The main explanation for the increase is the strong result. Investments in terms of CapEx totaled SEK 2.2 billion, an increase from SEK 1.6 billion. The increase is mainly a reflection of the strong expansion in stores and online. For 2015, CapEx is expected to reach approximately SEK 11 billion to SEK 11.5 billion. The financial position of the H&M group remained strong and liquid funds increased to SEK 20 billion from SEK 18.2 billion. The return on equity was 40.1%.\r\nAnd now some words on expansion. Please turn to the slide Store Expansion 2015. H&M has a strong global presence with 3,551 stores in 57 markets, 6 fashion brands and sales online. In the first quarter, we opened 40 new stores net. One of them was the first H&M stores in Taiwan, which opened in Taipei in mid-February. The store has been very well received. And later this year, the first H&M stores in Macau will open. And Peru, South Africa and India are also planned new markets for H&M in 2015. In total, we will open approximately 400 new stores net in 2015, within our target to grow the number of stores by 10% to 15% per year. The largest expansion will take place in existing markets, led again by China and the U.S. One example of an exciting upcoming opening is the planned new H&M flagship store in Herald Square in New York. It will be one of the largest stores in H&M group.\r\nPlease turn to the next slide. Expansion also continues for the newer brands of the group, including COS, & Other Stories, Monki, Weekday and Cheap Monday. Main focus will be on COS and & Other Stories. Both brands will open more new stores in 2015 than in '14. COS will add at least 3 new markets this year: Bahrain, which opened in -- via franchise in February; and Luxembourg; and Czech Republic, which will open in the autumn. With many exciting store openings to look forward to, we are also reaching a growing number of customers via shopping online.\r\nPlease turn to the next slide. H&M's online store, hm.com, will be launched in 9 new markets in 2015. Eight of them will be opened on later this spring. It will be Portugal, Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Belgium. And in the autumn, we're going to also open the H&M online store in Switzerland.\r\nPlease turn to the next slide. As part of our long-term initiatives, we also continued broadening the H&M product range. H&M Sport and H&M's extended shoe range are examples of how we have developed our customer offering in stores and online. Both H&M Sport and extended shoe range have been well received and will be rolled out to more stores.\r\nAnother example is H&M Home. This year, approximately 100 new H&M Home departments will open and around 10 new markets will be added. In 2015, we're also launching yet another new concept, H&M Beauty. H&M Beauty will be a new broad concept for makeup, body care and haircare with high-quality, value-for-money products in a specialty produced design. H&M Beauty will initially be launched in around 900 H&M stores in approximately 40 markets and online in autumn 2015. It will be presented in an inspiring shopping environment, which will further strengthen our customer offering.\r\nAnd now before we move on to the Q&A session, just some words on current developments. Sales in the period of the first -- the 21st of March increased by 9% in local currencies compared to the same period last year. Looking at the external factors affecting our sourcing costs going forward, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar is the most notable factor. The market situation as regards external factors for the purchasing period for the second quarter 2015 is negative because of the substantial strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies, including the euro since autumn 2014. This will be even more negative for the purchasing periods for Q3 and Q4. Although the strong U.S. dollar will result in gradually increased purchasing costs when sourcing for the coming quarters of 2015, we will still make sure to have the best customer offering in each H&M market according to our business concept fashion and quality at the best price in a sustainable way.\r\nAnd with that, we're now happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.",

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.",
      "transcript_text3": "Just a quick question on the incremental investment costs that you highlighted in Q1. Could you give us a sense of how material they were and the phasing across the rest of the year on those incremental costs, please?\n\n---\n\nYes, in Q1, the incremental cost is approx SEK 100 million in Q1. And we still think that for the full year, it will be somewhere between SEK 400 million to SEK 600 million.\n\n---\n\nSo just a couple of things, please. Just on the sales in March so far, I just wondered if there are any special factors affecting the performance. Obviously, it's a short period after a strong 3 months. But were there any special factors, such as calendar effects or timing of promotional activity?\n\n---\n\nNo, not really. But as always, every spring, we say the same message that you should see the sales for March, April and May together due to the differences in when -- timing of spring and Easter, et cetera. So you shouldn't draw too much conclusions from a 3-weeks sales period.\n\n---\n\nRight, okay. And just one more, please. On the balance sheet, I just wonder why intangible fixed assets went up so much in the first quarter. Was there a reason for that?\n\n---\n\nYes, there, are of course, reasons, and the main reason is that we are expanding, but there is also quite a substantial currency effect in the tangible fixed assets. And we are, of course, opening a lot of stores in U.S. and China. So if the balance sheet is having, let's say, somewhere between 10% and 11% just currency effect, so some lines in the balance sheet, for instance, tangible fixed assets, they have much higher currency effects. I think it's close to 20%. So that's the reason we're looking into the balance sheet the increase of the almost 30%.\n\n---\n\nCan I just ask about the product initiatives and what that's doing to overall pricing? I suppose the kind of simplest way of maybe phrasing this is, of the like-for-like that was delivered in the course, and obviously we need to estimate that, was most of that driven by ASP or by volume?\n\n---\n\nIt's, of course, a mix but mostly volume driven.\n\n---\n\nRight. But there was a noticeable ASP impact within that as well. Was that...\n\n---\n\nNo, we don't comment on the ASP development, which could vary over time. But it's mostly mix effects, but again, it's mostly volume.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just going back to your answer about the incremental costs in the quarter and across the full year, last year, I think you said that they were roughly evenly split between OpEx and gross margin. Is that the case this year, or is it more OpEx-oriented?\n\n---\n\nIt will be more or less a 50% split on the cost of goods sold and the rest in -- within the SG&A. So half and half more or less.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So there would have been an impact in the 1Q gross margin, we had to guess, 10 basis points or something like that?\n\n---\n\nYes, something like that.\n\n---\n\nA couple of questions, please. In view of the pressure on sourcing costs because of the U.S. dollar, is there any sort of move towards perhaps adjusting prices as a sort of the medium term in order to try and compensate for the cost pressure?\n\n---\n\nWell, when looking at the gross margin and -- that will develop in the coming quarters, of course, these higher sourcing costs will give an effect on our purchasing prices, but we don't want to exactly going in how we will deal with the stronger U.S. dollar. What we can say is, as Nils already said, that we will speak to our business idea to guarantee that we have the best customer offering on each market. But at the same time, of course, during a period like this, we are following the competitors very close and looking what's happening on different markets. And of course, we will act on that as well, and that can differ from market to market what we will do.\n\n---\n\nI see. And are you seeing any evidence of slight ASP inflation across the competition at present? Or do you think it's too early for that?\n\n---\n\nWell, as Jyrki said, this is something we do continuously. And yes, I mean, if you take some markets like Russia, for example, the ruble has weakened quite dramatically. We've seen price increases, and we have some peers that have announced that they will make yet more price increases. But again, we follow very closely, and there's always a lag from the time of order until the effect will be seen in the stores. And we see that Q2. Especially Q3, Q4, you would be seeing more out in the market probably.\n\n---\n\nJust coming back to your earlier comment, I think you said, I may have missed it, that there was about a 20% impact on fixed assets from currency. Was that right?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think it was just below 20%, 18% or something. And there are quite huge currency effects when translating different currencies to Swedish kronor.\n\n---\n\nRight. And so should we think that in the way you source from that the impact on inventory was of the similar magnitude in the period end?\n\n---\n\nWell, of course, that will sometimes effect, but we are buying inventories in different currencies. And so of course, there might be some pressure in the inventory as well, but I think that's the thing we are able to handle in a good way.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And sorry, just one final one. I think you said that external factors were negative in the quarter, but obviously, markdown benefited your gross margin by about 30 basis points. So I'm wondering what the positive factor was other than markdown within the gross margin this quarter?\n\n---\n\nRight. I mean, again, there are maybe 25, 30 different factors affecting the gross margin. And some are positive and some are negative, and we've highlighted some of the largest ones. But all in all -- I mean, the rest is more or less flattish, I would say, if you -- but we have -- I mean, the markdown such as that was around 30 basis points year-on-year. And then you have the long-term investments, which was negative 10 bps or something. And the rest is a combination of the other factors.\n\n---\n\nOkay. But external factors were negative. So we should assume your commercial policies were the thing that delivered the positive balance, yes.\n\n---\n\nAgain, there's so many other factors and depending on -- I mean, what we try to comment is the market conditions, and then we might succeed better than the market in negotiating or whatever. It doesn't necessarily mean that the gross margin will be exactly as the external factors.\n\n---\n\nI had a question about the operating costs. So they grew 14% on a constant-currency basis, and I appreciate there's about SEK 100 million in there for year-over-year increase in long-term costs.\n\n---\n\nNo, actually SEK 50 million, half and half in the SG&A.\n\n---\n\nYes, sorry, any SEK 50 million, yes, obviously in the OpEx line. Doesn't really see us a lot of OpEx leverage. Could you talk about cost in comparable stores, which you've done in the past, versus the incremental cost of growth?\n\n---\n\nYes, we still have a good cost control, but in comparable stores, it's more or less in Q1 slightly higher than last year. And -- but as a share of sales, it's a lower share of sales in Q1. But of course, as we said many times that we have the underlying inflation when it comes to salaries, et cetera, so the normal is that there is an underlying increase in the cost for comparable stores as well. Now we have been successful some quarters to come in even below in money, but I would say that the normal situation is that we have to work hard as we do with the efficiency and then hopefully also have a positive like-for-like.\n\n---\n\nAnd on the CapEx side of things, you've just reiterated your CapEx guidance for the year, and I appreciate it is a range. But given the movement of the depreciation of the krona, is there upside risk to that CapEx guidance?\n\n---\n\nYes, when we guide the SEK 11 billion to SEK 11.5 billion, that's with the currencies prevailing at the year end. So of course, when we are translating the CapEx from different countries to Swedish kronor it will increase. But we speak to the guidance with the prevailing currency rate that was in connection with the year end and then able to guidance this SEK 11 billion to SEK 11.5 billion. But as we said, it's a moving target. It can be revised decisions. Some parts will come up the new opportunities, et cetera, so -- but that's the best guidance we have for today.\n\n---\n\nOne question in terms of the FX impact on the gross margin in the first quarter. Would you be able to quantify that or tell us whether that was positive or negative?\n\n---\n\nWe said that the external factors aggregated are slightly negative, but just the FX is more or less neutral.\n\n---\n\nSorry, I didn't catch that. Just the FX was...\n\n---\n\nMore or less neutral.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Then another one very quick. In terms of -- if we see the entire March, and I know that's a really detailed one, but March has one less weekend this year, if I'm not wrong, versus the previous year. Don't you think that this will have a calendar impact because I heard you saying that you want to see on a 3-quarter -- on a 3-month basis sales, but you haven't mentioned any calendar impact and you haven't quantified, which you usually do. So I wonder whether do you think that there is a calendar impact for March.\n\n---\n\nYes, for the full March, as you say, there is a negative calendar effect estimated to 2% or to 3%. So that's a negative calendar effect.\n\n---\n\nI see, but there isn't one from the 1st until the 21st, right.\n\n---\n\nNo, there is no calendar effect. There is 3 Saturdays, 3 comparable days for each weekday. So there is no calendar effect in that figure.\n\n---\n\nWe can hear you very poorly, by the way. Gentlemen, I'd like to ask you a question on the online rollout. Obviously, we noticed quite a substantial increase in local currency sales in markets like the U.S. but also in Italy and a few other prominent markets where you've just recently rolled out new channel sales. Could you educate us a bit on the impact on those markets from new channel sales, please.\n\n---\n\nYes. We are very happy, again, with the online development but also with the store development. It's a combination of both online and offline.\n\n---\n\nYes. And I also understand you've been rolling out various software systems and changed the -- made a few changes to the product offering versus customers enabling in some markets a more seamless customer experience with returns possible in physical stores, et cetera. How has that rolled out? And is there any early indications of the impact on bottom line, please.\n\n---\n\nAgain, this is the reason why we invest so much in online and IT. It's not just expansion of the online store to more markets. It's also, as we'd elaborated many times now, the improvement of the existing stores and to take it to even further level, so to speak, and in terms of greater offering, wider offering, better navigation and seamless features as we discussed before. So developing very well, but we take it step-by-step and very promising.\n\n---\n\nAnd final question, if I may. Can I just say, I guess, there are 3 main sort of possibilities to counteract the increasing sourcing costs ahead: changes to price points; changes to mix and categories; and buying cheaper goods. Do you think -- is there anything of this that you've been discussing in particular or -- and/or are there any other options available for you at your discretion, please.\n\n---\n\nAs we discussed before, the number of things we work on, of course, we work very hard, but we don't compromise with the quality, of course. But having said that, it's of course very difficult to offset the magnitude of the sharp U.S. dollar increase.\n\n---\n\nAnd finally, in terms of price position in the market, you said you're monitoring closely your competitors. Are you referring to your absolute position or your relative position in the marketplace?\n\n---\n\nIt's both, of course, and this is done on a continuous basis, not just right now when the dollar is changing rapidly.\n\n---\n\nI just wanted to, Nils, to elaborate on this -- looking at the 3 months together, the March, April, May numbers, you said it's a recurring thing every year. Is it because of the change of season or because the weather is so dodgy worldwide? What's the reason why we need to take those 3 months all together?\n\n---\n\nIt's very simple. As I said, the timing of when the spring arrives in each market varies a lot and also the timing of the different Easter and holidays makes a big, huge impact on the monthly sales numbers. Just look at our historical monthly sales numbers. You will see very volatile numbers.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And that's every year, that's recurring every year?\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nJust a question on what's happening in Asia and Europe and the apparent margin erosion there. If you could address what that -- what might be -- that might be based in the specific causes for the operating margin erosion?\n\n---\n\nAre you referring to the segment report? Again, this is as a result of our transfer pricing policy timings. You can't draw too many conclusions on a quarterly basis, I'm sorry.\n\n---\n\nApologies in advance. I think, I might have just missed a comment early. Just wanted to clarify. Did you or ostensibly could you if not quantify the impact on your inventory balance from the U.S. dollar appreciation, which -- implied earlier was a significant reason for the increase that we're seeing now?\n\n---\n\nOf course, there's a significant dollar impact, but we choose not to quantify it, no.\n\n---\n\nJust a question, going back to the big move in FX, so we're seeing as a sort of 20% or so move in the dollar versus the euro. How does that compare with the situation a few years ago when the cotton price had trebled? Is it the same sort of magnitude in terms of what it does to your effective -- to your bought-in prices?\n\n---\n\nIt's difficult to say because, of course, there are similarities, but there are also big differences. And I think the company is different and the world looks different.\n\n---\n\nYes. So your response on, say, external factors may be different. But in terms of the quantum, is it possible to sort of compare the 2 together?\n\n---\n\nNo, not really, I think. I see where you're heading, but I think it's important to look at history and learn from that. But again, there are always some other tweaks and again different environment today than it was 4 or 5 years ago.\n\n---\n\nYes. I mean, by different environment, do you mean that obviously we're in the middle of a financial crisis at that point and we're not now. Or is there anything else that's changed?\n\n---\n\nA lot of -- most things have changed, I would say. We have a different exposure to different markets. We are larger, et cetera. But what I could say is the same is, of course, our long-term commitment and always to have the best offering in each market.\n\n---\n\nDo you think with the change in your geographical exposure, your markets are more competitive now than they were 4 or 5 years ago?\n\n---\n\nIn a way, you could say by definition. The competition is always getting worse because everyone tries to improve things. But at the same time, in some markets, there might be softer competition because a lot of competitors have left the market, et cetera. But of course, for us, it's always about improving things and strengthening our offering and being long term.\n\n---\n\nI've just got one follow-up question, please, on the sourcing model. I know that you've got significant volumes out and sourced up the Far East. If the dollar sort of stays where it is over the medium term, is there any sort of prospect of you bringing some of your sourcing back close to home back into the European basin or anything?\n\n---\n\nI mean, there is always a lot of development going on in sourcing, meaning also shifting from different markets. But again, with the balance we have, you can't just jump back and forth. But this is something we continuously look at. And we -- since we grow so much, we also continuously have to add new markets and new suppliers. So that's why we're looking at sourcing in Africa, for example, in Burma, et cetera. But of course, we still source almost 20% of the volumes in Europe, which of course is very interesting for proximity and speed.\n\n---\n\nAnd are you seeing any sort of pressure on European sourcing costs or opportunity costs because of perhaps a geographical shift away from the dollar-denominated sourcing?\n\n---\n\nSorry, say again the question, please.\n\n---\n\nIs there any sort of shift away -- is there any pressure on European-based opportunic costs because of the competitors might be shifting away from the -- from Asia, for example?\n\n---\n\nYes, it might be for a lot of the players are moving and sourcing to Europe, of course, then it's of course maybe causing capacity limitations, et cetera, which could affect the price. But we haven't seen that at the moment, but of course, it might be in the future, the situation if more and more sourcing are moved to Europe.\n\n---\n\nCan you just remind us of the actual mechanism by which you hedge out your U.S. dollar exposure on sourcing?\n\n---\n\nRight. It's very simple, and we do it continuously, meaning that each order or every day when we place new orders, we hedge the exposures until we pay the suppliers, to say in a simple way, meaning that the -- as I said before, the lag between time of the -- when you place the order until you see the effect coming through in the figures, and the P&L, et cetera, is roughly 2 quarters. And this is done continuously no matter if the dollar is weak or strong.\n\n---\n\nI think of one more -- one last question. You've opened fewer stores in Q1 this year versus Q1 last year. Was that by design or just more a question of availability of new space?\n\n---\n\nIt's more a timing issue. But again, our target for the year of approximately 400 new stores remain.\n\n---\n\nJust to follow up, given the interest rates in Sweden are in negative territory, Central Bank. I mean, does that make you think any differently about your balance sheet and your cash balances going forward? I'm aware, obviously, of cash across your different geographies. But generally, anything we should be thinking about in terms of the cash on the balance sheet and the payout ratios or dividend? Or I think will it broadly remain as it was before?\n\n---\n\nYes, when it comes to the cash situation and the interest rates, we often have got the question, do you have too much money laying in the bank accounts? Of course, it's a relevant question, but we are happy with our cash position and the balance we have at the current time. So what's happening in the future, that we will see. But for now, we think we are in a good balance.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And maybe just one follow-up question on sourcing. Is there any discussions around Chinese suppliers that you could potentially buy in euros going forward, as we've seen in a few other sort of industries? Or is this generally always been U.S. dollar price sourcing and that's the way it'll stay?\n\n---\n\nWell, of course, we're always open to new ideas. This is something that we've been looking at. But now -- I mean, I think the U.S. dollar is the predominant sourcing currency in Asia.\n\n---\n\nNow we've gone a quarter into the year 2015. I was just wondering, would you actually care to give us a little bit more detailed breakdown of the investment-related extra costs that you actually expect for the full year on a quarterly basis?\n\n---\n\nYou mean these incremental long-term investments?\n\n---\n\nYes, please.\n\n---\n\nI think the message is the same. For the year, we approximately guide SEK 400 million to SEK 600 million, but they could be spread unevenly between the quarter. So sorry, we can't give you any more flavor.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just a nitty-gritty question. You state the number of stores in China at 278 at the end of your fiscal Q1. And according to the most recent set of results for Q4, you had 291 stores in China. So that implies actually 13 stores, 13 fewer stores, which is not in tandem with the report and the tables on Page 12 today. I was just wondering if I'm missing something here.\n\n---\n\nThat's because we have broken out Hong Kong.\n\n---\n\nThank you, all, very much for participating in this conference call and welcome back for the second quarter results on the 25th of June. Goodbye.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Paul Steegers (Analysts)】\nJust a quick question on the incremental investment costs that you highlighted in Q1. Could you give us a sense of how material they were and the phasing across the rest of the year on those incremental costs, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, in Q1, the incremental cost is approx SEK 100 million in Q1. And we still think that for the full year, it will be somewhere between SEK 400 million to SEK 600 million.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Chamberlain (Analysts)】\nSo just a couple of things, please. Just on the sales in March so far, I just wondered if there are any special factors affecting the performance. Obviously, it's a short period after a strong 3 months. But were there any special factors, such as calendar effects or timing of promotional activity?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nNo, not really. But as always, every spring, we say the same message that you should see the sales for March, April and May together due to the differences in when -- timing of spring and Easter, et cetera. So you shouldn't draw too much conclusions from a 3-weeks sales period.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Chamberlain (Analysts)】\nRight, okay. And just one more, please. On the balance sheet, I just wonder why intangible fixed assets went up so much in the first quarter. Was there a reason for that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, there, are of course, reasons, and the main reason is that we are expanding, but there is also quite a substantial currency effect in the tangible fixed assets. And we are, of course, opening a lot of stores in U.S. and China. So if the balance sheet is having, let's say, somewhere between 10% and 11% just currency effect, so some lines in the balance sheet, for instance, tangible fixed assets, they have much higher currency effects. I think it's close to 20%. So that's the reason we're looking into the balance sheet the increase of the almost 30%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Irwin (Analysts)】\nCan I just ask about the product initiatives and what that's doing to overall pricing? I suppose the kind of simplest way of maybe phrasing this is, of the like-for-like that was delivered in the course, and obviously we need to estimate that, was most of that driven by ASP or by volume?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nIt's, of course, a mix but mostly volume driven.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Irwin (Analysts)】\nRight. But there was a noticeable ASP impact within that as well. Was that...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nNo, we don't comment on the ASP development, which could vary over time. But it's mostly mix effects, but again, it's mostly volume.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Irwin (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just going back to your answer about the incremental costs in the quarter and across the full year, last year, I think you said that they were roughly evenly split between OpEx and gross margin. Is that the case this year, or is it more OpEx-oriented?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nIt will be more or less a 50% split on the cost of goods sold and the rest in -- within the SG&A. So half and half more or less.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Simon Irwin (Analysts)】\nOkay. So there would have been an impact in the 1Q gross margin, we had to guess, 10 basis points or something like that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, something like that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nA couple of questions, please. In view of the pressure on sourcing costs because of the U.S. dollar, is there any sort of move towards perhaps adjusting prices as a sort of the medium term in order to try and compensate for the cost pressure?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nWell, when looking at the gross margin and -- that will develop in the coming quarters, of course, these higher sourcing costs will give an effect on our purchasing prices, but we don't want to exactly going in how we will deal with the stronger U.S. dollar. What we can say is, as Nils already said, that we will speak to our business idea to guarantee that we have the best customer offering on each market. But at the same time, of course, during a period like this, we are following the competitors very close and looking what's happening on different markets. And of course, we will act on that as well, and that can differ from market to market what we will do.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nI see. And are you seeing any evidence of slight ASP inflation across the competition at present? Or do you think it's too early for that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWell, as Jyrki said, this is something we do continuously. And yes, I mean, if you take some markets like Russia, for example, the ruble has weakened quite dramatically. We've seen price increases, and we have some peers that have announced that they will make yet more price increases. But again, we follow very closely, and there's always a lag from the time of order until the effect will be seen in the stores. And we see that Q2. Especially Q3, Q4, you would be seeing more out in the market probably.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nJust coming back to your earlier comment, I think you said, I may have missed it, that there was about a 20% impact on fixed assets from currency. Was that right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, I think it was just below 20%, 18% or something. And there are quite huge currency effects when translating different currencies to Swedish kronor.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nRight. And so should we think that in the way you source from that the impact on inventory was of the similar magnitude in the period end?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nWell, of course, that will sometimes effect, but we are buying inventories in different currencies. And so of course, there might be some pressure in the inventory as well, but I think that's the thing we are able to handle in a good way.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nOkay. And sorry, just one final one. I think you said that external factors were negative in the quarter, but obviously, markdown benefited your gross margin by about 30 basis points. So I'm wondering what the positive factor was other than markdown within the gross margin this quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nRight. I mean, again, there are maybe 25, 30 different factors affecting the gross margin. And some are positive and some are negative, and we've highlighted some of the largest ones. But all in all -- I mean, the rest is more or less flattish, I would say, if you -- but we have -- I mean, the markdown such as that was around 30 basis points year-on-year. And then you have the long-term investments, which was negative 10 bps or something. And the rest is a combination of the other factors.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nOkay. But external factors were negative. So we should assume your commercial policies were the thing that delivered the positive balance, yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nAgain, there's so many other factors and depending on -- I mean, what we try to comment is the market conditions, and then we might succeed better than the market in negotiating or whatever. It doesn't necessarily mean that the gross margin will be exactly as the external factors.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nI had a question about the operating costs. So they grew 14% on a constant-currency basis, and I appreciate there's about SEK 100 million in there for year-over-year increase in long-term costs.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nNo, actually SEK 50 million, half and half in the SG&A.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nYes, sorry, any SEK 50 million, yes, obviously in the OpEx line. Doesn't really see us a lot of OpEx leverage. Could you talk about cost in comparable stores, which you've done in the past, versus the incremental cost of growth?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, we still have a good cost control, but in comparable stores, it's more or less in Q1 slightly higher than last year. And -- but as a share of sales, it's a lower share of sales in Q1. But of course, as we said many times that we have the underlying inflation when it comes to salaries, et cetera, so the normal is that there is an underlying increase in the cost for comparable stores as well. Now we have been successful some quarters to come in even below in money, but I would say that the normal situation is that we have to work hard as we do with the efficiency and then hopefully also have a positive like-for-like.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Muir-Sands (Analysts)】\nAnd on the CapEx side of things, you've just reiterated your CapEx guidance for the year, and I appreciate it is a range. But given the movement of the depreciation of the krona, is there upside risk to that CapEx guidance?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, when we guide the SEK 11 billion to SEK 11.5 billion, that's with the currencies prevailing at the year end. So of course, when we are translating the CapEx from different countries to Swedish kronor it will increase. But we speak to the guidance with the prevailing currency rate that was in connection with the year end and then able to guidance this SEK 11 billion to SEK 11.5 billion. But as we said, it's a moving target. It can be revised decisions. Some parts will come up the new opportunities, et cetera, so -- but that's the best guidance we have for today.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nOne question in terms of the FX impact on the gross margin in the first quarter. Would you be able to quantify that or tell us whether that was positive or negative?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nWe said that the external factors aggregated are slightly negative, but just the FX is more or less neutral.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nSorry, I didn't catch that. Just the FX was...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nMore or less neutral.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nOkay. Then another one very quick. In terms of -- if we see the entire March, and I know that's a really detailed one, but March has one less weekend this year, if I'm not wrong, versus the previous year. Don't you think that this will have a calendar impact because I heard you saying that you want to see on a 3-quarter -- on a 3-month basis sales, but you haven't mentioned any calendar impact and you haven't quantified, which you usually do. So I wonder whether do you think that there is a calendar impact for March.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, for the full March, as you say, there is a negative calendar effect estimated to 2% or to 3%. So that's a negative calendar effect.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Chaviaras (Analysts)】\nI see, but there isn't one from the 1st until the 21st, right.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nNo, there is no calendar effect. There is 3 Saturdays, 3 comparable days for each weekday. So there is no calendar effect in that figure.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nicklas Fhärm (Analysts)】\nWe can hear you very poorly, by the way. Gentlemen, I'd like to ask you a question on the online rollout.

It's not just expansion of the online store to more markets.

So developing very well, but we take it step-by-step and very promising.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nicklas Fhärm (Analysts)】\nAnd final question, if I may.

But of course, we still source almost 20% of the volumes in Europe, which of course is very interesting for proximity and speed.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nAnd are you seeing any sort of pressure on European sourcing costs or opportunity costs because of perhaps a geographical shift away from the dollar-denominated sourcing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nSorry, say again the question, please.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nIs there any sort of shift away -- is there any pressure on European-based opportunic costs because of the competitors might be shifting away from the -- from Asia, for example?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, it might be for a lot of the players are moving and sourcing to Europe, of course, then it's of course maybe causing capacity limitations, et cetera, which could affect the price. But we haven't seen that at the moment, but of course, it might be in the future, the situation if more and more sourcing are moved to Europe.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Rossington (Analysts)】\nCan you just remind us of the actual mechanism by which you hedge out your U.S. dollar exposure on sourcing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nRight. It's very simple, and we do it continuously, meaning that each order or every day when we place new orders, we hedge the exposures until we pay the suppliers, to say in a simple way, meaning that the -- as I said before, the lag between time of the -- when you place the order until you see the effect coming through in the figures, and the P&L, et cetera, is roughly 2 quarters. And this is done continuously no matter if the dollar is weak or strong.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Rossington (Analysts)】\nI think of one more -- one last question. You've opened fewer stores in Q1 this year versus Q1 last year. Was that by design or just more a question of availability of new space?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nIt's more a timing issue. But again, our target for the year of approximately 400 new stores remain.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Steegers (Analysts)】\nJust to follow up, given the interest rates in Sweden are in negative territory, Central Bank. I mean, does that make you think any differently about your balance sheet and your cash balances going forward? I'm aware, obviously, of cash across your different geographies. But generally, anything we should be thinking about in terms of the cash on the balance sheet and the payout ratios or dividend? Or I think will it broadly remain as it was before?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jyrki Tervonen (Executives)】\nYes, when it comes to the cash situation and the interest rates, we often have got the question, do you have too much money laying in the bank accounts? Of course, it's a relevant question, but we are happy with our cash position and the balance we have at the current time. So what's happening in the future, that we will see. But for now, we think we are in a good balance.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Steegers (Analysts)】\nOkay. And maybe just one follow-up question on sourcing. Is there any discussions around Chinese suppliers that you could potentially buy in euros going forward, as we've seen in a few other sort of industries? Or is this generally always been U.S. dollar price sourcing and that's the way it'll stay?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nWell, of course, we're always open to new ideas. This is something that we've been looking at. But now -- I mean, I think the U.S. dollar is the predominant sourcing currency in Asia.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nicklas Fhärm (Analysts)】\nNow we've gone a quarter into the year 2015. I was just wondering, would you actually care to give us a little bit more detailed breakdown of the investment-related extra costs that you actually expect for the full year on a quarterly basis?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nYou mean these incremental long-term investments?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nicklas Fhärm (Analysts)】\nYes, please.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nI think the message is the same. For the year, we approximately guide SEK 400 million to SEK 600 million, but they could be spread unevenly between the quarter. So sorry, we can't give you any more flavor.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nicklas Fhärm (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just a nitty-gritty question. You state the number of stores in China at 278 at the end of your fiscal Q1. And according to the most recent set of results for Q4, you had 291 stores in China. So that implies actually 13 stores, 13 fewer stores, which is not in tandem with the report and the tables on Page 12 today. I was just wondering if I'm missing something here.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nThat's because we have broken out Hong Kong.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Nils Vinge (Executives)】\nThank you, all, very much for participating in this conference call and welcome back for the second quarter results on the 25th of June. Goodbye.",

In the management team, we have our Chairman, Mr. Hao Jian Min; and the CEO of the Group; Vice Chairman, Mr. Xiao Xiao of the Group; CEO, Mr. Chen Yi; Vice Chairman and our Chief Construction Expert, Mr. Luo Liang; and our CFO, Mr. Nip Yun. And first of all, please welcome Mr. Hao to go over the 2014 business review for all of us.\n\n---\n\nDear, friends, and those audience who are watching this on video, good afternoon. I am very happy that we have this opportunity. After the annual result announcement, we have this opportunity to communicate with our investors. First of all, I would like to thank you, all, for your support to China Overseas, and my report today is mainly -- has mainly the 5 sections and you have that PPT on hand. And I'm going to go over it briefly so that we have more time for Q&A session. First part is our annual results. In 2014, the key profit index continued to grow rapidly on a high basis and our performance has again historic record. And over the year, we have realized a total revenue of HKD 120 billion, a year-on-year rise of 45.5% compared to last year. Net profit attributable to shareholders is HKD 27.68 billion and 20.1% rise. And our core profit has increased by 25.6%, reaching HKD 23.83 billion; basic EPS, HKD 3.39, a rise of 20.1%. And the board recommended a year-end dividend of HKD 0.35, an annual dividend of HKD 0.55, an increase year-on-year of 17%. So the dividend accounts for 18.9% of core profit. I am reading this slowly on purpose so that our audience online could hear it carefully. In 2014, we have maintained the ability of great value creation, and gross profit has increased by 0.2% to 32.7%; net profit, 23.1%; core net profit, 19.9%. If excluding the buyback of social housing and funding -- and funds, the adjusted gross margin is 34.3%. Compared to mid-2014, using the same way, same calculation methods, the method is roughly the same. In the chart below it, it shows the dividend. Here, you can see it shows the revenue and profit of the group, and during this period, the property development revenue is HKD 116.25 billion, which accounts for 96.7% of the total revenue, an increase of 47.9%. And rental income has increased by 38.2% to HKD 1.18 billion. Property investment has realized a profit of HKD 6.03 billion, an increase year-on-year, 43.5%.\r\nOn this page, you can see our shareholders equity has risen by 21.2% to HKD 133.33 billion. Net asset book value per share, HKD 16.3, and year-on-year increase of 20.7%. Annual average shareholder return is 22.8%, and we continue to maximize the profit for -- and value creation for the shareholders. By the end of last year, cash on hand is HKD 51.28 billion; long-term liability, HKD 71.99 billion; net gearing ratio, 32.4%. We have continuously realized our target of gearing ratio no higher than 40%, and maintained the healthy level of the financials of the company. \r\nAnd during the year, the group has again received good results from S&P, Moody's and Fitch. And during this volatility of Chinese property market, the healthy financials have really helped us to maintain the high recognition from those professional rating agencies. \r\nIn May and in June, we have issued many -- lots of guaranteed notes and totaling USD 2 billion. We have also complete -- acquired the largest club loan in November, totaling HKD 14 billion. And thanks to the confidence and support of the capital market, we were able to maintain the interest rate at a relatively low level. In terms of our financial resources: cash on hand, RMB 85%; Hong Kong dollars, 2.6%; and U.S. dollars, 12.4%, including unused credit facilities, totaling HKD 11.7 billion. We have financial resources available, HKD 62.98 billion. We have enough reserves for our future development. In terms of bonds, we have corporate bond, HKD 48.18 billion, and bank loans, HKD 46.36 billion. Long-term liabilities with more than 1 year, 76.2 years, and debt structure and repayment cycle are all very healthy. \r\nAnd now let's go over the business for last year. In 2014, we have realized contracted property sales, HKD 140.8 billion. GFA sold, 9.398 million square meters. By end of December, we still have subscribed property sales, HKD 7.77 billion, and waiting to sign the contracts. I should think that they have been signed by today. You look at it by region, South China has -- Southern China has realized HKD 32.96 billion, which has contributed the greatest portion to the profit of the company. For Hong Kong and Macau, contracted sales, HKD 5.06 billion, and our sales collection rate is 88%, totaling HKD 102.09 billion, and maintaining the leader in the market. \r\nAnd now let's look at the completed areas, completed GFA. And in terms of completion, we have -- for the group and our JV projects, we have 51 projects. These are our own projects, and 4 JV products (sic) [projects] and the completed GFA is 10.77 million square meters. By end of December, we have already sold 79.4% of our own project and 90% of the JV projects. \r\nAnd this chart shows you pre-sales and bookings. In terms of bookings, including JV projects, we have 7.78 million property bookings, totaling HKD 131.4 billion. By end of December, including JV projects, we still have 4.12 million square meters project for pre-sale waiting to be completed, and totaling HKD 65.3 billion. \r\nOn this chart, you can see the land acquisition for 2014. The whole year, we have entered Jiangdong, Taiyuan. I don't need to explain this, right? You know where they are located, which province. And in Jinan, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Wuxi, Kunming, Xi'an, we have also acquired another 17 plots of land, and total area for development, 9.04 million square meters and totaling RMB 38.28 billion, and the average land cost is around RMB 4,234 per square meters; it's roughly in line with the average land cost for the past 2 years, which has ensured the profitability going forward.\r\nOn this chart is our land acquisition by end of 2014. Currently, if you add the 14 cities from China Overseas, Hongyang, and we have business in China across 47 cities, including Hong Kong and Macau. In beginning of 2015, we have purchased 2 plots of land. Area for development, 1.625 million, and the land price is RMB 3.56 billion. On this chart, it shows our property investment. Property investment completed, 1.14 million square meters, and the rentals of mature properties are doing well. Office buildings in the Hong Kong, Beijing and Chengdu, and the Unipark shopping malls in Jinan, rental rate have exceeded 90%, and the rental income have increased to HKD 1.18 billion and year-on-year increase of 38.2%. Last year, we have opened the Unipark shopping malls in Shenyang, and rental rate has also climbed up to 90%. And Unipark shopping malls in Nanjing will open its door this year, and other shopping malls in the developed second-tier cities will gradually start business. With our chain operation, we believe that's the brand and influence of China Overseas will continue to improve. So I believe that, for the first part, it is very similar to your expectation. You would have expected this. \r\nAnd this part is something that you always ask me, but I have never really quite responded to your questions recently with regard to asset injection. Today, when we are issuing our result announcement, we have also published the announcement between us and our parent company on asset injection and share subscription, including some acquisition of several real estate projects. And now I'm going to talk to you through this, and there are many -- a few parts. One is the strategic meanings of this transaction for China Overseas. Here, we have listed a few points, some of which might be something that you've already thought about. If there are any things that you feel like we've left out, please tell me. I would like to talk to you about the few points here.\r\nHere, this time after the consolidation, in terms of our resources, we are better distributed between the first, second and third tier cities in China, especially in the first tier cities. And we know that in the past few years, especially in the first tier cities, regardless of how the sales go, the land price is always very high. So for the first tier cities and second tier cities, to continue to acquire land, that will play a very important role in maintaining our leading position in the market. \r\nSecond, in terms of coverage of the regions. With the asset injection, we have 9 cities which are already included so -- which are not included. And it really helps with our countrywide plan and to cover the major economic bouts in the fast developing regions. Well, of course, because, thanks to our brand consolidation, going forward, we could maximize the advantage of our brand, and you could think and imagine how that's going to help us using the same brand. Fourthly, in terms of core competence, because in the past, we've always had very good quality when it comes to cost control and product quality et cetera. Going forward, in those projects, all of these qualities will be exempted again, so it is worth expecting, it is worth waiting for. And finally, this is something that I'm eager to share with you. In the past, I feel that when I was talking to you, perhaps, people didn't really quite understand it, but today, I want to share with you what support really means.\r\nIn terms of the group support, you can see in the announcement, our parent company will no longer participate in direct sales of property business. And this has avoided the possibility of cannibalization. And again, you can see from these arrangements, COLI as one of the important business arms of our parent company. You can really see how important we are to the parent. So based on these reasons mentioned above, I believe that this is a great strategy. Just now, I said if you feel like there's anything that I missed out, please feel free and do tell me about it.\r\nAnd now let's look at the structure of the deal and consideration, and the deal is -- includes 2 parts, asset injection and shares subscription. And asset injection, the total consideration is RMB 1.82 billion, and in terms of the CSCL loans, it amounts to RMB 31.99 billion, and COHL, the parent company, will subscribe to 1.687 billion new shares and at the price of RMB 28.38 price per share. Compared to the market closing price of yesterday, there is -- and this is 10.8% higher than the market closing price of yesterday, and compared to the average market closing price, 10 trading days prior to the announcement of this deal, this is 15.2% higher. This time, the asset injection includes 30 projects, and the total consideration in the CSCL loan is RMB 33.82 billion, and because I worry about some of the differences when it comes to exchange rate, so everything is calculate -- denominated in RMB. And the total GFA is 10.92 million square meters located in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Suzhou, Chengdu, Xi'an, Urumqi, Changsha, Weifang, Zibo and London. Compared to our cities disclosed in the past, the 24 cities, some of them are different, and the total consideration in the CSCL loan is RMB 33.82 billion, and there's one figure I could tell you here. I didn't tell this to the media. For all these asset, our original investment is RMB 31.11 billion. You should understand what I mean here, right? \r\nMoving on to the transactions timeline. Today, we have made the announcement. We predict no later than 17th April, we will dispatch the circular. Well, these are all expected time schedule, so this is just for your reference. And roughly in line with this, I hold myself responsible for everything I say, but I must tell you that this is an estimated timeline. May 5, we will have a General Meeting, and we expect by end of May, this acquisition would be completed.\r\nNext page. These are reasons for completing the deal and benefits that brings us. Perhaps, I should not talk about benefits myself. Perhaps, it is up to you to talk about it, and a few points I would like to share with you here. First, our parent company have completed their consolidation of direct sale -- of their direct sales property industry, and they have confirmed that COLI has the most important real estate business platform, and has eliminated the potential competition between China Overseas, COLI and the parent company. On the other hand, the parent company, as a SOE with great reputation when it comes to property and construction, they have always been giving us great support. After the deal, the parent will continue to give support to us in terms of human resources, financials, financing, business resources and business network, et cetera. When I'm saying this, you should have seen that our parent company have said that they will exit the direct sales of real estate business, and today's A-shares market is completely different from 2 years -- from a few years ago. For a company with a potential of -- a value of RMB 200 billion, where is it going to go? It is worth waiting to see. Second, the deal will complement the land acquisition for COLI. After the deal, our land acquisition have increased by 29.1%, reaching 48.3 million square meters. The land acquisition here does not include our own land development for 2015. \r\nAnd thirdly, the asset injection will bring new impetus for growth for COLI, and in the asset package, there are different -- there are sales property -- property for sales in different phases waiting to be built during construction and small -- and a small portion of investment property. Upon completion of the deal, we believe that this will contribute positively to our contract sales, cash flow, profit growth and income, and these words are said by the lawyers. I am not allowed to say this. I would be able to put it in a more lively fashion, but I'm not allowed to say that, so please just go by the lawyers words. \r\nAnd finally, I would like to tell you that the asset being injected is net cash. And after the deal's completion, the equity foundation will be more solid, and our capital structure will be further improved. Our financials are so healthy that they cannot be further improved. I cannot release specific figures to you. I estimate that even including the Hong Kong, Macau companies, you will not be able to find the companies with better financials than us. On this chart, you can see that the distribution of the asset across China and London, and total GFA is 10.92 million square meters.\r\nMoving on, I don't know if you are interested in this market analysis. If you're not, I can jump this. Should we vote, those who think we should jump the market analysis? Not half of the audience here. So maybe I'll just read it out. So apologies to those who have put up their hand. Just a very simple analysis, a very simple report. I believe, as you have all studied this closely yourselves, and I'm just going to share with you some of the informations that we have. And here, we have outlook on the Chinese macroeconomic situation, and there's one point that I believe that I should share with you. Despite for 2015, the GDP growth target is only 7%, same as when Premier Li were answering the questions. For our country, our GDP growth, even if we have slowed down to 7%, this is already the total aggregate of many other countries. So under this fast speed and the high basis, high benchmark of the current Chinese economy, and we're still able to maintain a relatively high growth, and we are very confident about the future of China's economy, and especially for the new employment being created, which is over 10 million positions, and so that would make sure that -- I'm sure that, that will bring more stable structural demand for the property industry. \r\nAnd here is our market liquidity, and I'm not going to go into details, and here, we have some property outlook. I'm not going to read out it word by word, but I believe that it is still worth reading when you have time. And when it comes to the policy level, what I'm about to say, it is not included on the PPT. I just want to share with you. We believe that the market will become more market-driven in the next few years. And in the past, we normally say that the government will control the government and the market will control the market, and you know that in the past and the Chinese economy and the property market have always been affected by policies, et cetera. Going forward, as one of the most important growth sector, which is the -- which belongs to the consumption as an important index for growth for the Chinese economy, I believe that there is still hope in this market. Second, on the market's demand, it is changing structurally. The property market has also entered into a new normal. In the past, we talk about different demands. For example, structural demand, investment demand, et cetera, and upgrading demand, but actually, the concepts, they are very blurred. \r\nWhat is the project that has really met the structural demand of the consumers? Not many people have studied this. And once that comes out, this will change the market dramatically. And I would like also to say that, going forward, we will be doing very well in terms of getting rid of the inventory. I remember that, in February, across the nation, we still have 600-million-something square meters to be sold, waiting to be sold. And this figure is the figure that we have achieved in 2014, which is a relatively low year for property transactions. So I believe that in the next 1 year to 15 months during this period, these areas will be digested by the market. But I need to tell you in which areas we will be able to get rid of more inventories, and which areas it won't be so successful. So I would like to say that there will be a more clear division between the urban areas and the rural areas in China. This is really affected by many different factors, not only just about the growth of the economy and the population. If you do not study these relevant indexes carefully, there is still a lot of risk when it comes to investing in the Chinese property market. \r\nI know that a lot of people are talking to you, and 5 years ago, and people, I would say that I would only do the first to second tier cities, but some of you might have not understood this 5 years ago. For the Chinese cities development, actually, there is a cycle. If you cannot study the cycle clearly, how can you make sure that you have good operation and good returns on your projects? So the division between the land and the division between cities, going forward, will also be a main theme of the market. And lastly, the concentration will become more and more tense a few years. I told you we had 50 thousand [ph] companies in the market, and I've already said we can't have so many companies in the market in terms of time, in terms of region. These are all factors will contribute to the consolidation of the companies, and today, I think the consolidation is about to happen. For the property market, a market, there was no competition. This is not a mature market. This is not a healthy market nor is it a healthy competition. Why am I telling you this? A company's core competence will be changed during this process. After the past 5 years of consolidation, both internally and externally, for COLI, this time's asset injection, actually, we have also completed the internal asset consolidation. If you look at the asset distribution, this is not a small company. We are bigger than medium-sized companies. There aren't so many companies with so much reserves. \r\nSo one of the core competence that COLI possesses is our ability to consolidate, both internally and externally. Our parent companies business, the team of over hundreds of people, they have already joined us and they are doing very well. Today, I can tell you this. So these are things that is not included in the PPT. You can read the PPT after the meeting when you have more time. \r\nAnd the last part is on the value chain management. Well, actually, I've told you about this in the past about the value chain method and the model, but what I would like to tell you is our new management and our new operation model. You can put this in your internal report, but do not release it to the outside. I have heard that some companies are copying this. I would like to share this with you because I think it is meaningful for your report, but I really hope that you will not tell this to others, especially my peers. I'm not afraid of them. Some of the stuff, they just can't learn. They're not able to learn, but because I tell so much to you guys, so please, please do not tell this to others, and let's consider that as part of the goodwill.\r\nWell, finally, on guidance for 2015. For our target this year, there's one thing that's missing, one figure, not that I don't want to tell you, but I'm not allowed to say. Do you know which item is missing? This is an item that you are dying to ask, and it is also an item that I'm dying to talk to you about, but the lawyers are telling me that, do not disclose that. But you should know that what we are trying to do, what our target is. If you look at the other figures, you could also conclude your opinion, so I'm not going to give you the specific figures because you will be able to obtain the results if you do your analysis. Not that I don't want to tell you about this, okay? I'm dying to tell, but really, I can't because the lawyers are saying that this has -- this will play a very important leading role. This will lead to other conclusions. So perhaps, a bit later when we have a firm result, we will find an appropriate time to communicate with you all. \r\nDo I need to read out these figures? For the year, the contracted sales is, we predict, HKD 168 billion, a 20% increase. And the other figures, I am not going to go into details, just read it yourself and do your analysis.\r\nNext page is our completion by regions. So you can see this is a detailed property completion by region in terms of proportion and percentages. I have said everything that I need to say, so please don't make this difficult for me. For the things that I can answer, I will answer, and you will know that why I won't be able to answer some of the questions. Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Mr. Hao. If you have any questions, please put up your hand, and please also introduce yourself when you ask the questions.",

In the management team, we have our Chairman, Mr. Hao Jian Min; and the CEO of the Group; Vice Chairman, Mr. Xiao Xiao of the Group; CEO, Mr. Chen Yi; Vice Chairman and our Chief Construction Expert, Mr. Luo Liang; and our CFO, Mr. Nip Yun. And first of all, please welcome Mr. Hao to go over the 2014 business review for all of us.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Jian Min Hao (Executives)】\nDear, friends, and those audience who are watching this on video, good afternoon. I am very happy that we have this opportunity. After the annual result announcement, we have this opportunity to communicate with our investors. First of all, I would like to thank you, all, for your support to China Overseas, and my report today is mainly -- has mainly the 5 sections and you have that PPT on hand. And I'm going to go over it briefly so that we have more time for Q&A session. First part is our annual results. In 2014, the key profit index continued to grow rapidly on a high basis and our performance has again historic record. And over the year, we have realized a total revenue of HKD 120 billion, a year-on-year rise of 45.5% compared to last year. Net profit attributable to shareholders is HKD 27.68 billion and 20.1% rise. And our core profit has increased by 25.6%, reaching HKD 23.83 billion; basic EPS, HKD 3.39, a rise of 20.1%. And the board recommended a year-end dividend of HKD 0.35, an annual dividend of HKD 0.55, an increase year-on-year of 17%. So the dividend accounts for 18.9% of core profit. I am reading this slowly on purpose so that our audience online could hear it carefully. In 2014, we have maintained the ability of great value creation, and gross profit has increased by 0.2% to 32.7%; net profit, 23.1%; core net profit, 19.9%. If excluding the buyback of social housing and funding -- and funds, the adjusted gross margin is 34.3%. Compared to mid-2014, using the same way, same calculation methods, the method is roughly the same. In the chart below it, it shows the dividend. Here, you can see it shows the revenue and profit of the group, and during this period, the property development revenue is HKD 116.25 billion, which accounts for 96.7% of the total revenue, an increase of 47.9%. And rental income has increased by 38.2% to HKD 1.18 billion. Property investment has realized a profit of HKD 6.03 billion, an increase year-on-year, 43.5%.\r\nOn this page, you can see our shareholders equity has risen by 21.2% to HKD 133.33 billion. Net asset book value per share, HKD 16.3, and year-on-year increase of 20.7%. Annual average shareholder return is 22.8%, and we continue to maximize the profit for -- and value creation for the shareholders. By the end of last year, cash on hand is HKD 51.28 billion; long-term liability, HKD 71.99 billion; net gearing ratio, 32.4%. We have continuously realized our target of gearing ratio no higher than 40%, and maintained the healthy level of the financials of the company. \r\nAnd during the year, the group has again received good results from S&P, Moody's and Fitch. And during this volatility of Chinese property market, the healthy financials have really helped us to maintain the high recognition from those professional rating agencies. \r\nIn May and in June, we have issued many -- lots of guaranteed notes and totaling USD 2 billion. We have also complete -- acquired the largest club loan in November, totaling HKD 14 billion. And thanks to the confidence and support of the capital market, we were able to maintain the interest rate at a relatively low level. In terms of our financial resources: cash on hand, RMB 85%; Hong Kong dollars, 2.6%; and U.S. dollars, 12.4%, including unused credit facilities, totaling HKD 11.7 billion. We have financial resources available, HKD 62.98 billion. We have enough reserves for our future development. In terms of bonds, we have corporate bond, HKD 48.18 billion, and bank loans, HKD 46.36 billion. Long-term liabilities with more than 1 year, 76.2 years, and debt structure and repayment cycle are all very healthy. \r\nAnd now let's go over the business for last year. In 2014, we have realized contracted property sales, HKD 140.8 billion. GFA sold, 9.398 million square meters. By end of December, we still have subscribed property sales, HKD 7.77 billion, and waiting to sign the contracts. I should think that they have been signed by today. You look at it by region, South China has -- Southern China has realized HKD 32.96 billion, which has contributed the greatest portion to the profit of the company. For Hong Kong and Macau, contracted sales, HKD 5.06 billion, and our sales collection rate is 88%, totaling HKD 102.09 billion, and maintaining the leader in the market. \r\nAnd now let's look at the completed areas, completed GFA. And in terms of completion, we have -- for the group and our JV projects, we have 51 projects. These are our own projects, and 4 JV products (sic) [projects] and the completed GFA is 10.77 million square meters. By end of December, we have already sold 79.4% of our own project and 90% of the JV projects. \r\nAnd this chart shows you pre-sales and bookings. In terms of bookings, including JV projects, we have 7.78 million property bookings, totaling HKD 131.4 billion. By end of December, including JV projects, we still have 4.12 million square meters project for pre-sale waiting to be completed, and totaling HKD 65.3 billion. \r\nOn this chart, you can see the land acquisition for 2014. The whole year, we have entered Jiangdong, Taiyuan. I don't need to explain this, right? You know where they are located, which province. And in Jinan, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Wuxi, Kunming, Xi'an, we have also acquired another 17 plots of land, and total area for development, 9.04 million square meters and totaling RMB 38.28 billion, and the average land cost is around RMB 4,234 per square meters; it's roughly in line with the average land cost for the past 2 years, which has ensured the profitability going forward.\r\nOn this chart is our land acquisition by end of 2014. Currently, if you add the 14 cities from China Overseas, Hongyang, and we have business in China across 47 cities, including Hong Kong and Macau. In beginning of 2015, we have purchased 2 plots of land. Area for development, 1.625 million, and the land price is RMB 3.56 billion. On this chart, it shows our property investment. Property investment completed, 1.14 million square meters, and the rentals of mature properties are doing well. Office buildings in the Hong Kong, Beijing and Chengdu, and the Unipark shopping malls in Jinan, rental rate have exceeded 90%, and the rental income have increased to HKD 1.18 billion and year-on-year increase of 38.2%. Last year, we have opened the Unipark shopping malls in Shenyang, and rental rate has also climbed up to 90%. And Unipark shopping malls in Nanjing will open its door this year, and other shopping malls in the developed second-tier cities will gradually start business. With our chain operation, we believe that's the brand and influence of China Overseas will continue to improve. So I believe that, for the first part, it is very similar to your expectation. You would have expected this. \r\nAnd this part is something that you always ask me, but I have never really quite responded to your questions recently with regard to asset injection. Today, when we are issuing our result announcement, we have also published the announcement between us and our parent company on asset injection and share subscription, including some acquisition of several real estate projects. And now I'm going to talk to you through this, and there are many -- a few parts. One is the strategic meanings of this transaction for China Overseas. Here, we have listed a few points, some of which might be something that you've already thought about. If there are any things that you feel like we've left out, please tell me. I would like to talk to you about the few points here.\r\nHere, this time after the consolidation, in terms of our resources, we are better distributed between the first, second and third tier cities in China, especially in the first tier cities. And we know that in the past few years, especially in the first tier cities, regardless of how the sales go, the land price is always very high. So for the first tier cities and second tier cities, to continue to acquire land, that will play a very important role in maintaining our leading position in the market. \r\nSecond, in terms of coverage of the regions. With the asset injection, we have 9 cities which are already included so -- which are not included. And it really helps with our countrywide plan and to cover the major economic bouts in the fast developing regions. Well, of course, because, thanks to our brand consolidation, going forward, we could maximize the advantage of our brand, and you could think and imagine how that's going to help us using the same brand. Fourthly, in terms of core competence, because in the past, we've always had very good quality when it comes to cost control and product quality et cetera. Going forward, in those projects, all of these qualities will be exempted again, so it is worth expecting, it is worth waiting for. And finally, this is something that I'm eager to share with you. In the past, I feel that when I was talking to you, perhaps, people didn't really quite understand it, but today, I want to share with you what support really means.\r\nIn terms of the group support, you can see in the announcement, our parent company will no longer participate in direct sales of property business. And this has avoided the possibility of cannibalization. And again, you can see from these arrangements, COLI as one of the important business arms of our parent company. You can really see how important we are to the parent. So based on these reasons mentioned above, I believe that this is a great strategy. Just now, I said if you feel like there's anything that I missed out, please feel free and do tell me about it.\r\nAnd now let's look at the structure of the deal and consideration, and the deal is -- includes 2 parts, asset injection and shares subscription. And asset injection, the total consideration is RMB 1.82 billion, and in terms of the CSCL loans, it amounts to RMB 31.99 billion, and COHL, the parent company, will subscribe to 1.687 billion new shares and at the price of RMB 28.38 price per share. Compared to the market closing price of yesterday, there is -- and this is 10.8% higher than the market closing price of yesterday, and compared to the average market closing price, 10 trading days prior to the announcement of this deal, this is 15.2% higher. This time, the asset injection includes 30 projects, and the total consideration in the CSCL loan is RMB 33.82 billion, and because I worry about some of the differences when it comes to exchange rate, so everything is calculate -- denominated in RMB. And the total GFA is 10.92 million square meters located in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Suzhou, Chengdu, Xi'an, Urumqi, Changsha, Weifang, Zibo and London. Compared to our cities disclosed in the past, the 24 cities, some of them are different, and the total consideration in the CSCL loan is RMB 33.82 billion, and there's one figure I could tell you here. I didn't tell this to the media. For all these asset, our original investment is RMB 31.11 billion. You should understand what I mean here, right? \r\nMoving on to the transactions timeline. Today, we have made the announcement. We predict no later than 17th April, we will dispatch the circular. Well, these are all expected time schedule, so this is just for your reference. And roughly in line with this, I hold myself responsible for everything I say, but I must tell you that this is an estimated timeline. May 5, we will have a General Meeting, and we expect by end of May, this acquisition would be completed.\r\nNext page. These are reasons for completing the deal and benefits that brings us. Perhaps, I should not talk about benefits myself. Perhaps, it is up to you to talk about it, and a few points I would like to share with you here. First, our parent company have completed their consolidation of direct sale -- of their direct sales property industry, and they have confirmed that COLI has the most important real estate business platform, and has eliminated the potential competition between China Overseas, COLI and the parent company. On the other hand, the parent company, as a SOE with great reputation when it comes to property and construction, they have always been giving us great support. After the deal, the parent will continue to give support to us in terms of human resources, financials, financing, business resources and business network, et cetera. When I'm saying this, you should have seen that our parent company have said that they will exit the direct sales of real estate business, and today's A-shares market is completely different from 2 years -- from a few years ago. For a company with a potential of -- a value of RMB 200 billion, where is it going to go? It is worth waiting to see. Second, the deal will complement the land acquisition for COLI. After the deal, our land acquisition have increased by 29.1%, reaching 48.3 million square meters. The land acquisition here does not include our own land development for 2015. \r\nAnd thirdly, the asset injection will bring new impetus for growth for COLI, and in the asset package, there are different -- there are sales property -- property for sales in different phases waiting to be built during construction and small -- and a small portion of investment property. Upon completion of the deal, we believe that this will contribute positively to our contract sales, cash flow, profit growth and income, and these words are said by the lawyers. I am not allowed to say this. I would be able to put it in a more lively fashion, but I'm not allowed to say that, so please just go by the lawyers words. \r\nAnd finally, I would like to tell you that the asset being injected is net cash. And after the deal's completion, the equity foundation will be more solid, and our capital structure will be further improved. Our financials are so healthy that they cannot be further improved. I cannot release specific figures to you. I estimate that even including the Hong Kong, Macau companies, you will not be able to find the companies with better financials than us. On this chart, you can see that the distribution of the asset across China and London, and total GFA is 10.92 million square meters.\r\nMoving on, I don't know if you are interested in this market analysis. If you're not, I can jump this. Should we vote, those who think we should jump the market analysis? Not half of the audience here. So maybe I'll just read it out. So apologies to those who have put up their hand. Just a very simple analysis, a very simple report. I believe, as you have all studied this closely yourselves, and I'm just going to share with you some of the informations that we have. And here, we have outlook on the Chinese macroeconomic situation, and there's one point that I believe that I should share with you. Despite for 2015, the GDP growth target is only 7%, same as when Premier Li were answering the questions. For our country, our GDP growth, even if we have slowed down to 7%, this is already the total aggregate of many other countries. So under this fast speed and the high basis, high benchmark of the current Chinese economy, and we're still able to maintain a relatively high growth, and we are very confident about the future of China's economy, and especially for the new employment being created, which is over 10 million positions, and so that would make sure that -- I'm sure that, that will bring more stable structural demand for the property industry. \r\nAnd here is our market liquidity, and I'm not going to go into details, and here, we have some property outlook. I'm not going to read out it word by word, but I believe that it is still worth reading when you have time. And when it comes to the policy level, what I'm about to say, it is not included on the PPT. I just want to share with you. We believe that the market will become more market-driven in the next few years. And in the past, we normally say that the government will control the government and the market will control the market, and you know that in the past and the Chinese economy and the property market have always been affected by policies, et cetera. Going forward, as one of the most important growth sector, which is the -- which belongs to the consumption as an important index for growth for the Chinese economy, I believe that there is still hope in this market. Second, on the market's demand, it is changing structurally. The property market has also entered into a new normal. In the past, we talk about different demands. For example, structural demand, investment demand, et cetera, and upgrading demand, but actually, the concepts, they are very blurred. \r\nWhat is the project that has really met the structural demand of the consumers? Not many people have studied this. And once that comes out, this will change the market dramatically. And I would like also to say that, going forward, we will be doing very well in terms of getting rid of the inventory. I remember that, in February, across the nation, we still have 600-million-something square meters to be sold, waiting to be sold. And this figure is the figure that we have achieved in 2014, which is a relatively low year for property transactions. So I believe that in the next 1 year to 15 months during this period, these areas will be digested by the market. But I need to tell you in which areas we will be able to get rid of more inventories, and which areas it won't be so successful. So I would like to say that there will be a more clear division between the urban areas and the rural areas in China. This is really affected by many different factors, not only just about the growth of the economy and the population. If you do not study these relevant indexes carefully, there is still a lot of risk when it comes to investing in the Chinese property market. \r\nI know that a lot of people are talking to you, and 5 years ago, and people, I would say that I would only do the first to second tier cities, but some of you might have not understood this 5 years ago. For the Chinese cities development, actually, there is a cycle. If you cannot study the cycle clearly, how can you make sure that you have good operation and good returns on your projects? So the division between the land and the division between cities, going forward, will also be a main theme of the market. And lastly, the concentration will become more and more tense a few years. I told you we had 50 thousand [ph] companies in the market, and I've already said we can't have so many companies in the market in terms of time, in terms of region. These are all factors will contribute to the consolidation of the companies, and today, I think the consolidation is about to happen. For the property market, a market, there was no competition. This is not a mature market. This is not a healthy market nor is it a healthy competition. Why am I telling you this? A company's core competence will be changed during this process. After the past 5 years of consolidation, both internally and externally, for COLI, this time's asset injection, actually, we have also completed the internal asset consolidation. If you look at the asset distribution, this is not a small company. We are bigger than medium-sized companies. There aren't so many companies with so much reserves. \r\nSo one of the core competence that COLI possesses is our ability to consolidate, both internally and externally. Our parent companies business, the team of over hundreds of people, they have already joined us and they are doing very well. Today, I can tell you this. So these are things that is not included in the PPT. You can read the PPT after the meeting when you have more time. \r\nAnd the last part is on the value chain management. Well, actually, I've told you about this in the past about the value chain method and the model, but what I would like to tell you is our new management and our new operation model. You can put this in your internal report, but do not release it to the outside. I have heard that some companies are copying this. I would like to share this with you because I think it is meaningful for your report, but I really hope that you will not tell this to others, especially my peers. I'm not afraid of them. Some of the stuff, they just can't learn. They're not able to learn, but because I tell so much to you guys, so please, please do not tell this to others, and let's consider that as part of the goodwill.\r\nWell, finally, on guidance for 2015. For our target this year, there's one thing that's missing, one figure, not that I don't want to tell you, but I'm not allowed to say. Do you know which item is missing? This is an item that you are dying to ask, and it is also an item that I'm dying to talk to you about, but the lawyers are telling me that, do not disclose that. But you should know that what we are trying to do, what our target is. If you look at the other figures, you could also conclude your opinion, so I'm not going to give you the specific figures because you will be able to obtain the results if you do your analysis. Not that I don't want to tell you about this, okay? I'm dying to tell, but really, I can't because the lawyers are saying that this has -- this will play a very important leading role. This will lead to other conclusions. So perhaps, a bit later when we have a firm result, we will find an appropriate time to communicate with you all. \r\nDo I need to read out these figures? For the year, the contracted sales is, we predict, HKD 168 billion, a 20% increase. And the other figures, I am not going to go into details, just read it yourself and do your analysis.\r\nNext page is our completion by regions. So you can see this is a detailed property completion by region in terms of proportion and percentages. I have said everything that I need to say, so please don't make this difficult for me. For the things that I can answer, I will answer, and you will know that why I won't be able to answer some of the questions. Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nThank you, Mr. Hao. If you have any questions, please put up your hand, and please also introduce yourself when you ask the questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "Mr. Hao, I'm Wang, Danielle from DBS. I have a few questions that I would like to ask. In terms of the asset injection, I don't know if you can really tell us more. And for 2015, in terms of the revenue and -- of the bookings, how much can it contribute? And in the market, people are saying that the gross margin is quite low for this round of asset of injection, and what is your view, and for 2016, and can you give us some figures? That will be great. Second, when we talk about the payment method, actually, we believe that COLI has a lot of cash yourself. And you've decided to issue new shares for financing this time, and what are the considerations behind this? Because you want to save more cash to purchase more land or is it because you think there will be more opportunities this year in the market? And thirdly, we all have also seen that M&A is one of the most important strategies for COLI going forward. So in this regard, is this for that the parent will continue to inject asset or there will be other forms of M&A in the market? And these are my questions for now.\n\n---\n\nThank you. The first question is very difficult. I really can't tell you the detailed figures. But 2 information, 2 pieces of information I could tell you. First, from October or November 2013, I can't remember this clearly, when we have announced about this, and what have we been doing for the 1.5 years, actually, besides obtaining approval, applying for approval, registration, we are replanning, repositioning these projects. Based on our professional abilities in the past, some of the projects, we are redoing it. So for 1.5 years, for 1 project, we -- and 1 plot of land, we have basically redone it completely. So whatever you have heard in the market, that is all history. You need to adopt a new attitude towards this, and based on your experience to make a new judgment. I can only tell you, I can only describe to you in sentence. I have the figure, but I can't tell you the figure, I can't give you the figure. I'm not allowed to say anything because it is very leading the information. So if you understood what I've just said, actually, I will have answered all your questions. For the rumors, you've heard about the gross margin and the revenue, et cetera. Please do a new analysis based on your experience. I am being very responsible because this is something that I cannot hide from you. You will be able to see this. There's no need for me to lie, so I hope that I've answered your question. Second, in terms of payment, I think there are 2 points I would like to share with you. First, this has really reflected the real support coming from the parent. Why I have told you 2 figures during my report? One is that the total asset is HKD 33 billion and the actual investment is HKD 31.1 billion. During the process and for the past 5 years, what kind of changes has the Chinese market undergone? Do I need to elaborate that for you guys? In terms of cash consideration, what time is it? Has the market closed yet? Please, if you look at the price, if you look at the market price, you will understand why we didn't take cash, but then we went for the stocks. Yesterday, we had 18 point -- sorry, apologies. We had 10.8% higher. And for the parent, they hold the stocks at the price of HKD 25. What does that mean? That, perhaps, that obviously shows that they don't think the stock price is expensive. Otherwise, they wouldn't have gone for the cash alternative. We didn't take a cent. Can you see any other parent company that would be so supportive in the world? Have I answered your questions? I believe I have. Well, thirdly, about the future, I haven't really looked at the price of the parent company, but they are worth HKD 200 billion in the market, but they have said that they will no longer participate in the direct sales of property market. Will they have -- take some actions in the future? I can't answer you. But in terms of resources, I can tell you that they will be supporting us 100%. And in terms of external consolidation, I can tell you, we are having discussions with others, but I can't really tell you, we are looking at it, but you should also know that our management team, we have been spoiled. We won't be taking those projects that are too expensive. So we are negotiating at the moment. Once I have some more specific information, I will share with you. Next question, please.\n\n---\n\nI am David Ng coming from Macquarie, and I would like to again focus on the new project or the asset and COLI. You used to have a subsidiary. And your subsidiary, actually, they -- their projects are located in some of the cities that you are also in at the moment, and these projects are kind of related -- located in the remote areas, and if it overlaps, there will be potentially 2 problems. So first, for those companies, those remote areas, why don't you inject it to COGO? And second, if those are big projects, to inject them into COLI, but the turnover may not be as high as the first tier and second tier cities. So in terms of your ROA and ROE, and perhaps, that will suffer. So these are 2 questions based on assumptions. And in 2014, on your account receivable, it has increased greatly. This is because there are more installment payment or it's because you have sold more commercial projects, that's why you have a higher AR?\n\n---\n\nThank you very much for your question. And for account receivables, some of our journalists have already asked it, and our CFO will answer your question. You will have no doubt about it after he finishes. So actually, your first 2 questions, they are the same question, under the same thread line. Today is the meeting for COLI. I don't want to talk about COGO because it is quite difficult for me to answer questions on COGO's behalf, but I can tell you, everything is possible. So the future trend, what is it? I cannot tell you directly. We have the thoughts. We have the thinkings, and we have the purpose. In the specific projects, I have actually answered the question in terms of acquisition and consideration and what are our thinkings behind those projects. We have already prepared. We believe that it will not bring a big effect on the ROA or ROE on the company. We have already made new arrangement for those projects, so I don't think you should worry about it. But what will happen, I cannot say. Just remember everything is possible. And Horace, please answer the question about account receivable.\n\n---\n\nIn terms of the AR, on one hand, we -- you can see that, for the market situation, the liquidity was very tight, and there's tightening in the market, so it takes longer time to receive the cash. So there is some effect on the AR. On the other hand, last year, we have a project in Macau. And we have already issued the contract and waiting for them to pay for the property owners, and here, HKD 2 billion comes from the project by end of Macau -- by end of last year. And for the HKD 2 billion, we have already received 20% of that, so please do not worry about it. And overall speaking, we're very satisfied. Next question, please.\n\n---\n\nI'm Ryan from JPMorgan. I have 2 questions for COLI. For 2014, the environment is still quite tough, and a lot of companies, their gross profit margin has dropped. And so looking at the situation, Mr. Hao, what do you think about it? And second, Mr. Hao, COLI, your view on third tier cities during different times, you have different attitudes. So going forward, do you think COLI will be suitable to develop in third tier cities?\n\n---\n\nWell, thank you. You guys are not satisfied if I don't answer those questions. Well, for 2014, everyone has their analysis about the market. I believe that, in recent days, the real estate companies are also issuing their results. And I believe that there are a lot of differences, quite a lot of gaps between those companies. So in summary, it's been a very tough market. And in this backdrop, there's one thing that I always wanted to share with you. If you are doing a business that's not making money, the bigger your scale is, the riskier it is. For real estate industry, it is, on one hand, a production industry. On the other hand, it is also consumption, and both sides need cycles. So you can see that our gross margin in this backdrop is still satisfactory. To be honest, whether it is me or the management team of COLI, this is something that we have a consensus on. We always maintain it at a level that we are very satisfied with. Not only that we are being responsible for the shareholders, but also, that if we are not careful, the profit margin will drop greatly. So in this backdrop, we are going to maintain on the same direction of pursuit. I remember, last year, after the interim results, some of the friend have asked me about what is your target, can you exceed or meet your target? And I have said, \"Well, my job is to complete the target.\" But what I can tell you though, what I'm actually trying to say, the hidden meaning is that if there is good price, good return, of course, I want to sell. If the market, and if the market doesn't have this kind of conditions, selling some of the projects, that I will retain it. Well, it is also possible if it matches, right? And I could have made HKD 150 billion in -- or HKD 160 billion. How come I didn't sell? I just want to maximize my profit, and I want the company to have a very healthy financials. We have this arrangement. Why don't we go for the profit maximization? This is a direction issue because, in the past, for the past -- over 10 years, we have always maintained this trend, and this is also something that we would insist on going forward. With regard to the third tier cities, well, I've actually shared a little bit of my thoughts on this during my PPT presentation, but what I didn't tell is something that I was quite specific about. It can be said that -- you cannot say, first tier cities are definitely good, second tier cities are definitely great, and third cities -- third tier cities are definitely great. This is not objective. In first tier cities, aren't there property companies who died? There are many of them, not just 1 or 2, and in third tier cities, there are also property companies who have managed. So it is not objective to summarize it. For this market, there are some specific characteristics. So to say accurately how is this company, how is this city, you need to look at it case-by-case. You can't -- well, of course, we know that, in the past, for third tier cities in China, due to their geographic location or some of the JV projects, et cetera, they have been affected badly, but I've never thought that these cities do not have any potential. They just need more arrangement. Like I said, all the first tier cities are good, and the mainstream first tier cities, let alone Guangzhou, Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, are there companies who are not losing? Of course, there are. And actually, there are quite a lot of them. Like I said, you know you need to look at it case-by-case. Perhaps this will help you with your analysis. What I've told you is the fact. I hope that you could also be more specific in your report, which city, which project, and to do a more detailed analysis, and that's how you really reflect your professional conduct. In the future, with the investors becoming more wise, are becoming wiser, your value will be maximized. And this afternoon, some of the journalists, some of their questions, you could tell -- some of them, they have only just entered into this profession, and some of them have really asked the questions after studying it carefully. So for me, I really hope that all of you present, you could become the elite of the property industry in China because you have so much information. No one in the property market has as much information as you guys, so please treasure your time. And due to time constraint, we'll invite the last question.\n\n---\n\nMr. Hao, I have 2 or 3 questions. The first one is that in your announcement, you mentioned the company that you acquired in 2013, it made HKD 1.3 billion. In 2014, they've lost HKD 400 million, and how come there's such a big difference? I know that you can't say much about this, but please, can you briefly tell us something. For COLI, you have done well in Hong Kong recently. So I would like to ask about your strategy in Hong Kong, Macau? And you have also injected asset in London as well. And thirdly, a lot of property companies are talking about diversification, and some of them have also talked so much about the Internet. And I want to ask COLI, what are your views on this and what is your focus going forward?\n\n---\n\nThese are all great questions. I believe a lot of you here are very attentive to those questions. I can't tell you more specific figures. But if you could see the timeline, in 21 calendar days, this circular will tell you very clearly why this situation has emerged. There's one thing I could tell you. How come this kind of situation is here? How come this is happening? Two possibilities. There is no profit contribution. Where is the profit contribution? Think about it. Where did it go? Another property -- another possibility, what about impairment? How did you calculate the impairment? Think about it. I have answered 70% to 80% of this. I don't think I've disobeyed any rules, but I believe that I have answered your questions. This is all I can say. In terms of overseas strategy, what I want to share with you here, so far, in terms of investment, we have not adjusted. If -- there's no material adjustment. If there is, I will communicate with you, and how come we have these 3 overseas projects? I can tell you some -- a little bit more about it, and these are properties that are there to collect the rentals, they're purely for rents. After the circular, after the announcement, I can tell you more. These 3 properties, we acquired them to increase the rental income proportion of our portfolio. So since this has already been announced by the announcement, there are 2 reasons. On one hand, for Hong Kong and London's investment, from the commercial environment, there are a lot of similarities. So for a company that we really grew up in Hong Kong, we are very familiar with London. In the past, we thought there must be a lot of cultural differences, but actually, once we've entered into that market, we've realized it is very similar to Hong Kong, but in order to be prudent and not to take risks, we have decided that in the short term, we're not going to develop properties overseas. We've decided to acquire mature properties to increase the rental portion of our portfolio because, in the past, I have told you that we hope -- I hope that the 20%, we could obtain 20% revenue from our rentals income. So just look at it as a rental property rather than any changes going on in our overseas investment. So please just focus on this part. And finally, in recent year, and Internet has become very popular. It is magical, I also feel so. It feels like anything can become amazing once it touches the word Internet. Even if it used to be a company that was not successful, are they not worried that would be electrified? Do you really have the professional ability? Anything new, anything new can't -- anything that has a new concept, you really need to be careful and you really need to do your research. So I think for enterprise, they have some innovative ideas, but we haven't stopped our innovation. It's just that we are in a different industry. We are not against any new products, but I see all of these as tools, as instruments, instruments that can be used by you. They will create profits, but if they can't be useful to you, then you will be hurt by it. I don't force you to accept my ideas. If you think that I've lacked behind the time, I'm happy to receive your advice on this, and in terms of impairment -- impairment, we have HKD 2.5 billion. This is already in our announcement, and I truly believe all of you present, you understand what I'm saying. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you, everyone, and this is the end of today's result announcement. Thank you very much.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Danielle Wang (Analysts)】\nMr. Hao, I'm Wang, Danielle from DBS. I have a few questions that I would like to ask. In terms of the asset injection, I don't know if you can really tell us more. And for 2015, in terms of the revenue and -- of the bookings, how much can it contribute? And in the market, people are saying that the gross margin is quite low for this round of asset of injection, and what is your view, and for 2016, and can you give us some figures? That will be great. Second, when we talk about the payment method, actually, we believe that COLI has a lot of cash yourself. And you've decided to issue new shares for financing this time, and what are the considerations behind this? Because you want to save more cash to purchase more land or is it because you think there will be more opportunities this year in the market? And thirdly, we all have also seen that M&A is one of the most important strategies for COLI going forward. So in this regard, is this for that the parent will continue to inject asset or there will be other forms of M&A in the market? And these are my questions for now.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jian Min Hao (Executives)】\nThank you. The first question is very difficult. I really can't tell you the detailed figures. But 2 information, 2 pieces of information I could tell you. First, from October or November 2013, I can't remember this clearly, when we have announced about this, and what have we been doing for the 1.5 years, actually, besides obtaining approval, applying for approval, registration, we are replanning, repositioning these projects. Based on our professional abilities in the past, some of the projects, we are redoing it. So for 1.5 years, for 1 project, we -- and 1 plot of land, we have basically redone it completely. So whatever you have heard in the market, that is all history. You need to adopt a new attitude towards this, and based on your experience to make a new judgment. I can only tell you, I can only describe to you in sentence. I have the figure, but I can't tell you the figure, I can't give you the figure. I'm not allowed to say anything because it is very leading the information. So if you understood what I've just said, actually, I will have answered all your questions. For the rumors, you've heard about the gross margin and the revenue, et cetera. Please do a new analysis based on your experience. I am being very responsible because this is something that I cannot hide from you. You will be able to see this. There's no need for me to lie, so I hope that I've answered your question. Second, in terms of payment, I think there are 2 points I would like to share with you. First, this has really reflected the real support coming from the parent. Why I have told you 2 figures during my report? One is that the total asset is HKD 33 billion and the actual investment is HKD 31.1 billion. During the process and for the past 5 years, what kind of changes has the Chinese market undergone? Do I need to elaborate that for you guys? In terms of cash consideration, what time is it? Has the market closed yet? Please, if you look at the price, if you look at the market price, you will understand why we didn't take cash, but then we went for the stocks. Yesterday, we had 18 point -- sorry, apologies. We had 10.8% higher. And for the parent, they hold the stocks at the price of HKD 25. What does that mean? That, perhaps, that obviously shows that they don't think the stock price is expensive. Otherwise, they wouldn't have gone for the cash alternative. We didn't take a cent. Can you see any other parent company that would be so supportive in the world? Have I answered your questions? I believe I have. Well, thirdly, about the future, I haven't really looked at the price of the parent company, but they are worth HKD 200 billion in the market, but they have said that they will no longer participate in the direct sales of property market. Will they have -- take some actions in the future? I can't answer you. But in terms of resources, I can tell you that they will be supporting us 100%. And in terms of external consolidation, I can tell you, we are having discussions with others, but I can't really tell you, we are looking at it, but you should also know that our management team, we have been spoiled. We won't be taking those projects that are too expensive. So we are negotiating at the moment. Once I have some more specific information, I will share with you. Next question, please.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Ng (Analysts)】\nI am David Ng coming from Macquarie, and I would like to again focus on the new project or the asset and COLI. You used to have a subsidiary. And your subsidiary, actually, they -- their projects are located in some of the cities that you are also in at the moment, and these projects are kind of related -- located in the remote areas, and if it overlaps, there will be potentially 2 problems. So first, for those companies, those remote areas, why don't you inject it to COGO? And second, if those are big projects, to inject them into COLI, but the turnover may not be as high as the first tier and second tier cities. So in terms of your ROA and ROE, and perhaps, that will suffer. So these are 2 questions based on assumptions. And in 2014, on your account receivable, it has increased greatly. This is because there are more installment payment or it's because you have sold more commercial projects, that's why you have a higher AR?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jian Min Hao (Executives)】\nThank you very much for your question. And for account receivables, some of our journalists have already asked it, and our CFO will answer your question. You will have no doubt about it after he finishes. So actually, your first 2 questions, they are the same question, under the same thread line. Today is the meeting for COLI. I don't want to talk about COGO because it is quite difficult for me to answer questions on COGO's behalf, but I can tell you, everything is possible. So the future trend, what is it? I cannot tell you directly. We have the thoughts. We have the thinkings, and we have the purpose. In the specific projects, I have actually answered the question in terms of acquisition and consideration and what are our thinkings behind those projects. We have already prepared. We believe that it will not bring a big effect on the ROA or ROE on the company. We have already made new arrangement for those projects, so I don't think you should worry about it. But what will happen, I cannot say. Just remember everything is possible. And Horace, please answer the question about account receivable.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Yun Wing Nip (Executives)】\nIn terms of the AR, on one hand, we -- you can see that, for the market situation, the liquidity was very tight, and there's tightening in the market, so it takes longer time to receive the cash. So there is some effect on the AR. On the other hand, last year, we have a project in Macau. And we have already issued the contract and waiting for them to pay for the property owners, and here, HKD 2 billion comes from the project by end of Macau -- by end of last year. And for the HKD 2 billion, we have already received 20% of that, so please do not worry about it. And overall speaking, we're very satisfied. Next question, please.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Lok Hang Li (Analysts)】\nI'm Ryan from JPMorgan. I have 2 questions for COLI. For 2014, the environment is still quite tough, and a lot of companies, their gross profit margin has dropped. And so looking at the situation, Mr. Hao, what do you think about it? And second, Mr. Hao, COLI, your view on third tier cities during different times, you have different attitudes. So going forward, do you think COLI will be suitable to develop in third tier cities?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Jian Min Hao (Executives)】\nWell, thank you. You guys are not satisfied if I don't answer those questions. Well, for 2014, everyone has their analysis about the market. I believe that, in recent days, the real estate companies are also issuing their results. And I believe that there are a lot of differences, quite a lot of gaps between those companies. So in summary, it's been a very tough market. And in this backdrop, there's one thing that I always wanted to share with you. If you are doing a business that's not making money, the bigger your scale is, the riskier it is. For real estate industry, it is, on one hand, a production industry. On the other hand, it is also consumption, and both sides need cycles. So you can see that our gross margin in this backdrop is still satisfactory. To be honest, whether it is me or the management team of COLI, this is something that we have a consensus on. We always maintain it at a level that we are very satisfied with. Not only that we are being responsible for the shareholders, but also, that if we are not careful, the profit margin will drop greatly. So in this backdrop, we are going to maintain on the same direction of pursuit. I remember, last year, after the interim results, some of the friend have asked me about what is your target, can you exceed or meet your target? And I have said, \"Well, my job is to complete the target.\" But what I can tell you though, what I'm actually trying to say, the hidden meaning is that if there is good price, good return, of course, I want to sell. If the market, and if the market doesn't have this kind of conditions, selling some of the projects, that I will retain it. Well, it is also possible if it matches, right? And I could have made HKD 150 billion in -- or HKD 160 billion. How come I didn't sell? I just want to maximize my profit, and I want the company to have a very healthy financials. We have this arrangement. Why don't we go for the profit maximization? This is a direction issue because, in the past, for the past -- over 10 years, we have always maintained this trend, and this is also something that we would insist on going forward. With regard to the third tier cities, well, I've actually shared a little bit of my thoughts on this during my PPT presentation, but what I didn't tell is something that I was quite specific about.

I hope that you could also be more specific in your report, which city, which project, and to do a more detailed analysis, and that's how you really reflect your professional conduct. In the future, with the investors becoming more wise, are becoming wiser, your value will be maximized. And this afternoon, some of the journalists, some of their questions, you could tell -- some of them, they have only just entered into this profession, and some of them have really asked the questions after studying it carefully.

For those who are familiar with us, we'll have a presentation first and then we'll have a question-and-answer time later. \r\nLet me just quickly say, for the Q&A, we will ask you all to wait for the microphones because we'll have a simultaneous interpretation. You may ask questions in English, Cantonese or Mandarin. Again, please do wait for the mic to come so the translator can hear what you're asking. And we also ask you just to help us keep track and know who's interested, who's coming, to give your name and organization when you put your question. \r\nI think without further ado, let me ask and invite Charles to come forward with the presentation.\n\n---\n\nThank you very much for attending our earnings announcement today. I will very quickly make a broad introduction, and then Paul will walk you through our financials, and then I'll come back and touch on some of the strategic issues, but at the end mostly is really Q&As for all of you.\r\nOkay, this -- something is wrong here. Can you figure that out? Okay, great. I think -- this one doesn't work either. Okay. You got it? Perfect, yes. \r\nVery quickly, on the overall key achievement of 2014, both financial and otherwise. Our revenue and other income up 13%, mainly driven by increasing ADT and also related revenue increases. A record fund-raising year. This is really -- we're second globally in IPOs. I think this is even in the absence of some of the real big, large transactions. And we raised over HKD 900 million. This is a truly a record. \r\nSuccessfully launched the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect. Enhancement are now being implemented as we speak. \r\nLME commercialization in very, very solid and good progress. LME Clear launched, and with about 1/4 of operations this year. And overall ADT and LME hit a record high as well. \r\nIntroduced a 3 London Metal Exchange mini contracts in Asia. And this is really the first step for us to build out the commodity -- overall, the commodity win of LME.\r\nThis is really just a very quick breakdown on cash equity, derivative market and commodities. As you can see, volume has been growing quite solidly, both in the cash market and derivative market. I think if you look at the LME commodity product, the red, looks like this is the 700,000 vis-a-vis 676,000 is a very solid increase. The first quarter and actually the first couple of months still continued to saw very strong growth. You see the red, it seems to be dipping a little bit. That's actually is a little bit misleading. The number 2014 is the whole year number and the 696,000 is year-to-date, including a very big Chinese New Year holiday. Usually that's a slow time for LME. If you compare same period against the last period, LME is actually up more than close to 70%, 80% in terms of volume. \r\nSo very strong cash market ADT increase last year. Derivatives increased -- ADT increased 8%, commodity 4%, very solid year. And also, Paul will also walk you through on the financials, clearly indicating not only revenue is up, our revenue is up, outpacing ADT. And also partially, obviously as a result of a decrease in the trend of increase of the trend -- the growth of cost is smaller than -- significantly smaller than the growth of revenue. So as a result, we see very strong overall financial performance for 2014.\r\nAnd I will ask Paul to give you highlights of the year on financials first. Paul?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Charles. \r\nWell, the first thing is that I'm extremely pleased to stand here with such a great set of results. We nearly hit $10 billion, which would have been the first time. This is the highest income we've ever earned. Going back to 2007, we came close. But $9.8 billion, heading to $10 billion, and I'm sure we're going to beat that next year. \r\nAcross the whole slide here, I think it's a set of positive results. Trading volumes and revenue have obviously increased, but we had a particularly strong fourth quarter, really following the more positive sentiment in the Mainland. And also following the positive sentiment generated by the announcement of Stock Connect in November, we had a significant increase in ADT and activity generally. We had the 11 trading days where we hit over 100 billion a day, which we haven't seen for quite some time.\r\nSo revenue significantly up 13%. It's 28% higher than the fourth quarter of 2013. A number of factors have really driven growth this year. And our results whilst I believe they're good, I don't think they're controversial. They pretty much follow what we have seen in terms of activities of the group. \r\nWe launched LME Clear in 22nd of September, a really significant turning point for us. We've been building that system for a couple of years, and we've now had 1 quarter's revenue contribute to our earnings, and that's seen a clear jump. That added close to $200 million, $187 million of clearing income, trading income.\r\nWe also had a record capital raising year, an absolute record, $943 billion. We were second in the IPO market, but the secondary capital raising took us to a new record. And that's flowed through into our listing-related income and the income that's related to that, the IPO income and the brokerage income that's related to those new issues. That in total contributed around $100 million. \r\nWe've also seen an improvement in the interest rate environment this year. We've seen an average increase in the margin fees we've earned. And overall, looking at the Hong Kong investment of those funds, we've made about $180 million more. \r\nIn LME, there's been some investment income, but that tends to relate to gains on the holding of LCH, which is separately reported throughout our results. \r\nThe increase in ADT was felt across the piece. It's felt in the trading income, in the clearing income. And it has a spin off effect in other income like depository fees, especially in the fourth quarter. So our ADT was up by 11%, but overall, our trading and clearing fees were up by a higher percentage. \r\nDepository fees gone up by around $100 million and platform and infrastructure sales also by $100 million. And I think the importance of some of these numbers and the reason for giving you some of this breakdown is that the increase in our income this year, 45% of that increase came from nontrading activities, which I think is a particularly good result.\r\nAs we look at costs, operating expenses, these are under control. They've gone up by 7%. The number is slightly flatted by the fact that we had a recovery of amounts due from Lehman of $77 million this year. But net-net, considering that we were still building out LME Clear, LME is still going through a retooling process, and we're continuing to make investments. A 7% growth in operating costs in this year, I think, is a solid result. And as a consequence of revenue exceeding that, we see, flowing across the page significant increases in EBITDA and profit attributable to shareholders. And I think it's also important to note this year that the value given back to shareholders comes not just through the earnings per share, but by the fact that our share price has also gone up by 33%.\r\nThis is just a breakdown of the revenue and income as shown in our financial statements. I don't want to dwell on this too much. The trading fees obviously come primarily off the ADT. Just to note that the cash equity business was stronger than the 7%. The derivative business was rather flat. That's due to the mix. Even though we had record volumes in the derivative business in terms of the number of trades, the mix was on the lower fee side. Basically, the options grew faster than the futures. \r\nListing fees, I think it's obvious from the volumes. Clearing and settlement fees off the ADT, the higher volumes were also with that contribution of $187 million from LME Clear.\r\nScrip and depository fees gone up significantly this year, basically on increased activity in the market; market data fees, a modest increase; and other revenue and sundry income includes $50 million -- just under $50 million of income directly related to Stock Connect related to throttle sales that participants purchased for the purpose of equipping themselves for the launch of Stock Connect. Net investment income obviously up significantly, which I touched on just now.\r\nLooking at expenses. Staff costs up by 15%. On the face of it, quite significant, but when you consider that we have increased or we've doubled the headcount of LME over 2 years. We launched LME Clear, came on stream during the year. We had some increase in Hong Kong as a result of the initiatives we've been taking, not a surprising number. And in terms of our overall increase in costs, kept within the 7% total increase. \r\nWe've seen a reduction in IT and computer maintenance expenses that is helped by an initiative with LME to in-source exchanging, which is their external IT supplier. We've taken internally around 85 headcount. That is partly the reason for the staff costs increase, but we've seen a corresponding reduction in our IT costs. \r\nPremises expenses have gone down slightly. We've renegotiated the rent on some of our property. \r\nLegal and professional fees, we've seen an increase largely because of litigation. We spent $43 million on litigation last year as opposed to $15 million the year before. You may have seen the announcement this morning about some of the results of that U.S. litigation, so we're hoping that, that won't go any higher. \r\nOther operating expenses are a small reduction. \r\nIn depreciation, we've seen an increase of $140 million. This is a result of investments we've been making over the past few years, including LME Clear, but also including the Iran market data center and other projects we're launching here. \r\nSo some of the build outs from the capital expenditure we've been incurring in prior years are now coming through to launch. That included the last part of our data center in Tseung Kwan O, came on stream in the last quarter of 2013, and we'd seen that come through into depreciation. \r\nOur depreciation will continue to tick up, but we've peaked in terms of our CapEx expenditure at least for the time being.\r\nI like this slide. Everything's going in the right direction. As I mentioned, a really record quarter. It's not quite the highest quarter we've ever had, but definitely, all lines going in the right direction. And as you look at this graph, if you look at the period between the first quarter of 2013 and the current quarter, the revenue has increased by 24%. Our costs have increased by 17%. So over that period, our revenue growth has exceeded our cost growth, which is producing the greater returns we're now seeing. But I would also point out that we have just launched 2 initiatives from our U.K. purchase of LME, which will bring greater returns in the future. LME Clear fired up 1 quarter's income. It will be a full year next year. And LME has gone through a fee commercialization process, which kicks in or has kicked in from the 1st of January. So I think over that period where we've been investing, we still managed to grow our income and managed our costs. And hopefully, we'll now see the fruit of those initiatives coming through.\r\nPerformance by operating segment, no surprises. Cash equity, which had a strong year off the back of the ADT growth, we've seen an increase in the EBITDA margin. \r\nEquity and financial derivatives equally off ADT growth, a small increase in profitability. \r\nCommodities has seen a small decrease, that's not a surprise to us. We've seen some expenditure in here. We've seen some litigation costs. We've seen the launch of the Asia commodities initiatives in Hong Kong with the LME minis, so we've been spending and investing in this segment. That should improve next year as the commercialization of LME introduces higher fees. \r\nClearings had a very good year, partly off investments, partly off volumes, but also that 1 quarter of LME Clear's income that has kicked in. \r\nPlatform and infrastructure, relatively small numbers, but nevertheless, a pleasing improvement in the margin in this segment. \r\nOverall, the group has improved its EBITDA margin by a whole 2%. We've gone back to the rate we were at several years ago where we're operating an EBITDA margin of 70%.\r\nOne of the most significant things that has happened this year, as I mentioned at the beginning, is the commencement of the operations of LME Clear. And it's not just the income effect which is significant, it's also the impact on our balance sheet. \r\nAnd I show here the impact of LME Clear in 2 ways. First of all, the amount of collateral, the margin that they take from the market is very significant, nearly USD 10 billion. That's the $75 billion green box on this graph. Also, because of the nature of the derivative contracts at LME Clear, clears through its clearinghouse, they are not able to net all of the contracts against each other for the purpose of accounting. Their contracts settle gross, the contracts we deal with here settle net. The difference in accounting treatment has resulted in HKD 60 billion of derivative contracts being recorded on either side of our balance sheet. There is no net effect on our balance sheet. They're recorded on either side, assets and liabilities. Interestingly, just to put it in perspective, the gross value of the derivative contracts cleared by LME at the end of December was HKD 1.2 trillion. So the balances have been netted down to $60 billion, but nevertheless, that difference in accounting treatment has resulted in our balance sheet going from an $86 billion asset balance sheet to a $252 billion asset balance sheet.\r\nI'll now hand back to Charles. And at the end, we'll be happy to take questions.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Paul. \r\nWhat I will do before we open up for questions is that we start to see a real strong set of result and we are on the verge of breaking into, for the first time, $10 billion revenue. We're very excited about it. We're absolutely certain, next year, we will get there, and it's a really a matter of still how much more than the $10 billion magic number on the revenue side. \r\nBut I wanted to spend a few minutes, particularly with our analysts, because I did spend quite a bit of time with our media friends about a month ago about our strategy and outlook. I wanted to basically put our business, and particularly, this set of revenues in the perspective of the past and present and where we are going from here and why we think -- where we should be looking at the changes in the dynamics of our various part of our business. \r\nI think we -- I wanted to talk about the overall full period of our history very quickly and then put into the perspective as to where -- to what -- why we're doing many of the things we're doing today. \r\nI think that if you think about the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong market in general, it's really a 4 big areas -- 4 big eras. The IPO era back started in the 1993 to about 20-some years. From a $3 trillion market, we become a $26 trillion market today. In this period, in that first period, we essentially are doing just one thing. We basically bring China equity into Hong Kong. We raised equity for Chinese enterprises, and then they give us the paper. We trade that paper to secondary market, and we become a very strong international market by participation from international investors in that initial equity raising by China Inc. and then we trade. So today, our market cap up 60% the Chinese companies and 70% ADTs are Chinese companies. That's really our business, our market, our era, first era in our development. And one key distinction of that period vis-a-vis today is a complete segregation of the 2 markets.\r\nThen we start to see a significant growth of the domestic market, partially financed by us, obviously, the entire industry growth, China's GDP growth and international funds flow into Mainland from IPO process -- proceeds, FDIs and many other things that really drive domestic growth. But meanwhile, a very important part of the second stage is that domestic capital market become very, very big and growing much faster. And it started about the same time with us, but is really taking off. The domestic equity market, for example, today, is already about the second largest in size, and in terms of its daily trading volumes, as you know, in the last few months, it has actually reached RMB 1 trillion for a couple of days. And the commodity market also is also becoming extremely strong. The 3 commodity market today, almost all of them have very strong contract, at least in terms of number of contract. Whether those commodity exchanges truly service China's underlying economic needs is a different story, but in terms of the actual capital market, the commodity capital market, financial market, the derivative market in particular, have become extremely strong. And in terms of number of contracts traded there, many of the contract, they traded #1 in the world. CFFEX, the CSI 300 for example, is really the biggest traded derivative contracts in the world. And the 3 domestic commodity exchanges, if you put all of their trading volumes together, they are larger than -- they're 3x of CME, they're 3x of LME and ICE. And even individually, they really are 1 or 2 or #2, #1, #2, #3 globally. \r\nSo the second growth era in the last -- in between 2001 and 2010 has really created a domestic capital market that we have to think long and hard what does it mean to us in Hong Kong? What does it mean for our existing business in equity? What does it mean for the business that we don't yet already have, which is fixed income and currency and commodities? \r\nAnd also in this second stage of growth, China start to really begin to experiment the opening through the launch of QFIIs and QDIIs.\r\nAnd now we really in the last 5 years, we start to see a dramatic acceleration, not only of the growth of the market in China but is really the opening up of the domestic market, the internationalization of the renminbi, the development of the Free Trade Zone in Shanghai and now potentially in the number of other areas. And the international investors are really invite -- created the situations for international investors to come in and for their investors to go out. The QFIIs are being considered to be increased and the QDIIs are considered to be increased. So the domestic investors are eagerly trying to begin to prepare to invest beyond China, and the international investors are giving more and more access to go into China. But the most important and the most fastest growth is really coming in the opening up of the renminbi. I think we will see in the coming weeks and months significant acceleration in announcing new changes in internationalization of renminbi. It will becoming a lot easier to convert renminbi, to change renminbi. Today, we have China Clear through the Connect program have to come to Hong Kong to exchange into renminbi offshore. We could see that change over not too far into the future, that potentially, they could change that in onshore into renminbi. And the offshore broker-dealers, offshore -- and the CCASS and many other institutions could be allowed to potentially go up and onshore exchange into renminbi at some time in the future months to come.\r\nSo this accelerated growth, accelerated opening of China's market is really giving us tremendous amount of pressure and tremendous amount of challenge as to how we need to respond. Because clearly, our business model here, which is really raising capital for them, is no longer going to serve Hong Kong in the new era where they need international investors to go in, and they want their investors to go out. And Hong Kong, what exactly is the role that we are going to play is really the fundamentally is the primary consideration driving all the initiatives that we have launched over the last few years. We started with market reforms. We changed the trading hours. We changed the risk management. We have built a data center. We really changed a lot of our market infrastructure, so we're beginning to consult the market on additional improvement and the market reform packages. And then we started forming joint ventures with them. We launched renminbi readiness. We launched renminbi products. And then we worked on index futures and then started to work with them on the collaboration in the actual Connect and the linkage. So the -- we are really starting from -- to late 2014 and 2015 beyond, we're really entering into the next stage of our development, which started with Hong Kong-Shanghai -- Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect but is going to really rapidly moving into a much broader area of collaboration and connectivity so that market mutual access is no longer just one product here, another access product there. It is really part of a growing overall ecosystem that we're going to be building to make sure that Hong Kong once again is in the central place of the opening up of China. We're not trying to be the gateway of anything. We're trying to become part of that overall integration, the overall intersection of liquidities from post China and the rest of the world.\r\nIn this early stage where China only provide a product, which is equity, international provide the liquidity, which is the investors, in this era, we're going to see significant amount of product in China that is not just primary listing but they're secondary listings that are interested by international investors who want to go in. And we're going to see, more importantly, many, many of the international product that are needed and are desired by domestic liquidity and domestic capital investors. And those investors wanting to come out, international investors want to invest domestically, not only through Hong Kong, but more importantly, they are likely to want to go in, how do we completely reposition ourselves to make sure that we create that market, we benefit from that market and we lock ourselves into that market in the long term. So therefore, the opening up over time presents huge opportunities and huge challenges for Hong Kong as an international financial center.\r\nSo this is really the vision that we are moving into for mutual market era. Here, we're basically using the Connect model. It's not an accidental choice of one product. It's not just we got lucky. We negotiate something, we got a break. It is a very carefully designed program. It is a program that huge implications to what we're going to be doing in the future. This program essentially is making a linkage between -- a trading linkage between China and us. You all know how it works. Electronically, all the orders are out routed through, but most importantly, the clearing link is that it's a net settlement clearings, net settlement. All the international investors settle and clear here. Only the net is settled between Hong Kong Clear and China Clear. And the same is true, all the Chinese investors are trading and settling and clearing. So every single day, there only one investor on either side across the border to settle the net. Otherwise, everything is settled there, everything is settled over here. And the whole regime is regulated by the CSRC and the SFC together. So we have indeed created a mutual market, a market -- a common market, a market that we work together that -- where you have the 2 policemen regulating the market. You have the 2 trades. This is with Shanghai first managing the trading and then you have the clearing houses managing the clearing, and it's all settlement. Investors on both sides sitting in their homes, calling their own brokers, calling their own exchange, going through their own settlement and clearing and settle and regulated by their own exchange. So the only thing they don't have -- for the Chinese investors under this model, the only thing they don't have is whatever is the product that is still missing here. Otherwise, they have their regulator helping them. They have their broker-dealer motivated to help them, and they have the exchanges helping them. They have China Clear helping them. And they have us helping them. And they just literally do not have to go to London, go to New York, go to Australia. All they need to go is to pick up the phone and call and trade international. But the only constraint they have is whatever's in here. So today, we have Shanghai Hong Kong Connect. It's really equities, so we have Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect. And hopefully, very soon, we'll have Shenzhen Connect. And then the next thing we could do is that we could do equity derivatives. We could have our trade -- we could have our derivative future contract trade there, cash settled. We can have their contract coming here, trade cash settled. We could have a Connect program on derivatives. It's all possible.\r\nWe can also put commodities in there. We can have licensing regime. We can have connected regime, and we can have other connectivity or mutual access regime. We potentially could have international equity. International investors today -- international equity today are not included in the Connect program. There's no reason why it shouldn't be -- it shouldn't be connected sometime into the future. And if that connection happens, there's no reason to believe that international issuers may one day, whether you're already listed or not, can come here to this market and tap into this tremendous liquidity up there.\r\nWe could have fixed income. We could have currency. And we could have product all in the Hong Kong derivatives or we can have product that is coming from different areas and different market and different time zones. Or we can just continue to enrich this market and put more things in here. Obviously, when China investors becoming more sophisticated, they can go directly on their own. International investors who really wanted to trade directly into China, they don't have to do it here. They can directly go in. But whenever it is, there will always be a large segment of the public, whether it's up there or whether it's outside China, who may not necessarily want to directly go. As long as we have a model here that create this common market that you are able to rely on your own regulatory market infrastructures to trade the other's product, then this common market will become very important. So here, we will be working with all of them, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guilin, Guangzhou, China Clear and Shanghai Futures Exchange, we work with all of them. We're no longer competitors with them. We are partners with them. We are going -- we're working together to bring international product here for domestic investors. And we bring them here -- work with them to bring China product in here for international investors to go here. So that is really our business model going forward. We're no longer a single-trick pony that basically lists the China equities. We will become a comprehensive solution provider for everything that international market needs for China and for Chinese markets needs for the international market. And it is in this business model that we will be building out our equity, equity derivative commodity and the fixed income and currency business. This is also, in this model, we're going to build our LME futures strategic directions. LME will be an important part of our capabilities of providing product for the Chinese investors. LME will also be an important enabler for us to bring international liquidities into the common market to the extent that international market are interested in the domestic product we're going to put into the -- into this particular mutual market. \r\nSo what we talk about today is early stage. We're only here half of this, and we are in the process of building everything else. And we're really building an overall ecosystem where we are seeing the most important intersection of 2 largest global liquidities coming together finally, which is China and the rest of the world. \r\nIn China, we already talked about it. We have $5 trillion market cap in the equity market up here. We have about 3 -- we are about $26 trillion, so that's something that close to HKD 304 trillion [ph] market cap over here, but they have a banking market that is about USD 22 trillion. And that $22 trillion is going to come down to the $5 trillion at some point in the next 5 to 10 years. The 2 numbers should eventually converge, even if they don't grow externally, but I do -- so we think the domestic liquidity, the biggest challenge for China is to find product for that massive liquidity in the banks to find investment opportunity to diversify away from China banks. And we, our task, our mission in life is to provide this market, provide the product so that, that liquidity can finally move and migrate from China's banks to global deployment. And that's probably the last pool of capital in the world of that size that is yet to be globally deployed.\r\nSo our business model is fundamentally changing today and this is the beginning of that change. And our financial results today only start to show a glimpse of what is yet to come. Many of this are not going to immediately generate immediate revenue. Fortunately, none of this is so expensive for us to build. And whatever we have to spend over the next 3 to 5 years on our infrastructure, on our investment, are things that we have to do as exchange rather than that we have to do in order to get all of this. In order to get all of this, you need a lot of people, you need a lot of hours, you need a lot of OpEx, but do not need a lot of CapEx. But we will continue to invest in CapEx so that our broader capabilities are such that we are able to deliver this. So we will over the next 12 to 18 months, you will be hearing a lot of what we're going to be doing here. And not all the things we're going to be doing in isolation will be able to move the needle too much. And you will be hearing from me all the time, and I really meant it. It's beginning. It's early stage. It's yet to come. And we do believe that once you start to build and make this into a critical mass, the overall impact, the synergistic impact will come over time, and we will be a fundamentally different exchange. And with that particular model, we will then be moving beyond that and then potentially really create a global platform to make sure that we're truly connecting the global opportunities and the China opportunities, the 2 that are yet segregated but rapidly moving together. We want to make sure Hong Kong and Hong Kong Exchange is right in the middle, in the bullseye of that particular intersection. And that is our mission and that is our vision, and we are set out to succeed and to make it happen.\r\nAnd with that, I will open this up for questions. I have -- this is for the first time for the last few years, I have asked David Graham to sit downstairs because this is the commercial result announcement and he's the regulator. But I'm sure there are a lot of questions that you will be asking on the regulatory side of the exchange, on the listing divisions and other policy issues, and David will come up to answer those questions when those questions do appear. \r\nSo with that, without further ado, let me move on to the Q&A. Thank you very much.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nOkay. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us. We will do this as we normally do. For those who are familiar with us, we'll have a presentation first and then we'll have a question-and-answer time later. \r\nLet me just quickly say, for the Q&A, we will ask you all to wait for the microphones because we'll have a simultaneous interpretation. You may ask questions in English, Cantonese or Mandarin. Again, please do wait for the mic to come so the translator can hear what you're asking. And we also ask you just to help us keep track and know who's interested, who's coming, to give your name and organization when you put your question. \r\nI think without further ado, let me ask and invite Charles to come forward with the presentation.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Xiao Jia Li (Executives)】\nThank you very much for attending our earnings announcement today. I will very quickly make a broad introduction, and then Paul will walk you through our financials, and then I'll come back and touch on some of the strategic issues, but at the end mostly is really Q&As for all of you.\r\nOkay, this -- something is wrong here. Can you figure that out? Okay, great. I think -- this one doesn't work either. Okay. You got it? Perfect, yes. \r\nVery quickly, on the overall key achievement of 2014, both financial and otherwise. Our revenue and other income up 13%, mainly driven by increasing ADT and also related revenue increases. A record fund-raising year. This is really -- we're second globally in IPOs. I think this is even in the absence of some of the real big, large transactions. And we raised over HKD 900 million. This is a truly a record. \r\nSuccessfully launched the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect. Enhancement are now being implemented as we speak. \r\nLME commercialization in very, very solid and good progress. LME Clear launched, and with about 1/4 of operations this year. And overall ADT and LME hit a record high as well. \r\nIntroduced a 3 London Metal Exchange mini contracts in Asia. And this is really the first step for us to build out the commodity -- overall, the commodity win of LME.\r\nThis is really just a very quick breakdown on cash equity, derivative market and commodities. As you can see, volume has been growing quite solidly, both in the cash market and derivative market. I think if you look at the LME commodity product, the red, looks like this is the 700,000 vis-a-vis 676,000 is a very solid increase. The first quarter and actually the first couple of months still continued to saw very strong growth. You see the red, it seems to be dipping a little bit. That's actually is a little bit misleading. The number 2014 is the whole year number and the 696,000 is year-to-date, including a very big Chinese New Year holiday. Usually that's a slow time for LME. If you compare same period against the last period, LME is actually up more than close to 70%, 80% in terms of volume. \r\nSo very strong cash market ADT increase last year. Derivatives increased -- ADT increased 8%, commodity 4%, very solid year. And also, Paul will also walk you through on the financials, clearly indicating not only revenue is up, our revenue is up, outpacing ADT. And also partially, obviously as a result of a decrease in the trend of increase of the trend -- the growth of cost is smaller than -- significantly smaller than the growth of revenue. So as a result, we see very strong overall financial performance for 2014.\r\nAnd I will ask Paul to give you highlights of the year on financials first. Paul?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Paul Kennedy (Executives)】\nThank you, Charles. \r\nWell, the first thing is that I'm extremely pleased to stand here with such a great set of results. We nearly hit $10 billion, which would have been the first time. This is the highest income we've ever earned. Going back to 2007, we came close. But $9.8 billion, heading to $10 billion, and I'm sure we're going to beat that next year. \r\nAcross the whole slide here, I think it's a set of positive results. Trading volumes and revenue have obviously increased, but we had a particularly strong fourth quarter, really following the more positive sentiment in the Mainland. And also following the positive sentiment generated by the announcement of Stock Connect in November, we had a significant increase in ADT and activity generally. We had the 11 trading days where we hit over 100 billion a day, which we haven't seen for quite some time.\r\nSo revenue significantly up 13%. It's 28% higher than the fourth quarter of 2013. A number of factors have really driven growth this year. And our results whilst I believe they're good, I don't think they're controversial. They pretty much follow what we have seen in terms of activities of the group. \r\nWe launched LME Clear in 22nd of September, a really significant turning point for us. We've been building that system for a couple of years, and we've now had 1 quarter's revenue contribute to our earnings, and that's seen a clear jump. That added close to $200 million, $187 million of clearing income, trading income.\r\nWe also had a record capital raising year, an absolute record, $943 billion. We were second in the IPO market, but the secondary capital raising took us to a new record. And that's flowed through into our listing-related income and the income that's related to that, the IPO income and the brokerage income that's related to those new issues. That in total contributed around $100 million. \r\nWe've also seen an improvement in the interest rate environment this year. We've seen an average increase in the margin fees we've earned. And overall, looking at the Hong Kong investment of those funds, we've made about $180 million more. \r\nIn LME, there's been some investment income, but that tends to relate to gains on the holding of LCH, which is separately reported throughout our results. \r\nThe increase in ADT was felt across the piece. It's felt in the trading income, in the clearing income. And it has a spin off effect in other income like depository fees, especially in the fourth quarter. So our ADT was up by 11%, but overall, our trading and clearing fees were up by a higher percentage. \r\nDepository fees gone up by around $100 million and platform and infrastructure sales also by $100 million. And I think the importance of some of these numbers and the reason for giving you some of this breakdown is that the increase in our income this year, 45% of that increase came from nontrading activities, which I think is a particularly good result.\r\nAs we look at costs, operating expenses, these are under control. They've gone up by 7%. The number is slightly flatted by the fact that we had a recovery of amounts due from Lehman of $77 million this year. But net-net, considering that we were still building out LME Clear, LME is still going through a retooling process, and we're continuing to make investments. A 7% growth in operating costs in this year, I think, is a solid result. And as a consequence of revenue exceeding that, we see, flowing across the page significant increases in EBITDA and profit attributable to shareholders. And I think it's also important to note this year that the value given back to shareholders comes not just through the earnings per share, but by the fact that our share price has also gone up by 33%.\r\nThis is just a breakdown of the revenue and income as shown in our financial statements. I don't want to dwell on this too much. The trading fees obviously come primarily off the ADT. Just to note that the cash equity business was stronger than the 7%. The derivative business was rather flat. That's due to the mix. Even though we had record volumes in the derivative business in terms of the number of trades, the mix was on the lower fee side. Basically, the options grew faster than the futures. \r\nListing fees, I think it's obvious from the volumes. Clearing and settlement fees off the ADT, the higher volumes were also with that contribution of $187 million from LME Clear.\r\nScrip and depository fees gone up significantly this year, basically on increased activity in the market; market data fees, a modest increase; and other revenue and sundry income includes $50 million -- just under $50 million of income directly related to Stock Connect related to throttle sales that participants purchased for the purpose of equipping themselves for the launch of Stock Connect. Net investment income obviously up significantly, which I touched on just now.\r\nLooking at expenses. Staff costs up by 15%. On the face of it, quite significant, but when you consider that we have increased or we've doubled the headcount of LME over 2 years. We launched LME Clear, came on stream during the year. We had some increase in Hong Kong as a result of the initiatives we've been taking, not a surprising number. And in terms of our overall increase in costs, kept within the 7% total increase. \r\nWe've seen a reduction in IT and computer maintenance expenses that is helped by an initiative with LME to in-source exchanging, which is their external IT supplier. We've taken internally around 85 headcount. That is partly the reason for the staff costs increase, but we've seen a corresponding reduction in our IT costs. \r\nPremises expenses have gone down slightly. We've renegotiated the rent on some of our property. \r\nLegal and professional fees, we've seen an increase largely because of litigation. We spent $43 million on litigation last year as opposed to $15 million the year before. You may have seen the announcement this morning about some of the results of that U.S. litigation, so we're hoping that, that won't go any higher. \r\nOther operating expenses are a small reduction. \r\nIn depreciation, we've seen an increase of $140 million. This is a result of investments we've been making over the past few years, including LME Clear, but also including the Iran market data center and other projects we're launching here. \r\nSo some of the build outs from the capital expenditure we've been incurring in prior years are now coming through to launch. That included the last part of our data center in Tseung Kwan O, came on stream in the last quarter of 2013, and we'd seen that come through into depreciation. \r\nOur depreciation will continue to tick up, but we've peaked in terms of our CapEx expenditure at least for the time being.\r\nI like this slide. Everything's going in the right direction. As I mentioned, a really record quarter. It's not quite the highest quarter we've ever had, but definitely, all lines going in the right direction. And as you look at this graph, if you look at the period between the first quarter of 2013 and the current quarter, the revenue has increased by 24%. Our costs have increased by 17%. So over that period, our revenue growth has exceeded our cost growth, which is producing the greater returns we're now seeing. But I would also point out that we have just launched 2 initiatives from our U.K. purchase of LME, which will bring greater returns in the future. LME Clear fired up 1 quarter's income. It will be a full year next year. And LME has gone through a fee commercialization process, which kicks in or has kicked in from the 1st of January. So I think over that period where we've been investing, we still managed to grow our income and managed our costs. And hopefully, we'll now see the fruit of those initiatives coming through.\r\nPerformance by operating segment, no surprises. Cash equity, which had a strong year off the back of the ADT growth, we've seen an increase in the EBITDA margin. \r\nEquity and financial derivatives equally off ADT growth, a small increase in profitability. \r\nCommodities has seen a small decrease, that's not a surprise to us. We've seen some expenditure in here. We've seen some litigation costs. We've seen the launch of the Asia commodities initiatives in Hong Kong with the LME minis, so we've been spending and investing in this segment. That should improve next year as the commercialization of LME introduces higher fees. \r\nClearings had a very good year, partly off investments, partly off volumes, but also that 1 quarter of LME Clear's income that has kicked in. \r\nPlatform and infrastructure, relatively small numbers, but nevertheless, a pleasing improvement in the margin in this segment. \r\nOverall, the group has improved its EBITDA margin by a whole 2%. We've gone back to the rate we were at several years ago where we're operating an EBITDA margin of 70%.\r\nOne of the most significant things that has happened this year, as I mentioned at the beginning, is the commencement of the operations of LME Clear. And it's not just the income effect which is significant, it's also the impact on our balance sheet. \r\nAnd I show here the impact of LME Clear in 2 ways. First of all, the amount of collateral, the margin that they take from the market is very significant, nearly USD 10 billion. That's the $75 billion green box on this graph. Also, because of the nature of the derivative contracts at LME Clear, clears through its clearinghouse, they are not able to net all of the contracts against each other for the purpose of accounting. Their contracts settle gross, the contracts we deal with here settle net. The difference in accounting treatment has resulted in HKD 60 billion of derivative contracts being recorded on either side of our balance sheet. There is no net effect on our balance sheet. They're recorded on either side, assets and liabilities. Interestingly, just to put it in perspective, the gross value of the derivative contracts cleared by LME at the end of December was HKD 1.2 trillion. So the balances have been netted down to $60 billion, but nevertheless, that difference in accounting treatment has resulted in our balance sheet going from an $86 billion asset balance sheet to a $252 billion asset balance sheet.\r\nI'll now hand back to Charles. And at the end, we'll be happy to take questions.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Xiao Jia Li (Executives)】\nThank you, Paul. \r\nWhat I will do before we open up for questions is that we start to see a real strong set of result and we are on the verge of breaking into, for the first time, $10 billion revenue. We're very excited about it. We're absolutely certain, next year, we will get there, and it's a really a matter of still how much more than the $10 billion magic number on the revenue side. \r\nBut I wanted to spend a few minutes, particularly with our analysts, because I did spend quite a bit of time with our media friends about a month ago about our strategy and outlook. I wanted to basically put our business, and particularly, this set of revenues in the perspective of the past and present and where we are going from here and why we think -- where we should be looking at the changes in the dynamics of our various part of our business. \r\nI think we -- I wanted to talk about the overall full period of our history very quickly and then put into the perspective as to where -- to what -- why we're doing many of the things we're doing today. \r\nI think that if you think about the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong market in general, it's really a 4 big areas -- 4 big eras. The IPO era back started in the 1993 to about 20-some years. From a $3 trillion market, we become a $26 trillion market today. In this period, in that first period, we essentially are doing just one thing. We basically bring China equity into Hong Kong. We raised equity for Chinese enterprises, and then they give us the paper. We trade that paper to secondary market, and we become a very strong international market by participation from international investors in that initial equity raising by China Inc. and then we trade. So today, our market cap up 60% the Chinese companies and 70% ADTs are Chinese companies. That's really our business, our market, our era, first era in our development. And one key distinction of that period vis-a-vis today is a complete segregation of the 2 markets.\r\nThen we start to see a significant growth of the domestic market, partially financed by us, obviously, the entire industry growth, China's GDP growth and international funds flow into Mainland from IPO process -- proceeds, FDIs and many other things that really drive domestic growth. But meanwhile, a very important part of the second stage is that domestic capital market become very, very big and growing much faster. And it started about the same time with us, but is really taking off. The domestic equity market, for example, today, is already about the second largest in size, and in terms of its daily trading volumes, as you know, in the last few months, it has actually reached RMB 1 trillion for a couple of days. And the commodity market also is also becoming extremely strong. The 3 commodity market today, almost all of them have very strong contract, at least in terms of number of contract. Whether those commodity exchanges truly service China's underlying economic needs is a different story, but in terms of the actual capital market, the commodity capital market, financial market, the derivative market in particular, have become extremely strong. And in terms of number of contracts traded there, many of the contract, they traded #1 in the world. CFFEX, the CSI 300 for example, is really the biggest traded derivative contracts in the world. And the 3 domestic commodity exchanges, if you put all of their trading volumes together, they are larger than -- they're 3x of CME, they're 3x of LME and ICE. And even individually, they really are 1 or 2 or #2, #1, #2, #3 globally. \r\nSo the second growth era in the last -- in between 2001 and 2010 has really created a domestic capital market that we have to think long and hard what does it mean to us in Hong Kong? What does it mean for our existing business in equity? What does it mean for the business that we don't yet already have, which is fixed income and currency and commodities? \r\nAnd also in this second stage of growth, China start to really begin to experiment the opening through the launch of QFIIs and QDIIs.\r\nAnd now we really in the last 5 years, we start to see a dramatic acceleration, not only of the growth of the market in China but is really the opening up of the domestic market, the internationalization of the renminbi, the development of the Free Trade Zone in Shanghai and now potentially in the number of other areas. And the international investors are really invite -- created the situations for international investors to come in and for their investors to go out. The QFIIs are being considered to be increased and the QDIIs are considered to be increased. So the domestic investors are eagerly trying to begin to prepare to invest beyond China, and the international investors are giving more and more access to go into China. But the most important and the most fastest growth is really coming in the opening up of the renminbi. I think we will see in the coming weeks and months significant acceleration in announcing new changes in internationalization of renminbi. It will becoming a lot easier to convert renminbi, to change renminbi. Today, we have China Clear through the Connect program have to come to Hong Kong to exchange into renminbi offshore. We could see that change over not too far into the future, that potentially, they could change that in onshore into renminbi. And the offshore broker-dealers, offshore -- and the CCASS and many other institutions could be allowed to potentially go up and onshore exchange into renminbi at some time in the future months to come.\r\nSo this accelerated growth, accelerated opening of China's market is really giving us tremendous amount of pressure and tremendous amount of challenge as to how we need to respond. Because clearly, our business model here, which is really raising capital for them, is no longer going to serve Hong Kong in the new era where they need international investors to go in, and they want their investors to go out. And Hong Kong, what exactly is the role that we are going to play is really the fundamentally is the primary consideration driving all the initiatives that we have launched over the last few years. We started with market reforms. We changed the trading hours. We changed the risk management. We have built a data center. We really changed a lot of our market infrastructure, so we're beginning to consult the market on additional improvement and the market reform packages. And then we started forming joint ventures with them. We launched renminbi readiness. We launched renminbi products. And then we worked on index futures and then started to work with them on the collaboration in the actual Connect and the linkage. So the -- we are really starting from -- to late 2014 and 2015 beyond, we're really entering into the next stage of our development, which started with Hong Kong-Shanghai -- Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect but is going to really rapidly moving into a much broader area of collaboration and connectivity so that market mutual access is no longer just one product here, another access product there. It is really part of a growing overall ecosystem that we're going to be building to make sure that Hong Kong once again is in the central place of the opening up of China. We're not trying to be the gateway of anything. We're trying to become part of that overall integration, the overall intersection of liquidities from post China and the rest of the world.\r\nIn this early stage where China only provide a product, which is equity, international provide the liquidity, which is the investors, in this era, we're going to see significant amount of product in China that is not just primary listing but they're secondary listings that are interested by international investors who want to go in. And we're going to see, more importantly, many, many of the international product that are needed and are desired by domestic liquidity and domestic capital investors. And those investors wanting to come out, international investors want to invest domestically, not only through Hong Kong, but more importantly, they are likely to want to go in, how do we completely reposition ourselves to make sure that we create that market, we benefit from that market and we lock ourselves into that market in the long term. So therefore, the opening up over time presents huge opportunities and huge challenges for Hong Kong as an international financial center.\r\nSo this is really the vision that we are moving into for mutual market era. Here, we're basically using the Connect model. It's not an accidental choice of one product. It's not just we got lucky. We negotiate something, we got a break. It is a very carefully designed program. It is a program that huge implications to what we're going to be doing in the future. This program essentially is making a linkage between -- a trading linkage between China and us. You all know how it works. Electronically, all the orders are out routed through, but most importantly, the clearing link is that it's a net settlement clearings, net settlement. All the international investors settle and clear here. Only the net is settled between Hong Kong Clear and China Clear. And the same is true, all the Chinese investors are trading and settling and clearing. So every single day, there only one investor on either side across the border to settle the net. Otherwise, everything is settled there, everything is settled over here. And the whole regime is regulated by the CSRC and the SFC together. So we have indeed created a mutual market, a market -- a common market, a market that we work together that -- where you have the 2 policemen regulating the market. You have the 2 trades. This is with Shanghai first managing the trading and then you have the clearing houses managing the clearing, and it's all settlement. Investors on both sides sitting in their homes, calling their own brokers, calling their own exchange, going through their own settlement and clearing and settle and regulated by their own exchange. So the only thing they don't have -- for the Chinese investors under this model, the only thing they don't have is whatever is the product that is still missing here. Otherwise, they have their regulator helping them. They have their broker-dealer motivated to help them, and they have the exchanges helping them. They have China Clear helping them. And they have us helping them. And they just literally do not have to go to London, go to New York, go to Australia. All they need to go is to pick up the phone and call and trade international. But the only constraint they have is whatever's in here. So today, we have Shanghai Hong Kong Connect. It's really equities, so we have Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect. And hopefully, very soon, we'll have Shenzhen Connect. And then the next thing we could do is that we could do equity derivatives. We could have our trade -- we could have our derivative future contract trade there, cash settled. We can have their contract coming here, trade cash settled. We could have a Connect program on derivatives. It's all possible.\r\nWe can also put commodities in there. We can have licensing regime. We can have connected regime, and we can have other connectivity or mutual access regime. We potentially could have international equity. International investors today -- international equity today are not included in the Connect program. There's no reason why it shouldn't be -- it shouldn't be connected sometime into the future. And if that connection happens, there's no reason to believe that international issuers may one day, whether you're already listed or not, can come here to this market and tap into this tremendous liquidity up there.\r\nWe could have fixed income. We could have currency. And we could have product all in the Hong Kong derivatives or we can have product that is coming from different areas and different market and different time zones. Or we can just continue to enrich this market and put more things in here. Obviously, when China investors becoming more sophisticated, they can go directly on their own. International investors who really wanted to trade directly into China, they don't have to do it here. They can directly go in. But whenever it is, there will always be a large segment of the public, whether it's up there or whether it's outside China, who may not necessarily want to directly go. As long as we have a model here that create this common market that you are able to rely on your own regulatory market infrastructures to trade the other's product, then this common market will become very important. So here, we will be working with all of them, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guilin, Guangzhou, China Clear and Shanghai Futures Exchange, we work with all of them. We're no longer competitors with them. We are partners with them. We are going -- we're working together to bring international product here for domestic investors. And we bring them here -- work with them to bring China product in here for international investors to go here. So that is really our business model going forward. We're no longer a single-trick pony that basically lists the China equities. We will become a comprehensive solution provider for everything that international market needs for China and for Chinese markets needs for the international market. And it is in this business model that we will be building out our equity, equity derivative commodity and the fixed income and currency business. This is also, in this model, we're going to build our LME futures strategic directions. LME will be an important part of our capabilities of providing product for the Chinese investors. LME will also be an important enabler for us to bring international liquidities into the common market to the extent that international market are interested in the domestic product we're going to put into the -- into this particular mutual market. \r\nSo what we talk about today is early stage. We're only here half of this, and we are in the process of building everything else. And we're really building an overall ecosystem where we are seeing the most important intersection of 2 largest global liquidities coming together finally, which is China and the rest of the world. \r\nIn China, we already talked about it. We have $5 trillion market cap in the equity market up here. We have about 3 -- we are about $26 trillion, so that's something that close to HKD 304 trillion [ph] market cap over here, but they have a banking market that is about USD 22 trillion. And that $22 trillion is going to come down to the $5 trillion at some point in the next 5 to 10 years. The 2 numbers should eventually converge, even if they don't grow externally, but I do -- so we think the domestic liquidity, the biggest challenge for China is to find product for that massive liquidity in the banks to find investment opportunity to diversify away from China banks. And we, our task, our mission in life is to provide this market, provide the product so that, that liquidity can finally move and migrate from China's banks to global deployment. And that's probably the last pool of capital in the world of that size that is yet to be globally deployed.\r\nSo our business model is fundamentally changing today and this is the beginning of that change. And our financial results today only start to show a glimpse of what is yet to come. Many of this are not going to immediately generate immediate revenue. Fortunately, none of this is so expensive for us to build. And whatever we have to spend over the next 3 to 5 years on our infrastructure, on our investment, are things that we have to do as exchange rather than that we have to do in order to get all of this. In order to get all of this, you need a lot of people, you need a lot of hours, you need a lot of OpEx, but do not need a lot of CapEx. But we will continue to invest in CapEx so that our broader capabilities are such that we are able to deliver this. So we will over the next 12 to 18 months, you will be hearing a lot of what we're going to be doing here. And not all the things we're going to be doing in isolation will be able to move the needle too much. And you will be hearing from me all the time, and I really meant it. It's beginning. It's early stage. It's yet to come. And we do believe that once you start to build and make this into a critical mass, the overall impact, the synergistic impact will come over time, and we will be a fundamentally different exchange. And with that particular model, we will then be moving beyond that and then potentially really create a global platform to make sure that we're truly connecting the global opportunities and the China opportunities, the 2 that are yet segregated but rapidly moving together. We want to make sure Hong Kong and Hong Kong Exchange is right in the middle, in the bullseye of that particular intersection. And that is our mission and that is our vision, and we are set out to succeed and to make it happen.\r\nAnd with that, I will open this up for questions. I have -- this is for the first time for the last few years, I have asked David Graham to sit downstairs because this is the commercial result announcement and he's the regulator. But I'm sure there are a lot of questions that you will be asking on the regulatory side of the exchange, on the listing divisions and other policy issues, and David will come up to answer those questions when those questions do appear. \r\nSo with that, without further ado, let me move on to the Q&A. Thank you very much.",
      "transcript_text3": "Thank you Charles, and thank you, Paul. We normally start with the analysts. I think I saw Mr. Pun's hand up. We can start this side. York Pun?\n\n---\n\nI think this is actually the first time for us to get together since the official launch of Stock Connect, so congratulations again. I do have 3 questions. York Pun from HSBC. The first 2 are financial related, the last one is strategy. The Stock Connect has bring in HKD 68 million revenue in 2014. Can you give us more color how much of it comes from clearing and trading? How much of it might be from the, say, one-off photo [ph] sales? And then LME, I think unlike in last year, this year, you haven't provided specific discussion on LME's performance. But I think we're quite interested to know what's the profit growth of LME in 2014? And with the fee commercialization, how this profitability has further trended year to date? I think, Charles, the last question is for you. In the past, you mentioned that China is on the way to become a net capital exporter, and Hong Kong is on the way to benefit. I think in the recent financial picture, our Financial Secretary also asked Hong Kong to capture the opportunity from this and especially the [indiscernible] policy. So as a leading financial organization in Hong Kong, how do you position for this?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Paul, why don't you answer the first 2 questions. But before Paul does, I think it's important to look at the Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect revenue carefully because this is really, as I said, is ecosystem. The $68 million include one-time items and a -- but the going -- but the regular ongoing piece is smaller than that, and Paul is going to go into some granular detail. But the most important thing to remember is that the Connect revenue that we're booking here are purely directly the revenue-sharing part of it. But Connect is bringing tremendous amount of changes in our ADT, and in particular, not only the level of ADT, but the mix of the ADT. So if you want to think about Connect, think about Connect as a physical connection first. It's the physical -- the physics are changing because things are -- water are flowing into different directions, are changing. But the more important, which is not completely visible in our financial reflections going forward, is the chemical change. The chemical change, the 2 market are becoming very different. The different markets are coming together. DNAs are changing, and they're transforming a nice step. And we will start to see the ADT and then the activeness of the trading becoming very, very different. And LME, I think, Paul can also give, but the LME result, I think going forward, I don't know how much Paul can tell you, this last year, LME very strong. But LME Clear only have 1 quarter’s of operation but booked a full quarter's of cost. So this coming year, we will see LME contribution becoming very significant. Our overall anticipation is that LME will become 20% of our business -- more than 20% of our business, could easily be more than 20% of our business, our revenue. And I think the margin is going to be approaching to 60 or upper mid-60s sort of a margin range. Paul? And I'll answer the last question later.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Charles and York. To touch on Stock Connect, it's very early days to be talking about specific direct income kind of Stock Connect. And as Charles said, a lot of the financial impact now is from the, if you like, the halo effect that's been created. If you look at the fourth quarter ADT at over 80 billion, which was a significant jump from the previous quarter, you have to question, I think, and we certainly believe that part of that is due to the Stock Connect effect, if you like. In terms of the actual numbers, we've disclosed the Stock Connect direct income of $68 million. $48 million of that was one-off, is due to the purchase of equipment throttles which participants have purchased to enter the market. At the moment, you all know the volumes, 4 billion to 5 billion of northbound, 1 billion southbound. The southbound is included in our general ADT numbers, but the northbound, being Asia purchases, isn't. So that's pure incremental. And obviously, we like to see these numbers grow. But I think it really is early days to try and forecast forward. And not that I could anyway, but to forecast forward at this stage, I think, is premature, but that's the actual breakdown to date. To talk about LME, again without giving specific numbers, we've previously given guidance based on the income that LCH have disclosed. And essentially, we've taken over that income based on the same clearing fee, which indicates fees somewhere in the region of USD 90 million for LME Clear. And we've also previously said we would expect the margin on that to be in the mid-60s, possibly a touch higher. So a good healthy margin approaching what we earned at the group level. On the LME side, we publicly said that the average trading fee has gone up by 31%. That -- I'm sorry, the average transaction fee has gone up by 31%. That includes the clearing fee. So the trading fee has gone up obviously by proportionately more. As to the volume or the income next year, I think the best guidance I can give you is that we would expect the LME Group to account for a little north of 20% of our group results next year. So it's a significant jump from where it is at the moment. And hopefully, that will give you a flavor of the significant increase we would see, hope to see coming through from LME and LME Clear next year.\n\n---\n\nOn your third question is really what we're going to have -- what do we need to do, Hong Kong needs to do, in order to really be more competitive and to be relevant. I think we are faced with huge challenges because the last 20 years, we actually didn't have to do too much because we represent capital. We have the capital, China need the capital. They need to fit themselves into our rules, into our practices, need to accommodate our practices in order to make it happen. By sheer fact that we have the capital, we have a great, sound market infrastructure and legal structure that international investor trusts, and therefore, the Chinese issuers have to come. But they're limited in numbers because, today, we have about 1,600 company listed, 60 -- and maybe just over 1,000 companies, you only need to deal with 1,000 companies for them to make a decision to list only one's [ph] decision and then all the trading is happening here. So Hong Kong Inc., Hong Kong does not have to do a whole lot, and we have been very successful the last -- which is our system, our market is more sophisticated and they don't. Today, they're catching up. So they no longer have the situations where they have to go through Hong Kong. There are many ways now. Their capital need a home, and Hong Kong is not necessarily the only destination. And their issuers, the companies are able to access domestic capital. In many ways, the domestic capital is more attractive than in Hong Kong market because of the valuation gap, because of the massive liquidity there. So therefore, today, in order for us to do what we're talking about here, we need to really change fast. We need to make sure that the differences we have with their market is continued to be maintained. We used to be, let's say, 50% better, that's why people come or international investors like us. Today, that may already being shrinked to 20%, 30%. We need to continue to move ahead. But more importantly, we really are dealing with investors now. We start to deal with Chinese and international investors on large scales. The Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect clearly indicated the tremendous amount of consultation we have to have to market, because the market needs to tell us whether Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect works, whether people actually wants to trade. One of the things you have to do in order for them to feel comfortable to trade, you actually have to do a lot of work rather than just sit and that the market will be here. We have to sell. We have to make the channel works. We have to continue to eliminate the differences. On the other hand, we have to also figure out what the domestic markets constraints are, what their desires are, what is their aspiration, how the domestic investors want to trade. We have to really -- we -- out of -- sort of start to find our stakeholders are much more numerous, are much more broad, and we now actually have to be a lot more accommodating. So in order for us to do all of this, we need to understand them better, we need to change some of the things, we need to do things we have never done before. We need to purchase and acquire capabilities that we don't have before. So we have a huge advantage in terms of being trusted by China, being trusted by international investors' community. But we have to have all the tools and we have to have all the solutions in order to deliver what is needed. So it's going to be difficult and it's not going to be easy. But the Connect is launched, and we lock ourselves into a good pattern of work and we just have to keep on delivering in time. We keep -- have to make sure that for those players who represent China's investors and for many of the investors that we continue to be the best, easiest market for them to access because, today, they have choices. And I would be surprised if domestic changes, over the coming weeks and months, start to announce international alliances, international connectivity programs. They are doing it now, I know for a fact, and they will be announcing them. We just need to make sure that we are constantly ahead of the pack. We are constant delivering a solution that better fit, and we are delivering a solution that nobody else can deliver, and that's how we are able to succeed.\n\n---\n\nAny questions on the -- maybe Eric in the front row?\n\n---\n\nEric from the Hong Kong Economic Times. Charles, you just talked about you're expecting a big step forward in the months to come in the international of renminbi. And actually -- or could you elaborate a bit on what are you expecting actually? And shall that be the connectability of renminbi or in what way -- and in what way that will affect the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect?\n\n---\n\nYes. I don't -- I'm not part of the China's regulatory establishment. I do -- I have a lot of discussions with them. It is my personal belief, as I do not represent anybody making any announcement that, that pace will accelerate in terms of they're going to make it very easy for people to exchange. They're going to make it very easy for people to swap renminbi into U.S. dollar -- into Hong Kong dollars and vice versa, and that they are very -- the strong differentiation, all the barriers between CNH and CNY, which is basically offshore renminbi and onshore renminbi, I think that wall and that, that differentiation or segregation is going to become a lot blurrier. And then I think because of the very healthy changes in renminbi exchange rate on both side of the range and then for the last year, China has not really actively intervened in the exchange rate market. That just indicated a strong -- that has given China Inc., I believe, a higher -- much higher level of confidence that this is something that they can afford to create a much greater regime for renminbi to be exchanged more readily and more freely and without artificial barriers onshore and offshore. Exactly how fast they will move it and how easy they will move it, I don't really know. But I do expect that sometime later this year, we will see significant changes for the better. Any movement, any change that is going to make it easier for people to change currencies and to hold, and exchange, and trade and return back to their original currency, any efforts to do that is going to make Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect works. Obviously, the current model works a particular way. If they changed, we may want to change. If we do change, there might be some small inconvenience that we have to make adjustment on. But overall, those changes are better for the capital flows. So that all the artificial barriers that is creating restrictive, creating friction -- increasing friction cost of those change is going to dramatically coming down and that's the direction. I know you wanted something more specific, and I probably shouldn't really comment on something that I don't know or whether or not it will become official policy. So let's wait for them to announce, if they're going to go announce it.\n\n---\n\nGet back maybe to the analyst side, are there other analyst's questions on my left?\n\n---\n\nI saw some friend in the media laughing. Some of them told me that every time I speak, they like it, until later on when they started to write the article, they said, \"The guy said a lot of things interesting, but we couldn't write anything because he didn't say anything much at all.\" So maybe I just did that. Sorry about it.\n\n---\n\nOkay. We're also taking some questions from the Internet. We have -- we're live on -- be able to be watched by media and told we have one question from Shanghai for Charles asking why do you think there's been no short-selling and there was no short-selling in the first couple of days under Stock Connect's northbound trading?\n\n---\n\nI actually don't know, but I'm sure that the fact that it's not easy to borrow has something to do with it. And so this is one of the -- again, this is one of the little access road. We build the bridge, which is the Connect, there are many access road we're going to built to make overall the traffic move it easier. Short-selling is one more access road that will help, and we build it. It's open for traffic now, and we haven't seen any cars yet. And I'm not worried about it. It's very important to get that open. So people need to understand why this is the case. In China, there's a very significant regulatory structure in place on short-selling. The domestic market infrastructure is so transparent and so easy to enforce the rules that they are able to put many of the regulatory requirements of short-selling into the software, into the see-through systems in China. So therefore, they are able to save 25% control, and they can control it. Obviously, when short-selling is permitted in Hong Kong, the initial discussion with Shanghai is that, why don't you replicate the domestic type of see-through system in Hong Kong then you can do as much short-selling as the domestic investors. We obviously didn't want to do that because our system works very differently. So as part of the compromise, we agreed, you don't make us change, but you can control the pipe first. And then -- but towards the end, we did make some changes, particularly about the -- and then who is eligible to lend. Right now, we included only the brokers and the broker affiliates, and many of the custodian banks and others are not yet part of the program. I think that's one of the reasons in the international market that people who have the shares, if they're not able to lend, and then obviously, there are not a lot of shares to borrow from. So I think -- and then -- but we're not concerned. The first thing we -- the most important is that it launched. The traffic, the road is open. And then we will begin to think about and how to work with the traffic, and that we will also show Shanghai and Shenzhen the domestic regulators how our market works. If they don't see any short-selling, they will say, \"Oh, nothing to worry about it. Maybe we can allow you to make this change, maybe we can allow the pipe to go up a little bit.\" So this is not necessarily a bad thing. And I think if the short-selling, we started the first day, a massive amount of short-selling, that, obviously, will make it difficult. Again, I didn't say much.\n\n---\n\nOkay, I think there's a question here in the center, the lady in white with the green jacket.\n\n---\n\n[Chinese] An analyst already asked about Shanghai Connect and its contribution to your profitability. Can you give your answer again in Chinese? The second question is, today, [indiscernible] Li said that he was going to be committed now to expediting the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect. And last time, when [indiscernible] Li talked about Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect, very soon afterwards, it was launched. And what do you think is the right time for Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect? And today, a Risk Committee is being set up by the Hong Kong Exchange. I'd like to know what exactly is it for. And also, if there is time, because your contract is going to be up in October...\n\n---\n\nI think each of you is allowed only 3 questions at a time.\n\n---\n\nNow after the Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect has been launched and the direct and one-off contribution to our profitability, of course, is considerable. And this is because the players will have to participate in the market immediately. And after they have completed the trading, they have to pay a fee and so and so forth. And my colleagues, just now, has already mentioned this. And the other part of the income is in direct, the profit sharing between Shanghai Exchange and Hong Kong Exchange. And as long as the volume keeps building, then the profit would keep building. It's been around only for 1.5 months. And every day, it is ongoing. And the profit is being shared every day between the 2 exchanges. And thirdly, now because of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect, because of the launch of this mechanism, the exchange in Shanghai as well as exchange in Hong Kong have both benefited in terms of the increase in volume. And that really is the largest part of contribution to our profitability, but it's difficult to quantify this particular segment. And then the most important contribution is [indiscernible] contribution. Now because of Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect, the 2 volumes of trading actually are now merged and linked together. And one exchange actually is very corporatized and the other exchange is very individualized, and so each has its own chemistry. But because of the Connect, now both exchanges are benefiting in the sense that they have become more disciplined and they have benefited from getting linked up with each other. And so in terms of circulation and in terms of volume and the building up of trading, there has been chemical benefits to both exchanges. And then Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect, of course, it's only a matter of time. It's no longer of any news value. And [indiscernible] Li asked about -- what's being asked about the timing for Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect, and he said that it will be launched sometime, and so that's exactly what he mean. I think for the IT system to become ready, I think it's going to take a few more months. And Chairman Shing Kwong [ph] has already mentioned that it's likely that announcement will be made in the first half of this year. And so I think this is already in the public domain, it really does not need me to announce. As for Risk Management committee, under the SFO, there is a provision for the setting up of the Risk Management Committee comprising representatives from various quarters of society as well as SFC, as well as Hong Kong Monetary Authority and so on and so forth. And Risk Management Committee should be the principal Risk Management Committee for Hong Kong Exchange. Because Hong Kong Stock Exchange work in the past, it used to be more straightforward. And so the Risk Management Committee used to be more concerned with the overall discipline of the market and the overall risk management of the market. But during the past 5 years, Hong Kong Stock Exchange has moved principally towards internationalization and towards derivatives and also of getting merged with other exchanges. And that is why the risk requirement has become far in exceedance of the original ambit of the Risk Management Committee, and that is why the Hong Kong Stock Exchange needs its own dedicated Risk Management Committee to look at Hong Kong Stock Exchange's new portfolio and also what kind of impact did we have on the overall financial market of Hong Kong and also how such risk can be best managed. Now because of hackers impact on the Internet, Hong Kong Stock Exchange may face a certain Internet race. And this is something that is under the ambit of Hong Kong Stock Exchange's in-house committee and it is answerable to the board.\n\n---\n\nThe questions from the floor, maybe an analyst side again, if not -- okay, this lady here, third row in the tan jacket.\n\n---\n\nI'm [indiscernible] from Maybank Kim Eng. You mentioned earlier that you know for a fact that speaking to other exchanges for connection and interlink outside of Hong Kong, which -- who is your biggest competitor? Will they be looking for something out in Europe, a different time zone? Or are we looking at Asian competitors, specifically Singapore, because there's already news about it? So do you worry about that? The second question I have is in that box, the blue box. So we know the equity side, what is the next box you think that you will focus on because Shenzhen Connect is a matter of time? Is it commodities, fixed income, currency? And timing maybe, any indication? I think that will be it.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I think I'm not worried about if they want to talk to everybody else. In fact, I feel very encouraged they do because the fact they're able to talk to other exchanges is a clear milestone. If they actually announce anything, it's a milestone of the mindset change in that market opening. And so if they are able to actually open up something with somebody else, it will be tremendous. Just think about it. We are really -- I think in the old days, in the last 20 years, this IPO regime that we have, they all come here. We are -- Hong Kong is becoming very comfortable and is almost feeling very entitled to some sort of exclusive deal with China, that you have to go through us, and we are here. And you shouldn't really be dealing with anybody else, otherwise, you become a competitor. I actually do not think of -- in those terms at all because we're really talking about, let's say, China does not grow, we are talking about USD 22 trillion have to move in somewhere over the next 5 to 10 years. Their equity market is going to double or even triple over the next 10 years. The opportunity is so much so that we want everybody to provide market, product and opportunities for them. We want those exchanges to really go around the world to see whether they can get more activities. Because the more activities they create, the more dynamic China become, the more comfortable the Chinese leadership becomes in terms of line opening. Because if we continued to deliver all of the things we're doing here, we are always going to be taking a huge chunk, if not the largest chunk of this business. And the more they do on the fringe, the better for the core. So I actually do not consider that to be a competitor. So they could be talking to some European exchanges. They could be talking to Singapore or Tokyo. They could even be talking to some U.S. exchanges. I will be very surprised if in the next 12 months, we do not see 2 or 3 major announcements, and so much so and so much the better. And also, every time they talk to somebody else, they're going to come back and feel what a wonderful partner Hong Kong Stock Exchange is. Second question is, I apologize, I'm getting...\n\n---\n\nThe next Connect, the next Connect.\n\n---\n\nOh, right. In terms of timing, well, timing is this, this, this, this is timing. But we are here. We're halfway here. So this year, we are going to complete this. We probably -- this 2, probably will happen sometime. We will have something that we can tell you in greater and more granular details. Hopefully, sometime second half of this year. And this is probably, again, while speculation that we will begin to think about it and talk about it sometime, let's say, this time next year. And fixed income and the currency, we already have currency. But these 2 are very -- we could become -- we already have a lot of discussions. We're going to have FICC conference in June. But I think this 2, over longer period of time, are very big, but it takes some initial efforts trying to connect it. It's not about regulatory policy or -- it's talking about find the right way of doing it because this is all about debt market and it's about the rates market. And in this market, we need to find our role between China, international, between the banks and the brokers, between the issuers and the investors. And we need to find a way where we can make our money and we can make it big successful. At the same time, we are very important to all the key players. OTC Clear could become a very part of this, but this is probably -- so you have to really guess this is today, this is like -- if we, in the morning, we finish up, this will be in the afternoon or tomorrow morning, and this is going to be the day after tomorrow. Figuratively, again, I didn't say much.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Other questions on the floor? We're getting down to the last few. So if you have a question, please do raise your hand. Maybe Peter in the center here. And then we go -- after Peter, I see Ashley in the back. So Peter and then Ashley.\n\n---\n\nI tried to keep the answers short so that we have more questions, sorry.\n\n---\n\nI'll ask you a short question as well. Just on the -- I'm wondering about the investment involved in basically what you're talking about here and particularly, kind of what you -- what sort of orders of magnitude you're talking about. And also I'm just curious about how that might be financed because when I look at your balance sheet, you basically got no debt at all, and -- but you're also paying out 90% of your earnings as dividends. So how do you think about the investment, the balance sheet and the dividend?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think all these business activities do not require us massive amount of money. Let's say, the Shenzhen, Shanghai, we're really talking about HKD 100 million, HKD 200 million type of OpEx, but this is a whole lot of people, a lot of overtime, IT, infrastructure, people. But we really -- even on -- even -- I think it's -- very similarly, we are not really talking about a significant amount of massive CapEx. We are not building anything. But because of we're doing all of these things as a new business and we cannot really continue to relying on our existing infrastructure, existing people, existing resources to keep on taxing the original and the current core business infrastructure. So over time, we have to build. We maybe have to build a secondary data center at some point. We have to build on the next trading platform, which is going to cost, let's say, HKD 300 million, HKD 400 million. And we may have to do something on our clearing infrastructure in the next 3 years. So we could see another wave of CapEx at some point, but we -- those are the money that we have to spend in order to keep our -- but those are other things that, essentially, you have to do, otherwise, you won't be able to achieve your strategic investments. So we can time it reasonably easily. We have done a 3-, 4-year, 5-year forecast, and Paul has done that, and I don't really think -- I think we're in good shape. But whether or not ultimately, at some point, we're going to review our dividend, scrip dividend policy, whether or not we're going to, at some point, review our dividend policy, this is all items and our future agenda that we will discuss. We're not ruling them off, but we're not making any decisions. We're not giving the market any indication or guidance on that particular direction.\n\n---\n\nHave you seen Ashley? Get in the back, I think in the backroom. Maybe Vivian, closer to you. Thanks.\n\n---\n\nTwo quick questions on risk. I'm Ashley from the International Financial Law Review. First, how do you plan to deal with overlap between the Risk Management Committee and the Risk Committee? And secondly, given the increase of importance in the clearing business, I guess, domestically, how are you going to deal with the Hong Kong Exchange's role in relation to the domestic bank resolution consultation from the HKMA, as well as broader global initiatives in relation to financial markets infrastructure?\n\n---\n\nOkay, I will answer the first question between -- Paul, you want to talk about this consultation issues. I think the Risk Committee, the policy -- the stature in Risk Committee is more talking about Hong Kong market risk macro and also how Hong Kong Exchange in the context of that is going to react as managing its policies, managing its procedures. But the broad Risk Management Committee is much more focused on Hong Kong exchange itself. And our risk is really the first -- the biggest area of risk that we discuss is our CCP risk, Central Counterparty risk, because we're running a clearinghouse. And it's really about policy, about the margins, about collaterals, about the waterfalls, about our various capital efficiency, liquidity issues of our CCP. We also a talked ERM, our Enterprise Risk Management, which is about access, hyper security, and Internet security and others. So I think the 2 committees will have some overlapping in terms of overall market risk and -- but it would really not be -- broadly speaking, they're very, very different. But in terms of our -- the connectivity with China that is expose -- exposing China or exposing us to risks potentially from the other side of the market. I think, as you can see in the Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect, and we're going to essentially replicate that in all the other access product or access programs, essentially, is segregated. China Clear, for example, will provide separate margins, and they will not be responsible for Hong Kong resolution or Hong Kong default. And conversely, Hong Kong broker-dealers will not be responsible should China Clear default. And that the guarantee funds of Hong Kong is not going to be used to pay for a potential default of China Clear and that they actually do not. They're actually more worried about whether we're using their money to pay some of our brokers default, and then -- but then we charge substantial margins with China Clear and at a level significantly higher than what we are charging in Hong Kong. So because they have a much tightened and a more aggressive risk management measures that we are replicating and we are reciprocating with them. So I think that's really how that is done. But there, it's -- you're almost dealing with entity that have a sovereign risk profile. In terms of the consultation response, I don't really think it's relevant for our discussion here. Maybe separately, you want to give our answer rather than -- because, otherwise, they're pretty technical issue, our bank resolutions.\n\n---\n\nBack to the analyst, maybe gentleman in the back with the blue and gray tie.\n\n---\n\nGurpreet with Goldman Sachs. My question is on the slide. More specifically, on the equity derivatives. Would you say that the options could be cross listing of products when you are kind of tying up with the exchanges onshore in the equity derivatives? Or you're looking at leveraging the China Exchange services joint venture that you have and the index suits that the...\n\n---\n\nWhat's the second you said?\n\n---\n\nThe China Exchange services joint venture and the indices that, that company produces. And then I have a second question, please.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I think it will be a combination of everything. We will potentially look at the future Connect. Our liquidity can treat their contract. Their liquidity can treat our contract just like how Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect works. Or alternatively before that happens, we could also potentially consider cross-listing each other's product. And also, we could also talk about whether or not the joint venture index is something that the index that is developed by the joint venture. We can launch futures product on top of that as well. Obviously, we wanted to find area where we can achieve fast, quick and a large scale success first rather than develop this thing from the scratch, and trying to grow it organically. We are looking for potentially big wins if we are able to secure that.\n\n---\n\nVery quickly, would you put a single-stock derivatives also on that list because you said timeline could be this year or only index derivatives, given that onshore doesn't have single-stock options as of now?\n\n---\n\nI think once at a time. Ultimately, these things should be included, but the initial -- we are going to do everything. It's like Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect, we started with 20, 90 [ph] some stocks. I think by the time Shenzhen is announced and is launched, we potentially could increase that. We could potentially increase the capacity, increase the quota, a number of things we can do in the equity derivatives and in commodities. We are all likely going to start something meaningful and giving people a clear idea as to where it's going to go, and then -- but limit it in some ways so that people get comfortable. And then very quickly, subsequent to it, add to more capacity and more product and more range of capabilities.\n\n---\n\nOkay. I think I see Luke on the far side with...\n\n---\n\n[Chinese] I've got one question. In the initial stages of the Hong Kong Shanghai Stock, we know that some of the European U.S. funds, they did not participate and have we solved that problem yet? Second, with CFFEX, we have a futures connect. And I would like to ask, would we have some new index products so that MSEI could consider it? And some journalists have asked the question about the renewal of your contract, and you have said that you've already said what you need to say with the Chairman of the Board. And could you please tell us how much you love about this job and would you like to stay in this job for long?\n\n---\n\nWell, for this European, U.S. fund, and there were mainly 2 issues. First is prechecking. And this problem, we have already solved it. This is no longer a major issue. And secondly, the compliance departments, they need to resolve the issue of the nominee. And basically, this is the internal compliance departments of the funds. They still have a lot of questions around it, so we've been doing a lot of explanation. And the CSRC are also doing a lot of work to explain their rules. And our General Counsel, Christine Wong, and our legal team and the team from CSRC, they are doing the roadshow in Europe and the U.S. And they are communicating actively with them. So with more understanding and with the time passing by, I believe that all of these issues could be resolved. So a year later, in a year's time, if the law of the China's Security Laws can be revised and if we could put all the items in there, actually, a lot of these things are allowed, but then we still need to put them down in the legal documents. So I don't think these are real problems. And in terms of futures and index, are we going to do it with CFFEX or are we going to start doing part of it ourselves? To start with, again, we will be making announcement very soon and we would like to be give very clear announcements to everyone in terms of our strategies and steps. Perhaps, we're going to tell you whether we're going to start connecting all at once or we're only going to be doing partly of that, and I believe that this will be answered very clearly in the next few months. In terms of my contract, it is either yes or no. Once, it's -- either way, we need to announce it very quickly. I don't know whether it's yes or no at the moment, so we are still in this gray area. And I can't say anything to you and there is no meaning for me to say. For me, I love challenges and I love challenging jobs. I love changes. I love interesting stuff. I love jobs where intelligent people work together. This is my requirements for my career and this has always been a consideration when I look at jobs and look at opportunities. And for this position, it meets all my requirements. And for future opportunities, I believe that it must be intellectually challenging for people. And any time those few things are coming together, that will be the future. I will be pursuing my future career. Assuming whatever I am to pursue, the other side want to pursue together with me. With that...\n\n---\n\nI think we can take one more.\n\n---\n\nOkay.\n\n---\n\nThe lady here, second row, right here behind -- yes.\n\n---\n\n[Chinese] I've got 2 questions. First, concerning the preparation for Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect and compare it with preparation for Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect, what's the difference between the 2 process? And also, you are now laying the groundwork for the Shenzhen Connect. What are the difficulties you are facing and what's the biggest difficulty?\n\n---\n\nI think that biggest difference between the 2 processes was back then, you really didn't really know whether it would \r\n[Audio Gap]\r\nor know that it has won everybody's support, and it is workable. Now for Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect. Actually, when we are preparing for it, we are actually thinking beyond Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect. Everybody involved in it actually is now shouldering more responsibility and it's benefiting from more opportunities. And also the horizon is not much wider. And of course, there are a fresh set of uncertainties. And so Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect cannot be taken as simply a replica of Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect because that would be pointless. I think the entire team in terms of concept, in terms of philosophy, in terms of outlook actually has taken a great leap forward from Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect when we are preparing for Shenzhen-Hong Kong connect. We are a leader in our field. We are the leader in our market, and so we really have to go for breakthroughs. And we really have to have a whole new vision, and we have to reinvent ourselves and reinvent our vision. And the entire management and the entire policy-making level is all very confident in the way forward. Now as I said, we are going to rebuild the market infrastructure. And after you have given the clear explanation, then the whole team will be well poised to find the best way forward, and we are going to find a way that is best for Hong Kong. But we definitely cannot find a way that is best for Hong Kong, but worse for others. We have to find a way that is best for Hong Kong as well as for the other side, so that it becomes a win-win scenario. And that is why our vision has become much wider. When it comes to Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect, we are now at a tipping point. We are now at a very critical point. And we are at a point where we can't [ph] practically guarantee and underwrite Hong Kong's prosperity for the coming decade. And Hong Kong is really being given a God-given, and that is one country to a system concept under China. And so Hong Kong can really work magic in order to bring benefits, both to Hong Kong as well as to China. And so if you look at it from this angle, when we prepare for Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect, it is quite different from when we are preparing for Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect because our horizon and vision has become much more broadened. Of course, the management is under a lot of pressure. And my colleagues have been complaining and whining, why do you also have to take the lead, why do you also have to stay so much ahead of everybody else, or why can't we just rest on our laurel and take a break? And maybe if you look at this proposed infrastructure, you know that, actually, we are really ahead of our time, ahead of our pack. Because when you take the entire package together, you know that it would mean sea change to our market dynamics, and so on and so forth. But that's exactly where the opportunities are, and that's why we have to grasp them. And so we are creating new pressure and new responsibility for us and at the same time, we are looking forward to new good developments that will be made possible.\n\n---\n\nThere was a legal decision in the U.S., I believe overnight, dismissing LME Holdings and HKEx. And what that impact might be on HKEx's legal costs going forward, any guidance there?\n\n---\n\nI want Garry to answer at least one question because he is here. And so, Garry, why don't you quickly answer that question?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Very significant news overnight. As you know, there was a class-action suit against the LME, LME Holdings and the Hong Kong Exchange. The LME had already won immunity from prosecution on behalf of its own regulatory requirements in the sense that acting in its regulatory performance could not be held accountable for this particular case. However, LME Holdings is a holding company above the LME, between the LME and the Hong Kong Exchange, that was dragged in we think, not particularly, importantly, there's nothing insignificant about that. I think Hong Kong Exchange was dragged in as the new owner, given that the events that it referred to Hong Kong Exchange didn't even own the LME, who was always going to be something we defended very strongly. But very importantly, it was determined that LME Holdings Hong Kong did not have enough loci of business, i.e. they weren't significant players in the U.S. to be involved in this sort of lawsuit for a business happening in the U.S. We weren't buying and selling anything in the U.S. related to the case. So we've been dismissed from that as well with Hong Kong Exchange and Holdings. Now of course, the U.S. legal system, as you know, is very torturous. It doesn't mean there can't be appeals, et cetera. We're in a very good position, and this coming on top of when the judicial review against Rusal [ph] in the High Court in London was also on the LME. We're doing pretty well. I know we're doing pretty well because we were never guilty of these things in the first place. And we're doing our best to reform our warehouse structures, the big announcement last week about that. We're definitely going in the right direction. And as Charles and Paul have already described, the financial results of the LME Group, hopefully, 20% of the financial result for the group next year will definitely go in the right direction. On top of that, we've launched Asia commodities this year and are going to be a part of the long-term scenario that Charles has outlined here. So we're very positive and very confident about our business at the moment, and it's definitely going in the right direction.\n\n---\n\n[Chinese] Well, I'll repeat this in Chinese again. And now I mean, in this litigation in the U.S., and we have a warehouse. We supervise this warehouse. And before we have bought LME. And some of the Americans who are aluminum traders, they say that we need to do more supervision in terms of warehouse. So we were doing revolution and we were looking at how to revise the current system. Then when we're doing the revision, some of the major factories in London, they told us we should not be doing the revision. So those are the histories. And the litigations in the U.K., that all have been dismissed and we have won those cases. And so we have gained all the legal fees that we paid in the past because those who lose, they need to pay for the legal fees. In terms of the U.S., currently, we have also won those litigation cases. However, the warehouse revision were reformed. It's still going on. And perhaps in the next few days where you'll hear some news about some more litigations, some more cases. If you want to do business in the U.S., you need to solve the issue of the manufacturer, et cetera. So as the middleman, of course, you will face controversies. So in order to go out to face the world, to have the opportunities, and there will be controversies and conflicts, but to this date, 2 litigations in the U.S. and in the U.K., we have both won it. And that has occurred, a lot of legal fees in the past, but the losers, they have -- they are shouldering the fees. And going forward, there might also be other crazy people who might try -- be trying to sue us, but we will be making sure that we are doing the right thing and we'll win the cases.",

I do have 3 questions. York Pun from HSBC. The first 2 are financial related, the last one is strategy. The Stock Connect has bring in HKD 68 million revenue in 2014. Can you give us more color how much of it comes from clearing and trading? How much of it might be from the, say, one-off photo [ph] sales? And then LME, I think unlike in last year, this year, you haven't provided specific discussion on LME's performance. But I think we're quite interested to know what's the profit growth of LME in 2014? And with the fee commercialization, how this profitability has further trended year to date? I think, Charles, the last question is for you. In the past, you mentioned that China is on the way to become a net capital exporter, and Hong Kong is on the way to benefit. I think in the recent financial picture, our Financial Secretary also asked Hong Kong to capture the opportunity from this and especially the [indiscernible] policy. So as a leading financial organization in Hong Kong, how do you position for this?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Xiao Jia Li (Executives)】\nOkay. Paul, why don't you answer the first 2 questions. But before Paul does, I think it's important to look at the Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect revenue carefully because this is really, as I said, is ecosystem. The $68 million include one-time items and a -- but the going -- but the regular ongoing piece is smaller than that, and Paul is going to go into some granular detail. But the most important thing to remember is that the Connect revenue that we're booking here are purely directly the revenue-sharing part of it. But Connect is bringing tremendous amount of changes in our ADT, and in particular, not only the level of ADT, but the mix of the ADT. So if you want to think about Connect, think about Connect as a physical connection first. It's the physical -- the physics are changing because things are -- water are flowing into different directions, are changing. But the more important, which is not completely visible in our financial reflections going forward, is the chemical change. The chemical change, the 2 market are becoming very different. The different markets are coming together. DNAs are changing, and they're transforming a nice step. And we will start to see the ADT and then the activeness of the trading becoming very, very different. And LME, I think, Paul can also give, but the LME result, I think going forward, I don't know how much Paul can tell you, this last year, LME very strong. But LME Clear only have 1 quarter’s of operation but booked a full quarter's of cost. So this coming year, we will see LME contribution becoming very significant. Our overall anticipation is that LME will become 20% of our business -- more than 20% of our business, could easily be more than 20% of our business, our revenue. And I think the margin is going to be approaching to 60 or upper mid-60s sort of a margin range. Paul? And I'll answer the last question later.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Kennedy (Executives)】\nThank you, Charles and York. To touch on Stock Connect, it's very early days to be talking about specific direct income kind of Stock Connect. And as Charles said, a lot of the financial impact now is from the, if you like, the halo effect that's been created. If you look at the fourth quarter ADT at over 80 billion, which was a significant jump from the previous quarter, you have to question, I think, and we certainly believe that part of that is due to the Stock Connect effect, if you like. In terms of the actual numbers, we've disclosed the Stock Connect direct income of $68 million. $48 million of that was one-off, is due to the purchase of equipment throttles which participants have purchased to enter the market. At the moment, you all know the volumes, 4 billion to 5 billion of northbound, 1 billion southbound. The southbound is included in our general ADT numbers, but the northbound, being Asia purchases, isn't. So that's pure incremental. And obviously, we like to see these numbers grow. But I think it really is early days to try and forecast forward. And not that I could anyway, but to forecast forward at this stage, I think, is premature, but that's the actual breakdown to date. To talk about LME, again without giving specific numbers, we've previously given guidance based on the income that LCH have disclosed. And essentially, we've taken over that income based on the same clearing fee, which indicates fees somewhere in the region of USD 90 million for LME Clear. And we've also previously said we would expect the margin on that to be in the mid-60s, possibly a touch higher. So a good healthy margin approaching what we earned at the group level. On the LME side, we publicly said that the average trading fee has gone up by 31%. That -- I'm sorry, the average transaction fee has gone up by 31%. That includes the clearing fee. So the trading fee has gone up obviously by proportionately more. As to the volume or the income next year, I think the best guidance I can give you is that we would expect the LME Group to account for a little north of 20% of our group results next year. So it's a significant jump from where it is at the moment. And hopefully, that will give you a flavor of the significant increase we would see, hope to see coming through from LME and LME Clear next year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Xiao Jia Li (Executives)】\nOn your third question is really what we're going to have -- what do we need to do, Hong Kong needs to do, in order to really be more competitive and to be relevant. I think we are faced with huge challenges because the last 20 years, we actually didn't have to do too much because we represent capital. We have the capital, China need the capital. They need to fit themselves into our rules, into our practices, need to accommodate our practices in order to make it happen. By sheer fact that we have the capital, we have a great, sound market infrastructure and legal structure that international investor trusts, and therefore, the Chinese issuers have to come. But they're limited in numbers because, today, we have about 1,600 company listed, 60 -- and maybe just over 1,000 companies, you only need to deal with 1,000 companies for them to make a decision to list only one's [ph] decision and then all the trading is happening here. So Hong Kong Inc., Hong Kong does not have to do a whole lot, and we have been very successful the last -- which is our system, our market is more sophisticated and they don't. Today, they're catching up. So they no longer have the situations where they have to go through Hong Kong. There are many ways now. Their capital need a home, and Hong Kong is not necessarily the only destination. And their issuers, the companies are able to access domestic capital. In many ways, the domestic capital is more attractive than in Hong Kong market because of the valuation gap, because of the massive liquidity there. So therefore, today, in order for us to do what we're talking about here, we need to really change fast. We need to make sure that the differences we have with their market is continued to be maintained. We used to be, let's say, 50% better, that's why people come or international investors like us. Today, that may already being shrinked to 20%, 30%. We need to continue to move ahead. But more importantly, we really are dealing with investors now. We start to deal with Chinese and international investors on large scales. The Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect clearly indicated the tremendous amount of consultation we have to have to market, because the market needs to tell us whether Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect works, whether people actually wants to trade. One of the things you have to do in order for them to feel comfortable to trade, you actually have to do a lot of work rather than just sit and that the market will be here. We have to sell. We have to make the channel works. We have to continue to eliminate the differences. On the other hand, we have to also figure out what the domestic markets constraints are, what their desires are, what is their aspiration, how the domestic investors want to trade. We have to really -- we -- out of -- sort of start to find our stakeholders are much more numerous, are much more broad, and we now actually have to be a lot more accommodating. So in order for us to do all of this, we need to understand them better, we need to change some of the things, we need to do things we have never done before. We need to purchase and acquire capabilities that we don't have before. So we have a huge advantage in terms of being trusted by China, being trusted by international investors' community. But we have to have all the tools and we have to have all the solutions in order to deliver what is needed. So it's going to be difficult and it's not going to be easy. But the Connect is launched, and we lock ourselves into a good pattern of work and we just have to keep on delivering in time. We keep -- have to make sure that for those players who represent China's investors and for many of the investors that we continue to be the best, easiest market for them to access because, today, they have choices. And I would be surprised if domestic changes, over the coming weeks and months, start to announce international alliances, international connectivity programs. They are doing it now, I know for a fact, and they will be announcing them. We just need to make sure that we are constantly ahead of the pack. We are constant delivering a solution that better fit, and we are delivering a solution that nobody else can deliver, and that's how we are able to succeed.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nAny questions on the -- maybe Eric in the front row?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Eric Chan (Attendees)】\nEric from the Hong Kong Economic Times. Charles, you just talked about you're expecting a big step forward in the months to come in the international of renminbi. And actually -- or could you elaborate a bit on what are you expecting actually? And shall that be the connectability of renminbi or in what way -- and in what way that will affect the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Xiao Jia Li (Executives)】\nYes. I don't -- I'm not part of the China's regulatory establishment. I do -- I have a lot of discussions with them. It is my personal belief, as I do not represent anybody making any announcement that, that pace will accelerate in terms of they're going to make it very easy for people to exchange. They're going to make it very easy for people to swap renminbi into U.S. dollar -- into Hong Kong dollars and vice versa, and that they are very -- the strong differentiation, all the barriers between CNH and CNY, which is basically offshore renminbi and onshore renminbi, I think that wall and that, that differentiation or segregation is going to become a lot blurrier. And then I think because of the very healthy changes in renminbi exchange rate on both side of the range and then for the last year, China has not really actively intervened in the exchange rate market. That just indicated a strong -- that has given China Inc., I believe, a higher -- much higher level of confidence that this is something that they can afford to create a much greater regime for renminbi to be exchanged more readily and more freely and without artificial barriers onshore and offshore. Exactly how fast they will move it and how easy they will move it, I don't really know. But I do expect that sometime later this year, we will see significant changes for the better. Any movement, any change that is going to make it easier for people to change currencies and to hold, and exchange, and trade and return back to their original currency, any efforts to do that is going to make Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect works. Obviously, the current model works a particular way. If they changed, we may want to change. If we do change, there might be some small inconvenience that we have to make adjustment on. But overall, those changes are better for the capital flows. So that all the artificial barriers that is creating restrictive, creating friction -- increasing friction cost of those change is going to dramatically coming down and that's the direction. I know you wanted something more specific, and I probably shouldn't really comment on something that I don't know or whether or not it will become official policy. So let's wait for them to announce, if they're going to go announce it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nGet back maybe to the analyst side, are there other analyst's questions on my left?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Xiao Jia Li (Executives)】\nI saw some friend in the media laughing. Some of them told me that every time I speak, they like it, until later on when they started to write the article, they said, \"The guy said a lot of things interesting, but we couldn't write anything because he didn't say anything much at all.\" So maybe I just did that. Sorry about it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nOkay. We're also taking some questions from the Internet. We have -- we're live on -- be able to be watched by media and told we have one question from Shanghai for Charles asking why do you think there's been no short-selling and there was no short-selling in the first couple of days under Stock Connect's northbound trading?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Xiao Jia Li (Executives)】\nI actually don't know, but I'm sure that the fact that it's not easy to borrow has something to do with it. And so this is one of the -- again, this is one of the little access road. We build the bridge, which is the Connect, there are many access road we're going to built to make overall the traffic move it easier. Short-selling is one more access road that will help, and we build it. It's open for traffic now, and we haven't seen any cars yet. And I'm not worried about it. It's very important to get that open. So people need to understand why this is the case. In China, there's a very significant regulatory structure in place on short-selling. The domestic market infrastructure is so transparent and so easy to enforce the rules that they are able to put many of the regulatory requirements of short-selling into the software, into the see-through systems in China. So therefore, they are able to save 25% control, and they can control it. Obviously, when short-selling is permitted in Hong Kong, the initial discussion with Shanghai is that, why don't you replicate the domestic type of see-through system in Hong Kong then you can do as much short-selling as the domestic investors. We obviously didn't want to do that because our system works very differently. So as part of the compromise, we agreed, you don't make us change, but you can control the pipe first. And then -- but towards the end, we did make some changes, particularly about the -- and then who is eligible to lend. Right now, we included only the brokers and the broker affiliates, and many of the custodian banks and others are not yet part of the program. I think that's one of the reasons in the international market that people who have the shares, if they're not able to lend, and then obviously, there are not a lot of shares to borrow from. So I think -- and then -- but we're not concerned. The first thing we -- the most important is that it launched. The traffic, the road is open. And then we will begin to think about and how to work with the traffic, and that we will also show Shanghai and Shenzhen the domestic regulators how our market works. If they don't see any short-selling, they will say, \"Oh, nothing to worry about it. Maybe we can allow you to make this change, maybe we can allow the pipe to go up a little bit.\" So this is not necessarily a bad thing. And I think if the short-selling, we started the first day, a massive amount of short-selling, that, obviously, will make it difficult. Again, I didn't say much.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nOkay, I think there's a question here in the center, the lady in white with the green jacket.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\n[Chinese] An analyst already asked about Shanghai Connect and its contribution to your profitability. Can you give your answer again in Chinese? The second question is, today, [indiscernible] Li said that he was going to be committed now to expediting the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect. And last time, when [indiscernible] Li talked about Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect, very soon afterwards, it was launched. And what do you think is the right time for Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect? And today, a Risk Committee is being set up by the Hong Kong Exchange. I'd like to know what exactly is it for. And also, if there is time, because your contract is going to be up in October...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nI think each of you is allowed only 3 questions at a time.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Xiao Jia Li (Executives)】\nNow after the Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect has been launched and the direct and one-off contribution to our profitability, of course, is considerable. And this is because the players will have to participate in the market immediately. And after they have completed the trading, they have to pay a fee and so and so forth. And my colleagues, just now, has already mentioned this. And the other part of the income is in direct, the profit sharing between Shanghai Exchange and Hong Kong Exchange. And as long as the volume keeps building, then the profit would keep building. It's been around only for 1.5 months. And every day, it is ongoing. And the profit is being shared every day between the 2 exchanges. And thirdly, now because of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect, because of the launch of this mechanism, the exchange in Shanghai as well as exchange in Hong Kong have both benefited in terms of the increase in volume. And that really is the largest part of contribution to our profitability, but it's difficult to quantify this particular segment. And then the most important contribution is [indiscernible] contribution. Now because of Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect, the 2 volumes of trading actually are now merged and linked together. And one exchange actually is very corporatized and the other exchange is very individualized, and so each has its own chemistry. But because of the Connect, now both exchanges are benefiting in the sense that they have become more disciplined and they have benefited from getting linked up with each other. And so in terms of circulation and in terms of volume and the building up of trading, there has been chemical benefits to both exchanges. And then Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect, of course, it's only a matter of time. It's no longer of any news value. And [indiscernible] Li asked about -- what's being asked about the timing for Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect, and he said that it will be launched sometime, and so that's exactly what he mean. I think for the IT system to become ready, I think it's going to take a few more months. And Chairman Shing Kwong [ph] has already mentioned that it's likely that announcement will be made in the first half of this year. And so I think this is already in the public domain, it really does not need me to announce. As for Risk Management committee, under the SFO, there is a provision for the setting up of the Risk Management Committee comprising representatives from various quarters of society as well as SFC, as well as Hong Kong Monetary Authority and so on and so forth. And Risk Management Committee should be the principal Risk Management Committee for Hong Kong Exchange. Because Hong Kong Stock Exchange work in the past, it used to be more straightforward. And so the Risk Management Committee used to be more concerned with the overall discipline of the market and the overall risk management of the market. But during the past 5 years, Hong Kong Stock Exchange has moved principally towards internationalization and towards derivatives and also of getting merged with other exchanges. And that is why the risk requirement has become far in exceedance of the original ambit of the Risk Management Committee, and that is why the Hong Kong Stock Exchange needs its own dedicated Risk Management Committee to look at Hong Kong Stock Exchange's new portfolio and also what kind of impact did we have on the overall financial market of Hong Kong and also how such risk can be best managed. Now because of hackers impact on the Internet, Hong Kong Stock Exchange may face a certain Internet race. And this is something that is under the ambit of Hong Kong Stock Exchange's in-house committee and it is answerable to the board.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nThe questions from the floor, maybe an analyst side again, if not -- okay, this lady here, third row in the tan jacket.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nI'm [indiscernible] from Maybank Kim Eng. You mentioned earlier that you know for a fact that speaking to other exchanges for connection and interlink outside of Hong Kong, which -- who is your biggest competitor? Will they be looking for something out in Europe, a different time zone? Or are we looking at Asian competitors, specifically Singapore, because there's already news about it? So do you worry about that? The second question I have is in that box, the blue box. So we know the equity side, what is the next box you think that you will focus on because Shenzhen Connect is a matter of time? Is it commodities, fixed income, currency? And timing maybe, any indication? I think that will be it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Xiao Jia Li (Executives)】\nOkay. I think I'm not worried about if they want to talk to everybody else. In fact, I feel very encouraged they do because the fact they're able to talk to other exchanges is a clear milestone. If they actually announce anything, it's a milestone of the mindset change in that market opening. And so if they are able to actually open up something with somebody else, it will be tremendous. Just think about it. We are really -- I think in the old days, in the last 20 years, this IPO regime that we have, they all come here. We are -- Hong Kong is becoming very comfortable and is almost feeling very entitled to some sort of exclusive deal with China, that you have to go through us, and we are here. And you shouldn't really be dealing with anybody else, otherwise, you become a competitor. I actually do not think of -- in those terms at all because we're really talking about, let's say, China does not grow, we are talking about USD 22 trillion have to move in somewhere over the next 5 to 10 years. Their equity market is going to double or even triple over the next 10 years. The opportunity is so much so that we want everybody to provide market, product and opportunities for them. We want those exchanges to really go around the world to see whether they can get more activities. Because the more activities they create, the more dynamic China become, the more comfortable the Chinese leadership becomes in terms of line opening. Because if we continued to deliver all of the things we're doing here, we are always going to be taking a huge chunk, if not the largest chunk of this business. And the more they do on the fringe, the better for the core. So I actually do not consider that to be a competitor. So they could be talking to some European exchanges. They could be talking to Singapore or Tokyo. They could even be talking to some U.S. exchanges. I will be very surprised if in the next 12 months, we do not see 2 or 3 major announcements, and so much so and so much the better. And also, every time they talk to somebody else, they're going to come back and feel what a wonderful partner Hong Kong Stock Exchange is. Second question is, I apologize, I'm getting...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nThe next Connect, the next Connect.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Xiao Jia Li (Executives)】\nOh, right. In terms of timing, well, timing is this, this, this, this is timing. But we are here. We're halfway here. So this year, we are going to complete this. We probably -- this 2, probably will happen sometime. We will have something that we can tell you in greater and more granular details. Hopefully, sometime second half of this year. And this is probably, again, while speculation that we will begin to think about it and talk about it sometime, let's say, this time next year. And fixed income and the currency, we already have currency. But these 2 are very -- we could become -- we already have a lot of discussions. We're going to have FICC conference in June. But I think this 2, over longer period of time, are very big, but it takes some initial efforts trying to connect it. It's not about regulatory policy or -- it's talking about find the right way of doing it because this is all about debt market and it's about the rates market. And in this market, we need to find our role between China, international, between the banks and the brokers, between the issuers and the investors. And we need to find a way where we can make our money and we can make it big successful. At the same time, we are very important to all the key players. OTC Clear could become a very part of this, but this is probably -- so you have to really guess this is today, this is like -- if we, in the morning, we finish up, this will be in the afternoon or tomorrow morning, and this is going to be the day after tomorrow. Figuratively, again, I didn't say much.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nOkay. Other questions on the floor? We're getting down to the last few. So if you have a question, please do raise your hand. Maybe Peter in the center here. And then we go -- after Peter, I see Ashley in the back. So Peter and then Ashley.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Xiao Jia Li (Executives)】\nI tried to keep the answers short so that we have more questions, sorry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nI'll ask you a short question as well. Just on the -- I'm wondering about the investment involved in basically what you're talking about here and particularly, kind of what you -- what sort of orders of magnitude you're talking about. And also I'm just curious about how that might be financed because when I look at your balance sheet, you basically got no debt at all, and -- but you're also paying out 90% of your earnings as dividends. So how do you think about the investment, the balance sheet and the dividend?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Xiao Jia Li (Executives)】\nYes. I think all these business activities do not require us massive amount of money. Let's say, the Shenzhen, Shanghai, we're really talking about HKD 100 million, HKD 200 million type of OpEx, but this is a whole lot of people, a lot of overtime, IT, infrastructure, people. But we really -- even on -- even -- I think it's -- very similarly, we are not really talking about a significant amount of massive CapEx. We are not building anything. But because of we're doing all of these things as a new business and we cannot really continue to relying on our existing infrastructure, existing people, existing resources to keep on taxing the original and the current core business infrastructure. So over time, we have to build. We maybe have to build a secondary data center at some point. We have to build on the next trading platform, which is going to cost, let's say, HKD 300 million, HKD 400 million. And we may have to do something on our clearing infrastructure in the next 3 years. So we could see another wave of CapEx at some point, but we -- those are the money that we have to spend in order to keep our -- but those are other things that, essentially, you have to do, otherwise, you won't be able to achieve your strategic investments. So we can time it reasonably easily. We have done a 3-, 4-year, 5-year forecast, and Paul has done that, and I don't really think -- I think we're in good shape. But whether or not ultimately, at some point, we're going to review our dividend, scrip dividend policy, whether or not we're going to, at some point, review our dividend policy, this is all items and our future agenda that we will discuss. We're not ruling them off, but we're not making any decisions. We're not giving the market any indication or guidance on that particular direction.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nHave you seen Ashley? Get in the back, I think in the backroom. Maybe Vivian, closer to you. Thanks.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nTwo quick questions on risk. I'm Ashley from the International Financial Law Review. First, how do you plan to deal with overlap between the Risk Management Committee and the Risk Committee? And secondly, given the increase of importance in the clearing business, I guess, domestically, how are you going to deal with the Hong Kong Exchange's role in relation to the domestic bank resolution consultation from the HKMA, as well as broader global initiatives in relation to financial markets infrastructure?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Xiao Jia Li (Executives)】\nOkay, I will answer the first question between -- Paul, you want to talk about this consultation issues. I think the Risk Committee, the policy -- the stature in Risk Committee is more talking about Hong Kong market risk macro and also how Hong Kong Exchange in the context of that is going to react as managing its policies, managing its procedures. But the broad Risk Management Committee is much more focused on Hong Kong exchange itself. And our risk is really the first -- the biggest area of risk that we discuss is our CCP risk, Central Counterparty risk, because we're running a clearinghouse. And it's really about policy, about the margins, about collaterals, about the waterfalls, about our various capital efficiency, liquidity issues of our CCP. We also a talked ERM, our Enterprise Risk Management, which is about access, hyper security, and Internet security and others. So I think the 2 committees will have some overlapping in terms of overall market risk and -- but it would really not be -- broadly speaking, they're very, very different. But in terms of our -- the connectivity with China that is expose -- exposing China or exposing us to risks potentially from the other side of the market. I think, as you can see in the Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect, and we're going to essentially replicate that in all the other access product or access programs, essentially, is segregated. China Clear, for example, will provide separate margins, and they will not be responsible for Hong Kong resolution or Hong Kong default. And conversely, Hong Kong broker-dealers will not be responsible should China Clear default. And that the guarantee funds of Hong Kong is not going to be used to pay for a potential default of China Clear and that they actually do not. They're actually more worried about whether we're using their money to pay some of our brokers default, and then -- but then we charge substantial margins with China Clear and at a level significantly higher than what we are charging in Hong Kong. So because they have a much tightened and a more aggressive risk management measures that we are replicating and we are reciprocating with them. So I think that's really how that is done. But there, it's -- you're almost dealing with entity that have a sovereign risk profile. In terms of the consultation response, I don't really think it's relevant for our discussion here. Maybe separately, you want to give our answer rather than -- because, otherwise, they're pretty technical issue, our bank resolutions.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nBack to the analyst, maybe gentleman in the back with the blue and gray tie.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gurpreet Sahi (Analysts)】\nGurpreet with Goldman Sachs. My question is on the slide. More specifically, on the equity derivatives. Would you say that the options could be cross listing of products when you are kind of tying up with the exchanges onshore in the equity derivatives? Or you're looking at leveraging the China Exchange services joint venture that you have and the index suits that the...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Xiao Jia Li (Executives)】\nWhat's the second you said?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gurpreet Sahi (Analysts)】\nThe China Exchange services joint venture and the indices that, that company produces. And then I have a second question, please.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Xiao Jia Li (Executives)】\nOkay. I think it will be a combination of everything. We will potentially look at the future Connect. Our liquidity can treat their contract. Their liquidity can treat our contract just like how Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect works. Or alternatively before that happens, we could also potentially consider cross-listing each other's product. And also, we could also talk about whether or not the joint venture index is something that the index that is developed by the joint venture. We can launch futures product on top of that as well. Obviously, we wanted to find area where we can achieve fast, quick and a large scale success first rather than develop this thing from the scratch, and trying to grow it organically. We are looking for potentially big wins if we are able to secure that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gurpreet Sahi (Analysts)】\nVery quickly, would you put a single-stock derivatives also on that list because you said timeline could be this year or only index derivatives, given that onshore doesn't have single-stock options as of now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Xiao Jia Li (Executives)】\nI think once at a time. Ultimately, these things should be included, but the initial -- we are going to do everything. It's like Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect, we started with 20, 90 [ph] some stocks. I think by the time Shenzhen is announced and is launched, we potentially could increase that. We could potentially increase the capacity, increase the quota, a number of things we can do in the equity derivatives and in commodities. We are all likely going to start something meaningful and giving people a clear idea as to where it's going to go, and then -- but limit it in some ways so that people get comfortable. And then very quickly, subsequent to it, add to more capacity and more product and more range of capabilities.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nOkay. I think I see Luke on the far side with...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\n[Chinese] I've got one question. In the initial stages of the Hong Kong Shanghai Stock, we know that some of the European U.S. funds, they did not participate and have we solved that problem yet? Second, with CFFEX, we have a futures connect. And I would like to ask, would we have some new index products so that MSEI could consider it? And some journalists have asked the question about the renewal of your contract, and you have said that you've already said what you need to say with the Chairman of the Board. And could you please tell us how much you love about this job and would you like to stay in this job for long?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Xiao Jia Li (Executives)】\nWell, for this European, U.S. fund, and there were mainly 2 issues. First is prechecking. And this problem, we have already solved it. This is no longer a major issue. And secondly, the compliance departments, they need to resolve the issue of the nominee. And basically, this is the internal compliance departments of the funds. They still have a lot of questions around it, so we've been doing a lot of explanation. And the CSRC are also doing a lot of work to explain their rules. And our General Counsel, Christine Wong, and our legal team and the team from CSRC, they are doing the roadshow in Europe and the U.S. And they are communicating actively with them. So with more understanding and with the time passing by, I believe that all of these issues could be resolved. So a year later, in a year's time, if the law of the China's Security Laws can be revised and if we could put all the items in there, actually, a lot of these things are allowed, but then we still need to put them down in the legal documents. So I don't think these are real problems. And in terms of futures and index, are we going to do it with CFFEX or are we going to start doing part of it ourselves? To start with, again, we will be making announcement very soon and we would like to be give very clear announcements to everyone in terms of our strategies and steps. Perhaps, we're going to tell you whether we're going to start connecting all at once or we're only going to be doing partly of that, and I believe that this will be answered very clearly in the next few months. In terms of my contract, it is either yes or no. Once, it's -- either way, we need to announce it very quickly. I don't know whether it's yes or no at the moment, so we are still in this gray area. And I can't say anything to you and there is no meaning for me to say. For me, I love challenges and I love challenging jobs. I love changes. I love interesting stuff. I love jobs where intelligent people work together. This is my requirements for my career and this has always been a consideration when I look at jobs and look at opportunities. And for this position, it meets all my requirements. And for future opportunities, I believe that it must be intellectually challenging for people. And any time those few things are coming together, that will be the future. I will be pursuing my future career. Assuming whatever I am to pursue, the other side want to pursue together with me. With that...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nI think we can take one more.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Xiao Jia Li (Executives)】\nOkay.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nThe lady here, second row, right here behind -- yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\n[Chinese] I've got 2 questions. First, concerning the preparation for Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect and compare it with preparation for Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect, what's the difference between the 2 process? And also, you are now laying the groundwork for the Shenzhen Connect. What are the difficulties you are facing and what's the biggest difficulty?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Xiao Jia Li (Executives)】\nI think that biggest difference between the 2 processes was back then, you really didn't really know whether it would \r\n[Audio Gap]\r\nor know that it has won everybody's support, and it is workable. Now for Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect. Actually, when we are preparing for it, we are actually thinking beyond Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect. Everybody involved in it actually is now shouldering more responsibility and it's benefiting from more opportunities. And also the horizon is not much wider. And of course, there are a fresh set of uncertainties. And so Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect cannot be taken as simply a replica of Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect because that would be pointless. I think the entire team in terms of concept, in terms of philosophy, in terms of outlook actually has taken a great leap forward from Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect when we are preparing for Shenzhen-Hong Kong connect. We are a leader in our field. We are the leader in our market, and so we really have to go for breakthroughs. And we really have to have a whole new vision, and we have to reinvent ourselves and reinvent our vision. And the entire management and the entire policy-making level is all very confident in the way forward. Now as I said, we are going to rebuild the market infrastructure. And after you have given the clear explanation, then the whole team will be well poised to find the best way forward, and we are going to find a way that is best for Hong Kong. But we definitely cannot find a way that is best for Hong Kong, but worse for others. We have to find a way that is best for Hong Kong as well as for the other side, so that it becomes a win-win scenario. And that is why our vision has become much wider. When it comes to Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect, we are now at a tipping point. We are now at a very critical point. And we are at a point where we can't [ph] practically guarantee and underwrite Hong Kong's prosperity for the coming decade. And Hong Kong is really being given a God-given, and that is one country to a system concept under China. And so Hong Kong can really work magic in order to bring benefits, both to Hong Kong as well as to China. And so if you look at it from this angle, when we prepare for Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect, it is quite different from when we are preparing for Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect because our horizon and vision has become much more broadened. Of course, the management is under a lot of pressure. And my colleagues have been complaining and whining, why do you also have to take the lead, why do you also have to stay so much ahead of everybody else, or why can't we just rest on our laurel and take a break? And maybe if you look at this proposed infrastructure, you know that, actually, we are really ahead of our time, ahead of our pack. Because when you take the entire package together, you know that it would mean sea change to our market dynamics, and so on and so forth. But that's exactly where the opportunities are, and that's why we have to grasp them. And so we are creating new pressure and new responsibility for us and at the same time, we are looking forward to new good developments that will be made possible.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nThere was a legal decision in the U.S., I believe overnight, dismissing LME Holdings and HKEx. And what that impact might be on HKEx's legal costs going forward, any guidance there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Xiao Jia Li (Executives)】\nI want Garry to answer at least one question because he is here. And so, Garry, why don't you quickly answer that question?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Garry Jones (Executives)】\nOkay. Very significant news overnight. As you know, there was a class-action suit against the LME, LME Holdings and the Hong Kong Exchange. The LME had already won immunity from prosecution on behalf of its own regulatory requirements in the sense that acting in its regulatory performance could not be held accountable for this particular case. However, LME Holdings is a holding company above the LME, between the LME and the Hong Kong Exchange, that was dragged in we think, not particularly, importantly, there's nothing insignificant about that. I think Hong Kong Exchange was dragged in as the new owner, given that the events that it referred to Hong Kong Exchange didn't even own the LME, who was always going to be something we defended very strongly. But very importantly, it was determined that LME Holdings Hong Kong did not have enough loci of business, i.e. they weren't significant players in the U.S. to be involved in this sort of lawsuit for a business happening in the U.S. We weren't buying and selling anything in the U.S. related to the case. So we've been dismissed from that as well with Hong Kong Exchange and Holdings. Now of course, the U.S. legal system, as you know, is very torturous. It doesn't mean there can't be appeals, et cetera. We're in a very good position, and this coming on top of when the judicial review against Rusal [ph] in the High Court in London was also on the LME. We're doing pretty well. I know we're doing pretty well because we were never guilty of these things in the first place. And we're doing our best to reform our warehouse structures, the big announcement last week about that. We're definitely going in the right direction. And as Charles and Paul have already described, the financial results of the LME Group, hopefully, 20% of the financial result for the group next year will definitely go in the right direction. On top of that, we've launched Asia commodities this year and are going to be a part of the long-term scenario that Charles has outlined here. So we're very positive and very confident about our business at the moment, and it's definitely going in the right direction.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Xiao Jia Li (Executives)】\n[Chinese] Well, I'll repeat this in Chinese again. And now I mean, in this litigation in the U.S., and we have a warehouse. We supervise this warehouse. And before we have bought LME. And some of the Americans who are aluminum traders, they say that we need to do more supervision in terms of warehouse. So we were doing revolution and we were looking at how to revise the current system. Then when we're doing the revision, some of the major factories in London, they told us we should not be doing the revision. So those are the histories. And the litigations in the U.K., that all have been dismissed and we have won those cases. And so we have gained all the legal fees that we paid in the past because those who lose, they need to pay for the legal fees. In terms of the U.S., currently, we have also won those litigation cases. However, the warehouse revision were reformed. It's still going on. And perhaps in the next few days where you'll hear some news about some more litigations, some more cases. If you want to do business in the U.S., you need to solve the issue of the manufacturer, et cetera. So as the middleman, of course, you will face controversies. So in order to go out to face the world, to have the opportunities, and there will be controversies and conflicts, but to this date, 2 litigations in the U.S. and in the U.K., we have both won it. And that has occurred, a lot of legal fees in the past, but the losers, they have -- they are shouldering the fees. And going forward, there might also be other crazy people who might try -- be trying to sue us, but we will be making sure that we are doing the right thing and we'll win the cases.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thanks very much, operator, and good day, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our interim results conference call today. Joining me here in Johannesburg from Sasol are Bongani Nqwababa, our new Chief Financial Officer, who started at Sasol on March 1. A warm welcome to Bongani. Also on the call is Paul Victor, who has been an outstanding and extremely dedicated acting Chief Financial Officer, who will support me on today's call. We also have with us other members of the Sasol group executive committee, who will support us and respond to any questions you may have.\r\nAs you would have seen, today, we announced a resilient group-wide performance, notwithstanding an extremely tough macroeconomic environment, despite the implementation of a major corporate restructuring, our colleagues throughout the world have maintained their focus on safety, volume growth, increased sales in key strategic projects.\r\nTurning to Slide 4 in the pack. We'll cover the following key messages today: I'll begin by providing you with a high-level overview of how our optimized operating model is providing Sasol a solid platform to weather even the most severe of storms; next, we'll spend some time reviewing our key performance achievements during the first half of the 2015 financial year; I'll then provide you with an update on one of our most important initiatives, our Business Performance Enhancement Program. \r\nOf course, it's clear that the current crude oil price presents challenging times for us. Instrumental to our ability to ride out the storm and maintain our momentum is our response to the low oil price environment.\r\nIn December, the management team launched our oil price Response Plan. Today, we'll update you on the cash conservation levers we are actioning as part of this plan. Paul will then go into more detail on our financial and operational performance.\r\nBefore wrapping up, I'll talk you through the advancements we've been making on our dual regional strategic, primarily focusing on our Lake Charles Chemicals Project in the U.S. And we'll conclude this morning's session by recapping how Sasol continues to create value by proactively prioritizing our business activities.\r\nMoving on to slide 5. On July 1, we implemented a completely revamped operating model. 8 months down the track, we definitely see us gaining traction and delivering results. Our new operating model aligns operating business units, regional operating hubs, strategic business units and group functions into an integrated value chain, producing liquid fuels, high-value chemicals and low carbon electricity.\r\nHaving implemented our new model at the start of this financial year, we also updated our financial reporting according to the new reportable segments. This slide summarizes the key operating model benefits, which you will be familiar with so I will not go into any further detail here. \r\nHowever, one important takeaway is that through our internal consolidation and rightsizing, we've radically streamlined our management layers. In fact, since 2013, we have reduced our top management layer by 61%. This reduction was brought about by more efficient reporting lines and by maximizing economies of scale.\r\nNext is Slide 6. And looking at our interim results, we have solid contributions across the value chain. In addition, our group safety recordable case rate, excluding illnesses, improved to 0.32, down appreciably from 0.36 at the start of the financial year. \r\nTurning to our sales volumes. Performance chemicals were up 5%, base chemicals normalized sales volumes were up 1%, and liquid fuels sales in our energy business in Southern Africa were up 3%. Through determined management action, our normalized cash fixed costs have continued trend below inflation at 6.1% versus the South African PPI of 6.8% for the half year. \r\nOver the period, headline earnings per share were up 6% to ZAR 32 per share and earnings per share increased by 53% to ZAR 32.04. The half year had a number once-off items which, for the most part, impacted our performance positively and Paul will explain the items further in just a few minutes. \r\nWith significantly lower oil prices, the management team and the board revisited our group's dividend policy. Last month, we moved away from a progressive dividend to a dividend cover range based on headline earnings per share. As a result, the company has declared an interim dividend of ZAR 7 per share for the first half of FY '15, not dissimilar to last year's record interim dividend of ZAR 8 per share.\r\nTurning to Slide 7. In the context of our large-scale change program, which commenced in 2011, we refined our corporate strategy, streamlined our management structures, we adapted our systems and processes and drove a comprehensive Business Performance Enhancement Program. Today, as we navigate our way through a challenging global reality, it's reassuring to know that at Sasol we have been fixing the roof while the sun was shining. As a result and with our company redesign fully implemented, we are much better equipped to deal with any challenge.\r\nLooking at some of the specific details of our enhancement program. By December 31, we'd signed off on approximately 1,500 employment separations, either through voluntary retrenchments or early retirements; we implemented a group-wide vacancy freeze and a hiring moratorium, which today are both delivering additional benefits to our cost optimization endeavors.\r\nAs a result of our intensified efforts, we have increased our program target from at least ZAR 4 billion in annual savings to ZAR 4.3 billion at the end of FY '16. If we look at our sustainable savings to date, we are sitting at ZAR 1 billion annually with restructuring charges of approximately ZAR 1.5 billion. However, in the context of a lower-for-longer oil scenario, our change program efforts, although significant, are not sufficient. If we consider the views of external experts and the prevailing market sentiment, far more has to be done. \r\nTurning next to the graph on Slide 8. Over the past several months, we've seen a sharp decline in the average Brent crude oil price. This has had a severe knock-on effect on everyone in or affiliated with the oil industry. Forecasting the oil price trajectory remains challenging as the market is still in the process of determining a new short-term equilibrium price. Equally difficult is predicting when supply and demand will become more balanced, in parallel, storage constraints and geopolitical tensions must also be considered.\r\nWhat we know for certain is that current oil prices are too low to sustain drilling programs or to provide incentives for new upstream investments. Companies within this sector is substantially reducing their capital requirements and cutting exploration budgets.\r\nAs is the case with our industry peers, we too are hampered by what many external experts expect to be a lower-for-longer oil scenario, until at least mid-2016. In the longer term, the rebalancing of the supply-demand market will require additional volumes to replace global oil production declines coupled with demand growth. This is evident from the oval shading in the graph, which indicates the recovery to $80 dollars per barrel in FY '17. So today's outlook is quite different to how we viewed the world only a few months ago. As a result, in December 2014, we proactively formulated a comprehensive plan to protect cash in response to these oil-price uncertainties. \r\nMoving on to slide 9 come, having done considerable legwork, our Response Plan caters for a cash conservation target range of between ZAR 30 billion to ZAR 50 billion over the next 30 months. In all the activities we are working on to protect cash, safe, reliable and efficient operations remain non-negotiable for us. Response Plan has flexible levers so that we can respond to the volatile macroeconomic environment, while optimizing our ultimate profitability over the long term.\r\nThe cash conservation levers we have formulated under the Response Plan are over and above the Business Performance Enhancement Program savings targets. And while our Response Plan protects cash over a relatively short period, the next 2.5 years, several initiatives we are actioning will also result in longer-term cost savings. Here based on our current analysis, we're looking at an additional ZAR 1 billion in annual sustainable savings from FY '18.\r\nNext to Slide 10. Several core levers underpin our 30-month Response Plan. These levers are summarized on the screen, on your slide, reflecting the individual ranges which equate to the ZAR 30 billion to ZAR 50 billion cumulative target. \r\nLooking at each of the levers in more detail. Turning first to cash cost savings. Here we've identified an extensive list of activities which will deliver ZAR 4 billion to ZAR 7 billion. These activities include corporate policies relating to remuneration, travel, entertainment, professional services and a broad category of discretionary spend items. And further optimizing our top and senior management layers of the company, we are looking at reducing our headcount by another 200 senior management personnel. \r\nNext, with a target of ZAR 5 billion to ZAR 9 billion through our gross margin and working capital lever, we are driving margin and efficiency improvements, we're also optimizing our account receivable balances and inventory on hand. Turning to the capital structuring, as mentioned earlier, our board confirmed a change in our dividend policy based on our cover range. We're also considering other opportunities in this area, which has allowed us to set a target range of ZAR 8 billion to ZAR 12 billion. \r\nTo our final lever, in January, we announced that we are rightsizing our capital portfolio, given uncertain external factors. As a result of this exercise, we decided to delay the final investment decision on our gas-to-liquids plant in the U.S.A. We're also reprioritizing our other growth and sustenance capital projects, here our target range is ZAR 13 billion to ZAR 22 billion in the next 30 months.\r\nI'll now hand it over to Paul, who will unpack our results in a little more detail for you. Paul?\n\n---\n\nThanks, David. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'm pleased to present you 2015 half year-end results to you today which are, obviously, in our guided earnings range provided for in our trading [ph] statement. We continued to deliver an overall strong operational and cost performance, despite a highly volatile macroeconomic environment as signaled by the 19% decrease in crude oil prices for the period under review. \r\nBefore moving to the details of the results, I would like to emphasize the following. First, management's continued focus on factors within our control has resulted in a strong operational performance, with overall increased volumes, cost-containment and margin improvement despite a very challenging operating environment. \r\nSecond, we have made significant progress on reducing our cost base through our Business Performance Enhancement Program and have increased the target to deliver at least ZAR 4.3 billion in sustainable cost savings by the end of the 2016 financial year. And finally, mitigating the challenges of the low oil price and continuing to deliver maximum sustainable value to our shareholders remains one of our top priorities. \r\nMoving to Slide 12. The macroeconomic environment driven by the significant decline in crude oil prices remains subdued and uncertain, with tough trading conditions expected to continue in the following 2 years. We are expecting a lower-for-longer oil price environment and as David has indicated, we have taken decisive actions to minimize the impact on our business. The average rand/U.S. dollar exchange rate was 9% weaker, with a 19% lower being crude oil price. Chemical prices and margins, on the other hand, have been much more resilient during the period under review.\r\nThe solvents [ph]  business, however, remained sensitive to significant movement in the rand/dollar exchange rate and oil prices and we do remind you about sensitivities to each of these variables. We estimate that the ZAR 0.10 in the annual average rand/U.S. dollar exchange rate and a $1 change in the crude oil price will affect our profits from global operations by approximately ZAR 605 million and ZAR 800 million, respectively.\r\nMoving to Slide 13. As mentioned previously, our new operating model as well as the simplified legal structure came into effect on the 1st of July, 2014. The results presented today reflect a performance of our 6 reportable business segments organized along an integrated value chain. For further details on the new segmental reporting, I refer you to the detailed [indiscernible] announcement as well as the supplementary information, that we publish on our website since November of last year. \r\nOverall, the group delivered a strong operational performance as result of increased sales volumes and improved margins in our performance chemicals and base chemicals' strategic business units, and increased sales volumes in our energy business unit. Headline earnings per share increased by 6% to ZAR 32 per share. Profit from operations of ZAR 30 billion was up 39%. This increase was positively impacted by once-off items of ZAR 6.8 billion, driven by macroeconomic factors, changes to the share price and our decision to operationalize our 2050 strategy. \r\nFocusing on our value chain. Our operating business unit delivered an overall strong performance, driven largely by stellar production performance from mining. In our strategic business unit, the energy business unit was impacted by the lower oil price, however, through focused management interventions the business increased liquid sales volumes by 3%, and reported high refining margins on the back of strong product differentials. \r\nTurning to our international energy portfolio. ORYX GTL delivered a solid operational performance, with an average utilization rate of 91% for the period despite a earlier-than-planned shutdown during December 2014. In our chemicals businesses both improved volumes as well as resilient margins boosted profitability, contributing 44% to the group's profit. \r\nMoving to Slide 14. The weaker rand/dollar exchange rate increased profitability by 12% and that benefit was however, overshadowed by the lower oil price which adversely affected profit by 20%. Profit from operations increased by 54% as a result of the following once-off items and period-end adjustments: a ZAR 3.7 billion lower share-based payment charge, following a 32% decrease in our share price over the last 6 months; lower depreciation and rehabilitation charges of ZAR 2.5 billion, due to the change in the useful life of our African assets in accordance with our 2050 strategy; and lastly, lower remeasurement items of ZAR 171 million complete through the ZAR 5.7 billion in the prior period, mainly due to the ZAR 5.3 billion Canadian impairment booked during the first half of financial year '14. High depreciation charges in respect of new plants as well as inflation of costs adversely affected profitability by 13%. \r\nWe are pleased to report a 6% increase in the sales volumes across the group. This is on the back of a 7% increase in sales volumes reported for the comparative period. The total increases in sales volumes of 13% over the last 2 years amounts to ZAR 7 billion in real terms.\r\nMoving to slide 15. We are extremely pleased with our continued cost performance. The increase in normalized cash fixed cost have been contained to 0.7%, below the South African producer price inflation of 6.8% for the first half of the 2015 financial year. Our cost savings mindset of driving sustainable cost reduction, in the group, delivered this strong performance, this, despite the cost pressures arriving from the South African cost environment in respect of labor, maintenance and electricity costs. \r\nIn addition, sustainable savings from our Business Performance Enhancement Program for the first 6 months amounted to ZAR 991 million, while cash implementation costs of the Business Performance Enhancement Program as well as growth costs added a further 6.9% savings to the total cash fixed cost.\r\nOverall, we benefited from a weaker rand/dollar exchange rate but the impact of the weaker rand added a further 1.5% to the total cash fixed cost price. Lower maintenance and energy remains the main drivers of cost base, with labor comprising, now approximately, 55% of our total cash fixed cost base.\r\nOur strategy to control energy costs has seen us maintain our electricity generating capacity in South Africa to around 70% of our own requirement. We expect electricity cost inflation to be in the double-digits, again, in the forthcoming financial year.\r\nFinally, cost reduction continues to be one of the critical focus areas for management. And through our Business Performance Enhancement Program and our recently launched Response Plan, we aim to be deriving cost streams in a safe and sustainable manner. \r\nMoving on to Slide 16. Focusing on our operating business units, minings profit from operations increased by 66%, mainly on the back of a 5% increase in production volumes. The benefits of our Business Performance Enhancement Program coupled with further operations flexibility created by the mine-replacement program, resulted in unit costs from our operations being contained to well below inflation, the first time since 2010. \r\nExploration and production in international reported a loss from operations of ZAR 1.7 billion. Our Mozambican operations were positively impacted by favorable gas prices, while volumes remained at similar levels compared to the prior period. We are progressing well with our current programs in Mozambique and further updates will be provided to the markets once confirmed. In Gabon, our assets were under pressure due to the decline in oil prices and the unfortunate selling of wells, which resulted in a partial impairment of ZAR 1.3 billion. In Nigeria, we relinquished our exploration licenses and incurred a loss of ZAR 565 million. \r\nOur Canadian upstream assets generated a loss from operations of ZAR 584 million, mainly due to the lower gas prices as well as reduced drilling activities. The 91% improvement in a loss from operations was mainly due to the lower depreciation and operational costs as well as a ZAR 5.3 billion impairment recognized in the period, in the prior period. We continue to execute on improved development plan in conjunction with our joint venture partner Progress Energy, and are derisking the assets with specific emphasis on the Cypress A acreage.\r\nMoving to Slide 17. Underpinned by an overall strong production volumes, our energy business delivered a pleasing set of results with Secunda Synfuels and Natref increasing production by 2% and 6%, respectively. Our Southern African energy portfolio was adversely impacted by the increased cost of production as well as reduction in basic fuel prices, which resulted in an 18% lower gross margin. \r\nOur Business Performance Enhancement Program however, continues to deliver results in all facets of our business, and we expect normalized cash cost per unit for the full year to be below SA PPI. Our ORYX GTL joint venture delivered a solid performance despite the earlier-than-planned shutdown. Our share of the profit from the joint venture decreased ZAR to 1.3 billion, mainly due to the shutdown and the oil prices. The plant achieved 91% utilization rate, which is ahead of the previous guidance provided. \r\nMoving to Slide 18. We have continued to see an increase in sales volumes and margin resilience in our chemicals business. The base chemicals' SBU delivered a pleasing performance of increasing profit from operations by 42%. Our chemicals basket dollar prices have declined by 5% in comparison with a 19% decline in average Brent crude oil prices. \r\nHowever, sales volumes normalized for sale of the Solvents Germany and Middle East polymer marketing operations increased by 1%. This business also benefited from the impact of the extension of the useful life of assets in South Africa, amounting to ZAR 899 million. \r\nThe performance chemicals SBU recorded another exceptional performance, underpinned by consistent and reliable operation delivery and a weaker rand. Profits from operations increased by 60% to ZAR 7.4 billion whilst operating margins expanded by 6% to 19%. Sales volumes increased by 5% due to improved production output on the back of high demand. \r\nOur U.S. business is still realizing healthy margins despite the decrease in sales prices. Our European operations continued to report improved volumes coupled with resilient margins. In our South African operations, we recognized a partial impairment reversal of ZAR 1.3 billion of the Wax Expansion Project, as a result of the impact of weaker rand exchange rate as well as the decision to extend the useful life of the plant beyond 2029. \r\nMoving to Slide 19. I would like to extend on what David touched on earlier, in respect of our Business Performance Enhancement Program. We have increased our savings target and now expect to generate sustainable annual savings of at least ZAR 4.3 billion at the end of the 2016 financial year. We have achieved actual year-to-date savings of ZAR 991 million and expect to save ZAR 1.5 billion in savings for the 2015 financial year. This represents an annualized run rate of about ZAR 2.2 billion. \r\nProject implementation cost of ZAR 1.5 billion were incurred for the 6 months to date and I expect it to peak at approximately ZAR 2.1 billion at the end of our 2015 financial year, before tapering off in the 2016 financial year as the project reaches its final phases of implementation. We then expect cash fixed costs to follow inflation from the 2017 financial year. \r\nAs David mentioned earlier, through our various Response Plan activities, we plan to deliver further sustainable cost savings of ZAR 1 billion as from financial year 2018. This is in addition to the business performance enhancement savings of at least ZAR 4.3 billion by financial year 2016. \r\nMoving on to Slide 20. Taking various factors into account, including overall market conditions, the group's financial position, capital investment plans as well as earnings growth an interim dividend of ZAR 7 per share has been declared. As part of the capital structuring lever in Response Plan, the management team and the Sasol Board of Directors have evaluated and changed the company's progressive dividend policy.\r\nThe revised policy is based on a dividend cover range of a corridor of between 2.2x and 2.8x of headline earnings per share. Our objective, considering the factors mentioned earlier, is to maintain a 40:60 interim to final dividend split. This policy, together with other components of the Response Plan, will provide sufficient flexibility for the company to manage its balance sheet, execute on its growth program, while continue to return maximum sustainable value to our shareholders through dividend payouts.\r\nMoving to Slide 21. Another critical lever of Response Plan is the reprioritization of our capital portfolio. We have revised our 2015 capital expenditure down from ZAR 50 billion to ZAR 45 billion. Our 2016 capital estimate will remain at ZAR 65 billion. This estimate, however, negates a ZAR 4 billion impact of the weakening rand on our capital portfolio. A further ZAR 8 billion to ZAR 13 billion in capital reduction is planned for the 2017 financial year. \r\nEven though we are reducing capital and other costs, I would like to emphasize that safe, reliable and sustainable operations are non-negotiable, and that management will continue to drive world-class safety practices across all operations. It's also important to note that critical and strategic growth projects in North America and Southern Africa will continue, as we evaluate new opportunity for further growth.\r\nTurning to Slide 22. We continued to focus on the factors within our control, that being volume growth, margin enhancement and cost reduction. We expect an overall strong production performance for the remainder of the 2015 financial year. \r\nTotal South African liquid fuel sales volumes are expected to be around 59 million barrels for the year. We expect ORYX GTL's average utilization rate to continue to be above 90%. Our chemicals business will keep on driving improved volumes and margin enhancement. Base chemicals normal sales volumes are expected to be slightly higher than the financial year '14, with margins coming under some pressure during the second half of the financial area compared to the first half of the financial year. \r\nAnd performance chemicals sales volumes are expected to outperform financial year '14 with increased market demand coupled with resilient margins. We expect normalized cash fixed costs to follow inflation; the Response Plan's cash contribution to range between ZAR 6 billion and ZAR 10 billion for financial year '15; and the average of Brent crude oil prices to be at least 30% lower in the second half of this financial year compared to the first half of the financial year.\r\nAnd on that note, I hand back to David.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Paul. And to reach our overarching goal of delivering shareholder value sustainably, it's important that we maintain focus on our dual regional strategy here in Southern Africa and North America. This approach complements our other important business activities in Eurasia, the Middle East and the rest of Africa. \r\nLooking at the U.S. specifically and turning to Slide 24. We're proceeding with the construction of our ZAR 8.9 billion ethane cracker and derivatives complex in Louisiana and as all of you know, in December 2014, we established a $4 billion credit facility which will be used to finance the project. We've already secured 80% of the funds required through a combination of project finance and our own equity contributions.\r\nThe robust project economics benefited from an advantaged site location, which expands on our existing operations, economies of scale, and improved our cost structure and upgraded infrastructure and utilities which drive further efficiencies. \r\nThe new cracker complex would roughly triple the capacity of the Lake Charles site. Furthermore, our product slate distinguishes our investment for most of the other crackers that have been announced. Our project combines commodity and specialty products which will leverage low-cost U.S. ethane feedstocks, and note that specialty chemicals produce will deliver high-value returns even if chemical markets fluctuate. \r\nTo oversee the execution phases of projects, we have an extremely experienced owners team in place and have progressed several key milestones. Site work is proceeding safely and efficiently and we expect that the plan will achieve mechanical completion at the end of calendar year 2017, beneficial operations is on track for the first half of calendar year 2018. \r\nSlide 25 summarizes our broader contributions in Southern Africa. This slide is self-explanatory, so let me just make a few general comments here on air quality and carbon emissions. Now responsible operations is at the heart of our corporate commitments and to ensure our ongoing compliance with new air quality regulations in South Africa, we applied for certain postponements to manage our short-term challenges relating to the compliance time frames. \r\nWe have now received decisions on our postponement applications from the National Air Quality Officer which, while aligned with our requests, imposed some stretched targets. Our focus is now in the alignment of our licenses to reflect these postponement decisions and on implementing our air quality emission reduction road maps, including community-based offsets to substantially improved ambient air quality where we operate.\r\nAs an important aside, it is a given that increasing South Africa's investment attractiveness and alleviating the current electricity crisis are top priorities for the government. It therefore remains our position that the implementation of a carbon tax, any time in the foreseeable future, would be ill advised and instead add a further cost burden to the economy. \r\nAt the same time, we are concerned that the proposed carbon tax will diminish South Africa's international competitiveness and result in a range of other unintended consequences. In our view, the country needs appropriate incentives to invest in new, more energy-efficient processes and projects that improve our energy security and lower our greenhouse gas emissions. \r\nLooking at the final slide, Slide 26. In order to build on our successes, whatever the global circumstances, we are focusing on enhancing our existing assets and on driving selective growth opportunities. \r\nIn 2011, we undertook to get operational basics right. Today, our ZAR 14 billion Secunda growth program is nearing completion with volume and electricity benefits now fully realized. Group-wide, we continue to generate improved volumes from our global operations. Our Business Performance Enhancement Program is also delivering results with simplified company-wide structures, reduced management layers and costs contained within inflation. \r\nIn South Africa, specifically, we've embarked on an extensive 2050 strategy to ensure the efficiency and reliability of our in-country operations to the middle of the century. Looking at our selective growth opportunities, our dual-regional strategy remains compelling. In America, our Lake Charles Chemicals Project is advancing, while in Southern Africa, we submitted our full field development plan for the Production Sharing Agreement to the Mozambican authorities on February 25. \r\nAlso in Mozambique, our 175-megawatt gas-fired power plant is ramping up nicely. Once fully operational, the plant will supply electricity to more than 2 million Mozambicans, which equates to 8% of the country's current demand. Here in South Africa, the expansion of our Wax facility in Sasolburg is progressing well, with phase 1 commissioning of the new slurry bed reactor scheduled for the first half of this calendar year. Phase 2 beneficial operation's on track for the first half of calendar year 2017. \r\nAs you can see from this slide, both our existing asset and selective growth pillars are now underpinned by our Response Plan, thereby serving to create more value. Here, our prioritized plan, supported by a solid balance sheet, underpin our flexible dividend policy based on a cover range. \r\nIn the half year, we continued to deliver an overall, strong operational and cost performance. With oil prices moving dramatically lower over the last 6 months, the management team has formulated a comprehensive Response Plan to conserve cash and further refine our organizational structures and near-term strategies. The benefits of the detailed work we're doing now will ensure that Sasol emerges from the current challenging macroeconomic environment as an even leaner and more-focused business. With that, we'd now be happy to open it up for any questions you may have. Operator?",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nThanks very much, operator, and good day, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our interim results conference call today. Joining me here in Johannesburg from Sasol are Bongani Nqwababa, our new Chief Financial Officer, who started at Sasol on March 1. A warm welcome to Bongani. Also on the call is Paul Victor, who has been an outstanding and extremely dedicated acting Chief Financial Officer, who will support me on today's call. We also have with us other members of the Sasol group executive committee, who will support us and respond to any questions you may have.\r\nAs you would have seen, today, we announced a resilient group-wide performance, notwithstanding an extremely tough macroeconomic environment, despite the implementation of a major corporate restructuring, our colleagues throughout the world have maintained their focus on safety, volume growth, increased sales in key strategic projects.\r\nTurning to Slide 4 in the pack. We'll cover the following key messages today: I'll begin by providing you with a high-level overview of how our optimized operating model is providing Sasol a solid platform to weather even the most severe of storms; next, we'll spend some time reviewing our key performance achievements during the first half of the 2015 financial year; I'll then provide you with an update on one of our most important initiatives, our Business Performance Enhancement Program. \r\nOf course, it's clear that the current crude oil price presents challenging times for us. Instrumental to our ability to ride out the storm and maintain our momentum is our response to the low oil price environment.\r\nIn December, the management team launched our oil price Response Plan. Today, we'll update you on the cash conservation levers we are actioning as part of this plan. Paul will then go into more detail on our financial and operational performance.\r\nBefore wrapping up, I'll talk you through the advancements we've been making on our dual regional strategic, primarily focusing on our Lake Charles Chemicals Project in the U.S. And we'll conclude this morning's session by recapping how Sasol continues to create value by proactively prioritizing our business activities.\r\nMoving on to slide 5. On July 1, we implemented a completely revamped operating model. 8 months down the track, we definitely see us gaining traction and delivering results. Our new operating model aligns operating business units, regional operating hubs, strategic business units and group functions into an integrated value chain, producing liquid fuels, high-value chemicals and low carbon electricity.\r\nHaving implemented our new model at the start of this financial year, we also updated our financial reporting according to the new reportable segments. This slide summarizes the key operating model benefits, which you will be familiar with so I will not go into any further detail here. \r\nHowever, one important takeaway is that through our internal consolidation and rightsizing, we've radically streamlined our management layers. In fact, since 2013, we have reduced our top management layer by 61%. This reduction was brought about by more efficient reporting lines and by maximizing economies of scale.\r\nNext is Slide 6. And looking at our interim results, we have solid contributions across the value chain. In addition, our group safety recordable case rate, excluding illnesses, improved to 0.32, down appreciably from 0.36 at the start of the financial year. \r\nTurning to our sales volumes. Performance chemicals were up 5%, base chemicals normalized sales volumes were up 1%, and liquid fuels sales in our energy business in Southern Africa were up 3%. Through determined management action, our normalized cash fixed costs have continued trend below inflation at 6.1% versus the South African PPI of 6.8% for the half year. \r\nOver the period, headline earnings per share were up 6% to ZAR 32 per share and earnings per share increased by 53% to ZAR 32.04. The half year had a number once-off items which, for the most part, impacted our performance positively and Paul will explain the items further in just a few minutes. \r\nWith significantly lower oil prices, the management team and the board revisited our group's dividend policy. Last month, we moved away from a progressive dividend to a dividend cover range based on headline earnings per share. As a result, the company has declared an interim dividend of ZAR 7 per share for the first half of FY '15, not dissimilar to last year's record interim dividend of ZAR 8 per share.\r\nTurning to Slide 7. In the context of our large-scale change program, which commenced in 2011, we refined our corporate strategy, streamlined our management structures, we adapted our systems and processes and drove a comprehensive Business Performance Enhancement Program. Today, as we navigate our way through a challenging global reality, it's reassuring to know that at Sasol we have been fixing the roof while the sun was shining. As a result and with our company redesign fully implemented, we are much better equipped to deal with any challenge.\r\nLooking at some of the specific details of our enhancement program. By December 31, we'd signed off on approximately 1,500 employment separations, either through voluntary retrenchments or early retirements; we implemented a group-wide vacancy freeze and a hiring moratorium, which today are both delivering additional benefits to our cost optimization endeavors.\r\nAs a result of our intensified efforts, we have increased our program target from at least ZAR 4 billion in annual savings to ZAR 4.3 billion at the end of FY '16. If we look at our sustainable savings to date, we are sitting at ZAR 1 billion annually with restructuring charges of approximately ZAR 1.5 billion. However, in the context of a lower-for-longer oil scenario, our change program efforts, although significant, are not sufficient. If we consider the views of external experts and the prevailing market sentiment, far more has to be done. \r\nTurning next to the graph on Slide 8. Over the past several months, we've seen a sharp decline in the average Brent crude oil price. This has had a severe knock-on effect on everyone in or affiliated with the oil industry. Forecasting the oil price trajectory remains challenging as the market is still in the process of determining a new short-term equilibrium price. Equally difficult is predicting when supply and demand will become more balanced, in parallel, storage constraints and geopolitical tensions must also be considered.\r\nWhat we know for certain is that current oil prices are too low to sustain drilling programs or to provide incentives for new upstream investments. Companies within this sector is substantially reducing their capital requirements and cutting exploration budgets.\r\nAs is the case with our industry peers, we too are hampered by what many external experts expect to be a lower-for-longer oil scenario, until at least mid-2016. In the longer term, the rebalancing of the supply-demand market will require additional volumes to replace global oil production declines coupled with demand growth. This is evident from the oval shading in the graph, which indicates the recovery to $80 dollars per barrel in FY '17. So today's outlook is quite different to how we viewed the world only a few months ago. As a result, in December 2014, we proactively formulated a comprehensive plan to protect cash in response to these oil-price uncertainties. \r\nMoving on to slide 9 come, having done considerable legwork, our Response Plan caters for a cash conservation target range of between ZAR 30 billion to ZAR 50 billion over the next 30 months. In all the activities we are working on to protect cash, safe, reliable and efficient operations remain non-negotiable for us. Response Plan has flexible levers so that we can respond to the volatile macroeconomic environment, while optimizing our ultimate profitability over the long term.\r\nThe cash conservation levers we have formulated under the Response Plan are over and above the Business Performance Enhancement Program savings targets. And while our Response Plan protects cash over a relatively short period, the next 2.5 years, several initiatives we are actioning will also result in longer-term cost savings. Here based on our current analysis, we're looking at an additional ZAR 1 billion in annual sustainable savings from FY '18.\r\nNext to Slide 10. Several core levers underpin our 30-month Response Plan. These levers are summarized on the screen, on your slide, reflecting the individual ranges which equate to the ZAR 30 billion to ZAR 50 billion cumulative target. \r\nLooking at each of the levers in more detail. Turning first to cash cost savings. Here we've identified an extensive list of activities which will deliver ZAR 4 billion to ZAR 7 billion. These activities include corporate policies relating to remuneration, travel, entertainment, professional services and a broad category of discretionary spend items. And further optimizing our top and senior management layers of the company, we are looking at reducing our headcount by another 200 senior management personnel. \r\nNext, with a target of ZAR 5 billion to ZAR 9 billion through our gross margin and working capital lever, we are driving margin and efficiency improvements, we're also optimizing our account receivable balances and inventory on hand. Turning to the capital structuring, as mentioned earlier, our board confirmed a change in our dividend policy based on our cover range. We're also considering other opportunities in this area, which has allowed us to set a target range of ZAR 8 billion to ZAR 12 billion. \r\nTo our final lever, in January, we announced that we are rightsizing our capital portfolio, given uncertain external factors. As a result of this exercise, we decided to delay the final investment decision on our gas-to-liquids plant in the U.S.A. We're also reprioritizing our other growth and sustenance capital projects, here our target range is ZAR 13 billion to ZAR 22 billion in the next 30 months.\r\nI'll now hand it over to Paul, who will unpack our results in a little more detail for you. Paul?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Paul Victor (Executives)】\nThanks, David. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'm pleased to present you 2015 half year-end results to you today which are, obviously, in our guided earnings range provided for in our trading [ph] statement. We continued to deliver an overall strong operational and cost performance, despite a highly volatile macroeconomic environment as signaled by the 19% decrease in crude oil prices for the period under review. \r\nBefore moving to the details of the results, I would like to emphasize the following. First, management's continued focus on factors within our control has resulted in a strong operational performance, with overall increased volumes, cost-containment and margin improvement despite a very challenging operating environment. \r\nSecond, we have made significant progress on reducing our cost base through our Business Performance Enhancement Program and have increased the target to deliver at least ZAR 4.3 billion in sustainable cost savings by the end of the 2016 financial year. And finally, mitigating the challenges of the low oil price and continuing to deliver maximum sustainable value to our shareholders remains one of our top priorities. \r\nMoving to Slide 12. The macroeconomic environment driven by the significant decline in crude oil prices remains subdued and uncertain, with tough trading conditions expected to continue in the following 2 years. We are expecting a lower-for-longer oil price environment and as David has indicated, we have taken decisive actions to minimize the impact on our business. The average rand/U.S. dollar exchange rate was 9% weaker, with a 19% lower being crude oil price. Chemical prices and margins, on the other hand, have been much more resilient during the period under review.\r\nThe solvents [ph]  business, however, remained sensitive to significant movement in the rand/dollar exchange rate and oil prices and we do remind you about sensitivities to each of these variables. We estimate that the ZAR 0.10 in the annual average rand/U.S. dollar exchange rate and a $1 change in the crude oil price will affect our profits from global operations by approximately ZAR 605 million and ZAR 800 million, respectively.\r\nMoving to Slide 13. As mentioned previously, our new operating model as well as the simplified legal structure came into effect on the 1st of July, 2014. The results presented today reflect a performance of our 6 reportable business segments organized along an integrated value chain. For further details on the new segmental reporting, I refer you to the detailed [indiscernible] announcement as well as the supplementary information, that we publish on our website since November of last year. \r\nOverall, the group delivered a strong operational performance as result of increased sales volumes and improved margins in our performance chemicals and base chemicals' strategic business units, and increased sales volumes in our energy business unit. Headline earnings per share increased by 6% to ZAR 32 per share. Profit from operations of ZAR 30 billion was up 39%. This increase was positively impacted by once-off items of ZAR 6.8 billion, driven by macroeconomic factors, changes to the share price and our decision to operationalize our 2050 strategy. \r\nFocusing on our value chain. Our operating business unit delivered an overall strong performance, driven largely by stellar production performance from mining. In our strategic business unit, the energy business unit was impacted by the lower oil price, however, through focused management interventions the business increased liquid sales volumes by 3%, and reported high refining margins on the back of strong product differentials. \r\nTurning to our international energy portfolio. ORYX GTL delivered a solid operational performance, with an average utilization rate of 91% for the period despite a earlier-than-planned shutdown during December 2014. In our chemicals businesses both improved volumes as well as resilient margins boosted profitability, contributing 44% to the group's profit. \r\nMoving to Slide 14. The weaker rand/dollar exchange rate increased profitability by 12% and that benefit was however, overshadowed by the lower oil price which adversely affected profit by 20%. Profit from operations increased by 54% as a result of the following once-off items and period-end adjustments: a ZAR 3.7 billion lower share-based payment charge, following a 32% decrease in our share price over the last 6 months; lower depreciation and rehabilitation charges of ZAR 2.5 billion, due to the change in the useful life of our African assets in accordance with our 2050 strategy; and lastly, lower remeasurement items of ZAR 171 million complete through the ZAR 5.7 billion in the prior period, mainly due to the ZAR 5.3 billion Canadian impairment booked during the first half of financial year '14. High depreciation charges in respect of new plants as well as inflation of costs adversely affected profitability by 13%. \r\nWe are pleased to report a 6% increase in the sales volumes across the group. This is on the back of a 7% increase in sales volumes reported for the comparative period. The total increases in sales volumes of 13% over the last 2 years amounts to ZAR 7 billion in real terms.\r\nMoving to slide 15. We are extremely pleased with our continued cost performance. The increase in normalized cash fixed cost have been contained to 0.7%, below the South African producer price inflation of 6.8% for the first half of the 2015 financial year. Our cost savings mindset of driving sustainable cost reduction, in the group, delivered this strong performance, this, despite the cost pressures arriving from the South African cost environment in respect of labor, maintenance and electricity costs. \r\nIn addition, sustainable savings from our Business Performance Enhancement Program for the first 6 months amounted to ZAR 991 million, while cash implementation costs of the Business Performance Enhancement Program as well as growth costs added a further 6.9% savings to the total cash fixed cost.\r\nOverall, we benefited from a weaker rand/dollar exchange rate but the impact of the weaker rand added a further 1.5% to the total cash fixed cost price. Lower maintenance and energy remains the main drivers of cost base, with labor comprising, now approximately, 55% of our total cash fixed cost base.\r\nOur strategy to control energy costs has seen us maintain our electricity generating capacity in South Africa to around 70% of our own requirement. We expect electricity cost inflation to be in the double-digits, again, in the forthcoming financial year.\r\nFinally, cost reduction continues to be one of the critical focus areas for management. And through our Business Performance Enhancement Program and our recently launched Response Plan, we aim to be deriving cost streams in a safe and sustainable manner. \r\nMoving on to Slide 16. Focusing on our operating business units, minings profit from operations increased by 66%, mainly on the back of a 5% increase in production volumes. The benefits of our Business Performance Enhancement Program coupled with further operations flexibility created by the mine-replacement program, resulted in unit costs from our operations being contained to well below inflation, the first time since 2010. \r\nExploration and production in international reported a loss from operations of ZAR 1.7 billion. Our Mozambican operations were positively impacted by favorable gas prices, while volumes remained at similar levels compared to the prior period. We are progressing well with our current programs in Mozambique and further updates will be provided to the markets once confirmed. In Gabon, our assets were under pressure due to the decline in oil prices and the unfortunate selling of wells, which resulted in a partial impairment of ZAR 1.3 billion. In Nigeria, we relinquished our exploration licenses and incurred a loss of ZAR 565 million. \r\nOur Canadian upstream assets generated a loss from operations of ZAR 584 million, mainly due to the lower gas prices as well as reduced drilling activities. The 91% improvement in a loss from operations was mainly due to the lower depreciation and operational costs as well as a ZAR 5.3 billion impairment recognized in the period, in the prior period. We continue to execute on improved development plan in conjunction with our joint venture partner Progress Energy, and are derisking the assets with specific emphasis on the Cypress A acreage.\r\nMoving to Slide 17. Underpinned by an overall strong production volumes, our energy business delivered a pleasing set of results with Secunda Synfuels and Natref increasing production by 2% and 6%, respectively. Our Southern African energy portfolio was adversely impacted by the increased cost of production as well as reduction in basic fuel prices, which resulted in an 18% lower gross margin. \r\nOur Business Performance Enhancement Program however, continues to deliver results in all facets of our business, and we expect normalized cash cost per unit for the full year to be below SA PPI. Our ORYX GTL joint venture delivered a solid performance despite the earlier-than-planned shutdown. Our share of the profit from the joint venture decreased ZAR to 1.3 billion, mainly due to the shutdown and the oil prices. The plant achieved 91% utilization rate, which is ahead of the previous guidance provided. \r\nMoving to Slide 18. We have continued to see an increase in sales volumes and margin resilience in our chemicals business. The base chemicals' SBU delivered a pleasing performance of increasing profit from operations by 42%. Our chemicals basket dollar prices have declined by 5% in comparison with a 19% decline in average Brent crude oil prices. \r\nHowever, sales volumes normalized for sale of the Solvents Germany and Middle East polymer marketing operations increased by 1%. This business also benefited from the impact of the extension of the useful life of assets in South Africa, amounting to ZAR 899 million. \r\nThe performance chemicals SBU recorded another exceptional performance, underpinned by consistent and reliable operation delivery and a weaker rand. Profits from operations increased by 60% to ZAR 7.4 billion whilst operating margins expanded by 6% to 19%. Sales volumes increased by 5% due to improved production output on the back of high demand. \r\nOur U.S. business is still realizing healthy margins despite the decrease in sales prices. Our European operations continued to report improved volumes coupled with resilient margins. In our South African operations, we recognized a partial impairment reversal of ZAR 1.3 billion of the Wax Expansion Project, as a result of the impact of weaker rand exchange rate as well as the decision to extend the useful life of the plant beyond 2029. \r\nMoving to Slide 19. I would like to extend on what David touched on earlier, in respect of our Business Performance Enhancement Program. We have increased our savings target and now expect to generate sustainable annual savings of at least ZAR 4.3 billion at the end of the 2016 financial year. We have achieved actual year-to-date savings of ZAR 991 million and expect to save ZAR 1.5 billion in savings for the 2015 financial year. This represents an annualized run rate of about ZAR 2.2 billion. \r\nProject implementation cost of ZAR 1.5 billion were incurred for the 6 months to date and I expect it to peak at approximately ZAR 2.1 billion at the end of our 2015 financial year, before tapering off in the 2016 financial year as the project reaches its final phases of implementation. We then expect cash fixed costs to follow inflation from the 2017 financial year. \r\nAs David mentioned earlier, through our various Response Plan activities, we plan to deliver further sustainable cost savings of ZAR 1 billion as from financial year 2018. This is in addition to the business performance enhancement savings of at least ZAR 4.3 billion by financial year 2016. \r\nMoving on to Slide 20. Taking various factors into account, including overall market conditions, the group's financial position, capital investment plans as well as earnings growth an interim dividend of ZAR 7 per share has been declared. As part of the capital structuring lever in Response Plan, the management team and the Sasol Board of Directors have evaluated and changed the company's progressive dividend policy.\r\nThe revised policy is based on a dividend cover range of a corridor of between 2.2x and 2.8x of headline earnings per share. Our objective, considering the factors mentioned earlier, is to maintain a 40:60 interim to final dividend split. This policy, together with other components of the Response Plan, will provide sufficient flexibility for the company to manage its balance sheet, execute on its growth program, while continue to return maximum sustainable value to our shareholders through dividend payouts.\r\nMoving to Slide 21. Another critical lever of Response Plan is the reprioritization of our capital portfolio. We have revised our 2015 capital expenditure down from ZAR 50 billion to ZAR 45 billion. Our 2016 capital estimate will remain at ZAR 65 billion. This estimate, however, negates a ZAR 4 billion impact of the weakening rand on our capital portfolio. A further ZAR 8 billion to ZAR 13 billion in capital reduction is planned for the 2017 financial year. \r\nEven though we are reducing capital and other costs, I would like to emphasize that safe, reliable and sustainable operations are non-negotiable, and that management will continue to drive world-class safety practices across all operations. It's also important to note that critical and strategic growth projects in North America and Southern Africa will continue, as we evaluate new opportunity for further growth.\r\nTurning to Slide 22. We continued to focus on the factors within our control, that being volume growth, margin enhancement and cost reduction. We expect an overall strong production performance for the remainder of the 2015 financial year. \r\nTotal South African liquid fuel sales volumes are expected to be around 59 million barrels for the year. We expect ORYX GTL's average utilization rate to continue to be above 90%. Our chemicals business will keep on driving improved volumes and margin enhancement. Base chemicals normal sales volumes are expected to be slightly higher than the financial year '14, with margins coming under some pressure during the second half of the financial area compared to the first half of the financial year. \r\nAnd performance chemicals sales volumes are expected to outperform financial year '14 with increased market demand coupled with resilient margins. We expect normalized cash fixed costs to follow inflation; the Response Plan's cash contribution to range between ZAR 6 billion and ZAR 10 billion for financial year '15; and the average of Brent crude oil prices to be at least 30% lower in the second half of this financial year compared to the first half of the financial year.\r\nAnd on that note, I hand back to David.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nThank you, Paul. And to reach our overarching goal of delivering shareholder value sustainably, it's important that we maintain focus on our dual regional strategy here in Southern Africa and North America. This approach complements our other important business activities in Eurasia, the Middle East and the rest of Africa. \r\nLooking at the U.S. specifically and turning to Slide 24. We're proceeding with the construction of our ZAR 8.9 billion ethane cracker and derivatives complex in Louisiana and as all of you know, in December 2014, we established a $4 billion credit facility which will be used to finance the project. We've already secured 80% of the funds required through a combination of project finance and our own equity contributions.\r\nThe robust project economics benefited from an advantaged site location, which expands on our existing operations, economies of scale, and improved our cost structure and upgraded infrastructure and utilities which drive further efficiencies. \r\nThe new cracker complex would roughly triple the capacity of the Lake Charles site. Furthermore, our product slate distinguishes our investment for most of the other crackers that have been announced. Our project combines commodity and specialty products which will leverage low-cost U.S. ethane feedstocks, and note that specialty chemicals produce will deliver high-value returns even if chemical markets fluctuate. \r\nTo oversee the execution phases of projects, we have an extremely experienced owners team in place and have progressed several key milestones. Site work is proceeding safely and efficiently and we expect that the plan will achieve mechanical completion at the end of calendar year 2017, beneficial operations is on track for the first half of calendar year 2018. \r\nSlide 25 summarizes our broader contributions in Southern Africa. This slide is self-explanatory, so let me just make a few general comments here on air quality and carbon emissions. Now responsible operations is at the heart of our corporate commitments and to ensure our ongoing compliance with new air quality regulations in South Africa, we applied for certain postponements to manage our short-term challenges relating to the compliance time frames. \r\nWe have now received decisions on our postponement applications from the National Air Quality Officer which, while aligned with our requests, imposed some stretched targets. Our focus is now in the alignment of our licenses to reflect these postponement decisions and on implementing our air quality emission reduction road maps, including community-based offsets to substantially improved ambient air quality where we operate.\r\nAs an important aside, it is a given that increasing South Africa's investment attractiveness and alleviating the current electricity crisis are top priorities for the government. It therefore remains our position that the implementation of a carbon tax, any time in the foreseeable future, would be ill advised and instead add a further cost burden to the economy. \r\nAt the same time, we are concerned that the proposed carbon tax will diminish South Africa's international competitiveness and result in a range of other unintended consequences. In our view, the country needs appropriate incentives to invest in new, more energy-efficient processes and projects that improve our energy security and lower our greenhouse gas emissions. \r\nLooking at the final slide, Slide 26. In order to build on our successes, whatever the global circumstances, we are focusing on enhancing our existing assets and on driving selective growth opportunities. \r\nIn 2011, we undertook to get operational basics right. Today, our ZAR 14 billion Secunda growth program is nearing completion with volume and electricity benefits now fully realized. Group-wide, we continue to generate improved volumes from our global operations. Our Business Performance Enhancement Program is also delivering results with simplified company-wide structures, reduced management layers and costs contained within inflation. \r\nIn South Africa, specifically, we've embarked on an extensive 2050 strategy to ensure the efficiency and reliability of our in-country operations to the middle of the century. Looking at our selective growth opportunities, our dual-regional strategy remains compelling. In America, our Lake Charles Chemicals Project is advancing, while in Southern Africa, we submitted our full field development plan for the Production Sharing Agreement to the Mozambican authorities on February 25. \r\nAlso in Mozambique, our 175-megawatt gas-fired power plant is ramping up nicely. Once fully operational, the plant will supply electricity to more than 2 million Mozambicans, which equates to 8% of the country's current demand. Here in South Africa, the expansion of our Wax facility in Sasolburg is progressing well, with phase 1 commissioning of the new slurry bed reactor scheduled for the first half of this calendar year. Phase 2 beneficial operation's on track for the first half of calendar year 2017. \r\nAs you can see from this slide, both our existing asset and selective growth pillars are now underpinned by our Response Plan, thereby serving to create more value. Here, our prioritized plan, supported by a solid balance sheet, underpin our flexible dividend policy based on a cover range. \r\nIn the half year, we continued to deliver an overall, strong operational and cost performance. With oil prices moving dramatically lower over the last 6 months, the management team has formulated a comprehensive Response Plan to conserve cash and further refine our organizational structures and near-term strategies. The benefits of the detailed work we're doing now will ensure that Sasol emerges from the current challenging macroeconomic environment as an even leaner and more-focused business. With that, we'd now be happy to open it up for any questions you may have. Operator?",
      "transcript_text3": "On, Uzbekistan GTL, I've seen the detail that it used to be classified as an asset-for-sale and now has been brought back into use, based on the group's intention to further develop the asset, so could you give us some background on that? I see there's been a provision taken against that as well. And then, secondly, just on U.S. GTL. And I know the study costs clearly causes an impact on cash fixed cost to the energy business. How much has been spent on the U.S. GTL studies to date and how much was spent in the first half? And I see as well, in the detail, that land acquisitions in the U.S. continue for future projects, how much of that relates to U.S. GTL? And then just finally, you mentioned the Mozambique one-off social growth development cost of ZAR 443 million, could you just give a little bit of a flavor of what that entails?\n\n---\n\nCaroline, I'll kick off with Uzbek GTL and have Paul chime in on GTL study costs and land acquisition, we'll get to Mozambique as well. Uzbek GTL, as you know, we were sitting at 44.5% shareholding in that project, and looking to sell down and spread risk on the project down to 25.5%. Right now, we're looking at a revised business model, it has moved from held-for-sale back into in-use. And that business model that we're looking at would envision Sasol not spending anymore capital on the project, but looking at a business model where we would be licensing our technology, supplying catalysts to the project and providing technical services, including project management and technical support to get the project up and running, so that's where it stands right now. We're busy in negotiations, things look very positive from our perspective. A good -- like I said, a business model, we're working on, it looks very favorable to Sasol and gets us into licensing, which is something that has been an interest for us in that space as well. So that's GTL. U.S. GTL study -- that's Uzbek GTL, U.S. GLT study cost spend, to date is in the neighborhood of ZAR 300 million. But Paul, can you give us the details?\n\n---\n\nCaroline, so basically, if we look in terms of what we have spent thus far, in total, on the U.S. GTL is just over $300 million in total and then, obviously, not all of the costs one can capitalize so roughly ZAR 160 million of GTL study costs, that you cannot carry on your balance sheet. That really relates to business establishment type of cost and marketing cost that's ZAR 160 million, that will be the growth on the period-to-period, that's a portion that we could not capitalize and that we expense and you also see that as part of the cash fixed cost declaration and exploration [ph] in -- under the energy bucket. Focusing on the land, David can address the question. So ultimately -- and we also see that when we were overseas doing the visit in Lake Charles, is that there's 2 components of land. The first, basically is, the acquiring of the land and then also the voluntary purchase program that we have. Now in total, the land -- buying the land is going to cost us roughly $240 million, (sic) [ZAR 240 million] of which ZAR 120 million has been apportioned to the cracker and ZAR 120 million has been apportioned to the GTL. Of the $120 million (sic) [ZAR120 million] that's allocated to the GTL, we have spent $90 million (sic) [ZAR 90 million] thus far and ultimately, there's a remaining $50\r\n-- $50 million (sic) [ZAR 30 million] that still need to be spent. We do, however, plan to continue and acquire all the land, notwithstanding the fact that we have delayed the U.S. GTL decision.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Paul. And then the final, the Mozambican development funds that you are asking about. That is a downstream gas market development fund that we are contributing to -- through our partners in Mozambique to, hopefully, get additional downstream projects off the ground, which can obviously benefit our oil and gas development activities in the country. So that's where we're working with the international -- IFC and ENH partners to put that fund together and, like I say, help develop downstream gas markets in Mozambique.\n\n---\n\nI've also got about 3 questions, please. Just, firstly, on maintenance CapEx. I realize you say that your volumes are paramount. I just would like to know where -- exactly in which business units the maintenance CapEx savings seems to be coming through? And then, the second question just relates to the chemical volumes. So a good performance on chemicals, I just want to know if you can split this out of which -- what is the contribution from -- or positive contribution from EPU5 as well as the C3 stabilization plant and I suppose, operations in general, relative to market demand? And then the last question is just in addition to these additional ZAR 1 billion worth of cost savings, which you mentioned sustainable from 2018, I just want to understand the scope difference between this and Project Phoenix or is this just, more efficiently, coming out of Project Phoenix? And that's about it.\n\n---\n\nJarrett, I'll ask, on the first one, if Paul can talk about the maintenance CapEx savings, and then I'll talk about the chemicals volumes and then I think Paul's got the ZAR 1 billion answer as well. Go ahead, Paul.\n\n---\n\nGood. Jarrett, yes, so basically when we look in terms of the maintenance capital expenditure, we were, obviously, in our thinking a lot of non-negotiables, in terms of capping future cash savings from. So specifically, the shutdown in Secunda, the renewal program and, specifically, all the maintenance work on the GOs and the boilers and so forth that we haven't optimized. But there is a big portion of later, other sustenance capital projects that you'd look at across the value chain and where we've either delayed or stopped a project. So the whole value chain was however impacted by the reduction of the optimization of the sustenance spend and ultimately we have provided those ranges and then ultimately, certain non-negotiables, specifically, ensuring long-term sustainability, reliability and availability of the plant.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Paul. And Jarrett, you're exactly correct in chemicals volumes in, certainly, in polymers. EPU5, which has been up and running since last year now added an additional 47,000 tons annually and reduced flaring, I think we've talked about flaring that was reduced from 7% to 1% based on that installation. C3 stabilization reached beneficial operation in just at the very end of our last, this -- I guess, at the start of this financial year and added another 58,000 tons per year. So those are 2 key areas that we see coming through nicely in polymers. And then, keep an eye out for the C3 expansion which has beneficial operation in June of this year, with a capacity of a 105,000 tons per year. So those are -- those 2 existing and 1 coming on, shortly is -- will be very nice for the polymers or part of the base chemicals business. Paul, ZAR 1 billion on sustainable savings Response Plan FY '18?\n\n---\n\nSo the question is on the sustainability and whether it is just a further extension of the Project Phoenix. We don't see it, we really drive the Response Plan as a additional project in our business. In terms of looking at the sustainability, yes, from a clean perspective it's actually levering further efficiency improvement in our overall cash cost base. So while Project Phoenix is very much focused on cash fixed cost base and limited to other cash cost, the Response Plan is actually looking at the overall cash cost base, which really opened up, let's say, the size of the prize a bit more. In terms of the general things that we are looking for we are further optimizing our structures, as we previously communicated, through the consolidation of international energy, our South African Energy is one example. We also saw in our syns [ph] Announcement, we're also levering -- not filling, certain noncritical vacancies and we plan to see whether we can actually continue with those or that right-staff establishment going forward. David also spoke about the 200 managerial staff that we further optimized, as a result of the new Response Plan, and then, generally, we're also looking quite differently at our supply chain and also renegotiating contracts, we'd say, quite more diligently as part of this process in order to save cash costs on a sustainable basis. So definitely, the theme is on much more efficiency but taking a little bit more focus on a wider cost bucket as opposed to Project Phoenix.\n\n---\n\nThanks Paul. We'll take the next question.\n\n---\n\nJust got a few questions. On -- Firstly, on -- you extended the life of your plants...\n\n---\n\nSorry, Alex. Operator, we can't hear the question.\n\n---\n\nCan you hear me?\n\n---\n\nTry again. That's a little better.\n\n---\n\nYes, you extended the life of your plant to 2015 and that helped these journeys a little bit. I was just wondering, what -- did you include any sort of, carbon tax in your assumption, when you did that, given that, if you look at the IAS and very, sort of, significant carbon costs going forward? So the first question. Secondly, historically, you've given out a U.S. profit. So I would assume that the port's [ph] chemical business did very well on the back of the existing Lake Charles cracker. Maybe you could give an indication of what U.S. profits were and also how that's panned out in the first few months of this year? Also, I noticed the overall electricity costs seem to have gone down which I'm surprised at, given Eskom's hikes, so I just wondered what the situation was there? So those are my 3 questions.\n\n---\n\nAlex, we'll I think we're going give these all to Paul. 2050 strategy, obviously, you need to take CO2 into consideration. Let's start with that one, Paul.\n\n---\n\nGood. Yes, Alex, we have taken carbon tax into account. We have taken certain assumptions and we were conservative in terms of the impact of carbon tax in our 2015 modeling. However, we haven't taken a cliff [ph] into account, in our modeling, due to the uncertainty of exactly how the long term legislation will plan out in terms of carbon tax. So to answer your question, yes, we have included that. In terms of the U.S. profits from our business there, it's still LTE [ph] profits in the region of ZAR 4 billion plus for the 6 months under review, being contributed from our U.S. assets. And then, on the electricity side, there is also some benefit in terms of the short-term PPIs that gets offset against the cost of your electricity, and we have seen good stability, also, in our plants that reduces the requirement to import electricity from Eskom.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And what charge per ton did you include into the CO2 then?\n\n---\n\nAlex, we're not going to disclose that. We have said previously, in terms of the mechanisms, that there is a certain reduction and rebates that we are taking into account, and we've previously signaled a -- between a 60% to a 70% OpEx and within that range we have planned the carbon tax.\n\n---\n\nYes, that gets you the answer. We took the thresholds into account and then built it on top of the main price. We built it, took it off the main price. Operator?\n\n---\n\nYes, just a couple of questions. Just on the costs that you spend on gas-to-liquids, I guess, the 2 elements is, you've capitalized some of the GTL costs in the U.S.A. after concluding your feasibility study. What's the situation there? Are you looking to pay those costs? Do you have any idea of how much money you've spent on gas-to-liquids and coal-to-liquids projects, let's say, over the last decade of projects that haven't materialized? And then, I see that you increased drilling -- your drilling budget in Canada from $369 million in 2014 to $389 million this year. Is that -- would you say that's prudent in the current environment and do you have control over this CapEx, can you cut back if you need to? And then, lastly, maybe just try and explain this reclassifying the company as a specialty chemicals company? Surely, that's not in line with your production profile.\n\n---\n\nGerhard, we'll start with the U.S.A. -- the feasibility study cost and moving into feed and the capitalization of the same, Paul?\n\n---\n\nYes, Gerhard, as I've said before and ultimately, what's on the balance sheet is in order of $300 million. Basically, we -- at half [ph] year end, we have had a look at it and the accounting rules that you apply is, if you -- well, we haven't canceled the project, we just delayed the project. So if we can use those engineering studies going forward, which we plan to do so based on future economics and FID discussion, then you can carry it on your balance sheet. It's only when you've made a decision not to continue with the project and to cancel it officially that you have to impair it. You will also notice that we have written off, roundabout, $2.5 million of that cost which is certainly not substantial, but our auditors also feel comfortable that, given the accounting rules that we actually are allowed to capitalize and continue to capitalize until such time that we make a future investment decision.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Paul. On the -- on Canada, on drilling costs, we're -- as Paul said earlier, derisking that asset, spending minimal amounts of capital. We have 2 rigs running -- we did have 2 rigs running in the first half the year, 1 on Farrell Creek, 1 on Cypress A. And we want to look more in the Cypress A asset so we'll be adding 1 rig -- in fact, we've just added a rig, a third rig. So we've got 2 rigs working on Cyprus and just 1 at Farrell Creek, and that's very -- that's a very low rig recount if we just continue derisking the asset. We're only -- I think, we're at 5% complete so it's a long, long way to go as we work through that drilling program. By the way, the drilling costs have come down below our investment case, which is also positive -- the average well costs, in the first half, were down to $7.8 million for drilling and completion so that's a very good news, well below the investment case. Do we have control? We definitely have a say in the CapEx funding and the development plan there, the -- which is done on calendar years and participate, and certainly, have a voice and a say in how to proceed with rigs, so we're comfortable with that. We're sufficiently involved with the operator there, who, I should say is, we've seen great performance from Progress Energy on the operations of that asset. Chemicals company, the JSE has advised us that we're a chemicals company and we'll also say that 56.2% of our revenues, generated in the first half, were from chemicals and 44% of our profits so, certainly, that helps in that regard. I'm not sure how JSE does it, Paul, can you give us...?\n\n---\n\nYes, so basically, they look at your assets, they look at your earnings and based on that profile and, also, in terms of the previous financial information that we've presented, we have been now classified as part of the NDE 25 [ph] and in similar vein, the MCRO will do exactly the same, and we also expect a re-rating from them or reclassification apologies from them, in terms of the in the -- energy sector in which we're going to be consolidated in.\n\n---\n\nJust in terms of the Response Plan, the ZAR 30 billion to ZAR 50 billion per annum, can you maybe give us some guidance in terms of how we should look at that year-on-year? Because if I just look at CapEx for instance, so you are talking about ZAR 13 billion to ZAR 22 billion in the next 30 months, but there's only about ZAR 5 billion in FY '15 and then the rest is delivered FY '17. So as that it will be pretty helpful if you can just give us some guidance as to what to expect year-by-year, I know you've said ZAR 6 billion to ZAR 10 billion this year. And then just that ZAR 5 billion CapEx cut for FY '15, can you, maybe, just give us some color in terms of what is that made out of? I mean -- and also, just indicate what portion of that is the delay in the GTL progress and then as that the -- what makes up the other components? And then just in terms of that ZAR 4 billion to ZAR 7 billion of cost savings reduction, which is also part of that Response Plan, I mean, just the examples that you gave it sort of indicates though -- my impression is that, that should have been something that should be captured in Project Phoenix. So maybe just can you give a bit more color in terms of what exactly that is? Why is there -- why is only ZAR 1 billion of that sustainable? And then just -- yes, I think let's leave it at that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Just on your second question, and then I'll turn it over to Paul for the Response Plan targets. But the ZAR 1 billion sustainable savings, as you know, will be on top of the Phoenix savings of ZAR 4.3 billion. So that ZAR 1 billion of cash -- of cash cost savings, as Paul went through that, those vacancies of 500 to 1,000 people is going to drive a good portion of that savings. We think we can run the company as a leaner organization going forward and only fill critical vacancies going forward. So that -- our moratorium on hiring, freezing, firing is going to allow was to see that savings in addition to Phoenix, that was not the plan under Phoenix. Those positions were going to be filled previously but from what we're seeing now, and getting into it and analyzing it further, we think we can see a good chunk of the sustainable Response Plan savings from the vacancies. And then, I think -- yes, I'm just giving you a couple big ones, because Paul mixes in a lot of dogs and cats in there as well. But the other big one are the 200 permanent management people, further structural change through these 200 more senior management personnel, that's a big change to what we had over and above Phoenix and we're comfortable that those are sustainable moves as well, based on our new structures. Paul, on targets Response Plan and a little more color on the capital -- both capital growth and sustenance?\n\n---\n\nSo Nishal, basically, the reason why we have given the ZAR 30 billion to ZAR 50 billion range is also to take into account, as David also mentioned, that we're also watching and see where the market is going in terms of finding a new equilibrium. So it's also important for us, as the market picks up, that we will start to also execute growth programs that can add future sustainable value. So it's really depending, also, on where share prices -- sorry, where oil price is going now quick and that's why, firstly, you see the wider range. Now in terms of the guidance for every financial year, we are providing guidance for this year. You can make a call in terms of the remaining portion of the ZAR 30 billion to ZAR 50 billion over the following 2 years, because effectively these 2 years that remains. So we'll provide guidance in every financial year as we progress and, also, as we see where oil prices go and how the macroeconomics is going to play up. So there's a lot of dynamics and also flexibility that we've built into the Response Plan to also react quicker or even slower as oil prices picks up or stay at the current levels. So at this stage we don't provide any further guidance on that. Your second question in terms of, so what actually makes up the ZAR 5 billion. Obviously, there's a lot of projects that you have gone through. The key ones, obviously, will be your U.S. GTL deferral, that will be the first one. Secondly we've also delayed the extend on Clean Fuels II, for example. There's also a couple of other sustenance projects that is delayed, that's been surely later, I've talked in a little bit more detail about, and then, also, in terms of what we originally planned to spend in the Montney versus what we're actually spending in the Montney is also less. So those are really the 4 big-ticket items making your ZAR 5 billion up.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just -- sorry, just a follow-up. So that management, the 200 further management positions cut, what would be the cost for implementing that, per diem [ph] will be a cost for that?\n\n---\n\nYes, sure. There will be a cost, but that has already been factored in into our Response Plan activity. You will not see that as being part of the ZAR 2.1 billion cost that we've indicated for Project Phoenix. It will be separate to that. However, we do believe in terms of the savings potential of the Response Plan, even in this year, specifically, with regards to those 200 positions as well as not filling vacancies and doing all the other things that we've spoken about, it will be self-funding and also contributing already in the 2015 financial year.\n\n---\n\nGood. Thanks very much for calling in today. Gerhard, we'll get back to you on the CTL, GTL question and how much has been spent over the last decade or so, we'll get into that with you as well, sometime this week. And I want to thank, everyone, for joining us and look forward to -- Paul and I look forward -- and Bongani, look forward to visiting with many of you during our upcoming Investor and Analyst roadshows over the next few weeks. So thanks, again. Take care. Bye-bye.\n\n---\n\nThank you.",

That is a downstream gas market development fund that we are contributing to -- through our partners in Mozambique to, hopefully, get additional downstream projects off the ground, which can obviously benefit our oil and gas development activities in the country. So that's where we're working with the international -- IFC and ENH partners to put that fund together and, like I say, help develop downstream gas markets in Mozambique.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jarrett Geldenhuys (Analysts)】\nI've also got about 3 questions, please. Just, firstly, on maintenance CapEx. I realize you say that your volumes are paramount. I just would like to know where -- exactly in which business units the maintenance CapEx savings seems to be coming through? And then, the second question just relates to the chemical volumes. So a good performance on chemicals, I just want to know if you can split this out of which -- what is the contribution from -- or positive contribution from EPU5 as well as the C3 stabilization plant and I suppose, operations in general, relative to market demand? And then the last question is just in addition to these additional ZAR 1 billion worth of cost savings, which you mentioned sustainable from 2018, I just want to understand the scope difference between this and Project Phoenix or is this just, more efficiently, coming out of Project Phoenix? And that's about it.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nJarrett, I'll ask, on the first one, if Paul can talk about the maintenance CapEx savings, and then I'll talk about the chemicals volumes and then I think Paul's got the ZAR 1 billion answer as well. Go ahead, Paul.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Victor (Executives)】\nGood. Jarrett, yes, so basically when we look in terms of the maintenance capital expenditure, we were, obviously, in our thinking a lot of non-negotiables, in terms of capping future cash savings from. So specifically, the shutdown in Secunda, the renewal program and, specifically, all the maintenance work on the GOs and the boilers and so forth that we haven't optimized. But there is a big portion of later, other sustenance capital projects that you'd look at across the value chain and where we've either delayed or stopped a project. So the whole value chain was however impacted by the reduction of the optimization of the sustenance spend and ultimately we have provided those ranges and then ultimately, certain non-negotiables, specifically, ensuring long-term sustainability, reliability and availability of the plant.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nThanks, Paul. And Jarrett, you're exactly correct in chemicals volumes in, certainly, in polymers. EPU5, which has been up and running since last year now added an additional 47,000 tons annually and reduced flaring, I think we've talked about flaring that was reduced from 7% to 1% based on that installation. C3 stabilization reached beneficial operation in just at the very end of our last, this -- I guess, at the start of this financial year and added another 58,000 tons per year. So those are 2 key areas that we see coming through nicely in polymers. And then, keep an eye out for the C3 expansion which has beneficial operation in June of this year, with a capacity of a 105,000 tons per year. So those are -- those 2 existing and 1 coming on, shortly is -- will be very nice for the polymers or part of the base chemicals business. Paul, ZAR 1 billion on sustainable savings Response Plan FY '18?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Victor (Executives)】\nSo the question is on the sustainability and whether it is just a further extension of the Project Phoenix. We don't see it, we really drive the Response Plan as a additional project in our business. In terms of looking at the sustainability, yes, from a clean perspective it's actually levering further efficiency improvement in our overall cash cost base. So while Project Phoenix is very much focused on cash fixed cost base and limited to other cash cost, the Response Plan is actually looking at the overall cash cost base, which really opened up, let's say, the size of the prize a bit more. In terms of the general things that we are looking for we are further optimizing our structures, as we previously communicated, through the consolidation of international energy, our South African Energy is one example. We also saw in our syns [ph] Announcement, we're also levering -- not filling, certain noncritical vacancies and we plan to see whether we can actually continue with those or that right-staff establishment going forward. David also spoke about the 200 managerial staff that we further optimized, as a result of the new Response Plan, and then, generally, we're also looking quite differently at our supply chain and also renegotiating contracts, we'd say, quite more diligently as part of this process in order to save cash costs on a sustainable basis. So definitely, the theme is on much more efficiency but taking a little bit more focus on a wider cost bucket as opposed to Project Phoenix.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nThanks Paul. We'll take the next question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alex Comer (Analysts)】\nJust got a few questions. On -- Firstly, on -- you extended the life of your plants...\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nSorry, Alex. Operator, we can't hear the question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alex Comer (Analysts)】\nCan you hear me?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nTry again. That's a little better.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alex Comer (Analysts)】\nYes, you extended the life of your plant to 2015 and that helped these journeys a little bit. I was just wondering, what -- did you include any sort of, carbon tax in your assumption, when you did that, given that, if you look at the IAS and very, sort of, significant carbon costs going forward? So the first question. Secondly, historically, you've given out a U.S. profit. So I would assume that the port's [ph] chemical business did very well on the back of the existing Lake Charles cracker. Maybe you could give an indication of what U.S. profits were and also how that's panned out in the first few months of this year? Also, I noticed the overall electricity costs seem to have gone down which I'm surprised at, given Eskom's hikes, so I just wondered what the situation was there? So those are my 3 questions.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nAlex, we'll I think we're going give these all to Paul. 2050 strategy, obviously, you need to take CO2 into consideration. Let's start with that one, Paul.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Victor (Executives)】\nGood. Yes, Alex, we have taken carbon tax into account. We have taken certain assumptions and we were conservative in terms of the impact of carbon tax in our 2015 modeling. However, we haven't taken a cliff [ph] into account, in our modeling, due to the uncertainty of exactly how the long term legislation will plan out in terms of carbon tax. So to answer your question, yes, we have included that. In terms of the U.S. profits from our business there, it's still LTE [ph] profits in the region of ZAR 4 billion plus for the 6 months under review, being contributed from our U.S. assets. And then, on the electricity side, there is also some benefit in terms of the short-term PPIs that gets offset against the cost of your electricity, and we have seen good stability, also, in our plants that reduces the requirement to import electricity from Eskom.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alex Comer (Analysts)】\nOkay. And what charge per ton did you include into the CO2 then?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Victor (Executives)】\nAlex, we're not going to disclose that. We have said previously, in terms of the mechanisms, that there is a certain reduction and rebates that we are taking into account, and we've previously signaled a -- between a 60% to a 70% OpEx and within that range we have planned the carbon tax.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nYes, that gets you the answer. We took the thresholds into account and then built it on top of the main price. We built it, took it off the main price. Operator?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Gerhard Engelbrecht (Analysts)】\nYes, just a couple of questions. Just on the costs that you spend on gas-to-liquids, I guess, the 2 elements is, you've capitalized some of the GTL costs in the U.S.A. after concluding your feasibility study. What's the situation there? Are you looking to pay those costs? Do you have any idea of how much money you've spent on gas-to-liquids and coal-to-liquids projects, let's say, over the last decade of projects that haven't materialized? And then, I see that you increased drilling -- your drilling budget in Canada from $369 million in 2014 to $389 million this year. Is that -- would you say that's prudent in the current environment and do you have control over this CapEx, can you cut back if you need to? And then, lastly, maybe just try and explain this reclassifying the company as a specialty chemicals company? Surely, that's not in line with your production profile.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nGerhard, we'll start with the U.S.A. -- the feasibility study cost and moving into feed and the capitalization of the same, Paul?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Victor (Executives)】\nYes, Gerhard, as I've said before and ultimately, what's on the balance sheet is in order of $300 million. Basically, we -- at half [ph] year end, we have had a look at it and the accounting rules that you apply is, if you -- well, we haven't canceled the project, we just delayed the project. So if we can use those engineering studies going forward, which we plan to do so based on future economics and FID discussion, then you can carry it on your balance sheet. It's only when you've made a decision not to continue with the project and to cancel it officially that you have to impair it. You will also notice that we have written off, roundabout, $2.5 million of that cost which is certainly not substantial, but our auditors also feel comfortable that, given the accounting rules that we actually are allowed to capitalize and continue to capitalize until such time that we make a future investment decision.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nThanks, Paul. On the -- on Canada, on drilling costs, we're -- as Paul said earlier, derisking that asset, spending minimal amounts of capital. We have 2 rigs running -- we did have 2 rigs running in the first half the year, 1 on Farrell Creek, 1 on Cypress A. And we want to look more in the Cypress A asset so we'll be adding 1 rig -- in fact, we've just added a rig, a third rig. So we've got 2 rigs working on Cyprus and just 1 at Farrell Creek, and that's very -- that's a very low rig recount if we just continue derisking the asset. We're only -- I think, we're at 5% complete so it's a long, long way to go as we work through that drilling program. By the way, the drilling costs have come down below our investment case, which is also positive -- the average well costs, in the first half, were down to $7.8 million for drilling and completion so that's a very good news, well below the investment case. Do we have control? We definitely have a say in the CapEx funding and the development plan there, the -- which is done on calendar years and participate, and certainly, have a voice and a say in how to proceed with rigs, so we're comfortable with that. We're sufficiently involved with the operator there, who, I should say is, we've seen great performance from Progress Energy on the operations of that asset. Chemicals company, the JSE has advised us that we're a chemicals company and we'll also say that 56.2% of our revenues, generated in the first half, were from chemicals and 44% of our profits so, certainly, that helps in that regard. I'm not sure how JSE does it, Paul, can you give us...?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Victor (Executives)】\nYes, so basically, they look at your assets, they look at your earnings and based on that profile and, also, in terms of the previous financial information that we've presented, we have been now classified as part of the NDE 25 [ph] and in similar vein, the MCRO will do exactly the same, and we also expect a re-rating from them or reclassification apologies from them, in terms of the in the -- energy sector in which we're going to be consolidated in.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nishal Ramloutan (Analysts)】\nJust in terms of the Response Plan, the ZAR 30 billion to ZAR 50 billion per annum, can you maybe give us some guidance in terms of how we should look at that year-on-year? Because if I just look at CapEx for instance, so you are talking about ZAR 13 billion to ZAR 22 billion in the next 30 months, but there's only about ZAR 5 billion in FY '15 and then the rest is delivered FY '17. So as that it will be pretty helpful if you can just give us some guidance as to what to expect year-by-year, I know you've said ZAR 6 billion to ZAR 10 billion this year. And then just that ZAR 5 billion CapEx cut for FY '15, can you, maybe, just give us some color in terms of what is that made out of? I mean -- and also, just indicate what portion of that is the delay in the GTL progress and then as that the -- what makes up the other components? And then just in terms of that ZAR 4 billion to ZAR 7 billion of cost savings reduction, which is also part of that Response Plan, I mean, just the examples that you gave it sort of indicates though -- my impression is that, that should have been something that should be captured in Project Phoenix. So maybe just can you give a bit more color in terms of what exactly that is? Why is there -- why is only ZAR 1 billion of that sustainable? And then just -- yes, I think let's leave it at that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nOkay. Just on your second question, and then I'll turn it over to Paul for the Response Plan targets. But the ZAR 1 billion sustainable savings, as you know, will be on top of the Phoenix savings of ZAR 4.3 billion. So that ZAR 1 billion of cash -- of cash cost savings, as Paul went through that, those vacancies of 500 to 1,000 people is going to drive a good portion of that savings. We think we can run the company as a leaner organization going forward and only fill critical vacancies going forward. So that -- our moratorium on hiring, freezing, firing is going to allow was to see that savings in addition to Phoenix, that was not the plan under Phoenix. Those positions were going to be filled previously but from what we're seeing now, and getting into it and analyzing it further, we think we can see a good chunk of the sustainable Response Plan savings from the vacancies. And then, I think -- yes, I'm just giving you a couple big ones, because Paul mixes in a lot of dogs and cats in there as well. But the other big one are the 200 permanent management people, further structural change through these 200 more senior management personnel, that's a big change to what we had over and above Phoenix and we're comfortable that those are sustainable moves as well, based on our new structures. Paul, on targets Response Plan and a little more color on the capital -- both capital growth and sustenance?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Victor (Executives)】\nSo Nishal, basically, the reason why we have given the ZAR 30 billion to ZAR 50 billion range is also to take into account, as David also mentioned, that we're also watching and see where the market is going in terms of finding a new equilibrium. So it's also important for us, as the market picks up, that we will start to also execute growth programs that can add future sustainable value. So it's really depending, also, on where share prices -- sorry, where oil price is going now quick and that's why, firstly, you see the wider range. Now in terms of the guidance for every financial year, we are providing guidance for this year. You can make a call in terms of the remaining portion of the ZAR 30 billion to ZAR 50 billion over the following 2 years, because effectively these 2 years that remains. So we'll provide guidance in every financial year as we progress and, also, as we see where oil prices go and how the macroeconomics is going to play up. So there's a lot of dynamics and also flexibility that we've built into the Response Plan to also react quicker or even slower as oil prices picks up or stay at the current levels. So at this stage we don't provide any further guidance on that. Your second question in terms of, so what actually makes up the ZAR 5 billion. Obviously, there's a lot of projects that you have gone through. The key ones, obviously, will be your U.S. GTL deferral, that will be the first one. Secondly we've also delayed the extend on Clean Fuels II, for example. There's also a couple of other sustenance projects that is delayed, that's been surely later, I've talked in a little bit more detail about, and then, also, in terms of what we originally planned to spend in the Montney versus what we're actually spending in the Montney is also less. So those are really the 4 big-ticket items making your ZAR 5 billion up.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Nishal Ramloutan (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just -- sorry, just a follow-up. So that management, the 200 further management positions cut, what would be the cost for implementing that, per diem [ph] will be a cost for that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Victor (Executives)】\nYes, sure. There will be a cost, but that has already been factored in into our Response Plan activity. You will not see that as being part of the ZAR 2.1 billion cost that we've indicated for Project Phoenix. It will be separate to that. However, we do believe in terms of the savings potential of the Response Plan, even in this year, specifically, with regards to those 200 positions as well as not filling vacancies and doing all the other things that we've spoken about, it will be self-funding and also contributing already in the 2015 financial year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Edward Constable (Executives)】\nGood. Thanks very much for calling in today. Gerhard, we'll get back to you on the CTL, GTL question and how much has been spent over the last decade or so, we'll get into that with you as well, sometime this week. And I want to thank, everyone, for joining us and look forward to -- Paul and I look forward -- and Bongani, look forward to visiting with many of you during our upcoming Investor and Analyst roadshows over the next few weeks. So thanks, again. Take care. Bye-bye.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Paul Victor (Executives)】\nThank you.",

      "transcript_text1": "Okay. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us. Today, we will walk you through 2014 results and the strategy update over the next 4 years. Today's presentation will be started in 3 parts. First, I will start by outlining the main highlights of 2014. Antonio will then focus on our 2014 consolidated results. Finally, we will discuss our 2015, 2018 strategy and targets. \r\nLet me begin with the main highlights for the full year 2014 as well as providing you with an update on the business. We are pleased once again to report a solid set of result for 2014, achieved despite a tough and challenging environment. Snam's sound operating performance over the period is reflected by the EUR 3.6 billion of revenues and the EUR 2.8 billion of EBITDA, both at similar level to 2013. This is a remarkable result considering that 2014 is the first year of the full regulatory period for transmission, regasification and distribution businesses. The significant increase of 30.6% in net profit is the combined result of: firstly, lower interest expenses during the period, mostly reflecting the significant reduction in our average cost of debt. Antonio will share all the details in a moment. Secondly, higher contribution from our associates, highlighting the sound return of our European investments. And finally, the reduction of the tax rate as well as the nonrecurring effect related to the recalculation of the fair taxes due to the Robin Hood tax cancellation. All these elements allowed us to reach reported net income of around EUR 1.2 billion, a remarkable increase of 30.6% versus 2013. \r\nTurning to our growth path. Our investments are aimed at increasing the flexibility, liquidity and security of both the Italian and the European system, enhancing gas flows and interconnectivity of EU markets. In 2014, we deployed total investment of approximately EUR 1.8 billion. Around EUR 1.3 billion was attributed to CapEx for infrastructure development in Italy, in line with the guidance provided at the beginning of the year. And around EUR 500 million to finance -- to financial investment for the acquisition of the 8 -- 89.2% [ph] equity interest in TAG. Consistent with our strict financial discipline, the CapEx were covered by the operating cash flow, which reached a sound level of around EUR 1.5 billion. It has allowed us to maintain a solid balance sheet with the net financial debt of EUR 13.6 billion, up by EUR 300 million compared to year-end 2013. This is a significant result considering the EUR 1.8 billion of investments carried out during the year. \r\nThe acquisition of TAG strengthens Snam's leading role amongst infrastructure operators in Europe. It allow us to manage a strategic asset for the development of the European East-West energy corridor, encouraging increased integration of continental energy networks, in part due to its potential use in a reverse flow toward the Central Europe markets. In the same gas corridor, we have an update of TIGF. At the end of February 2015, Snam and its partners finalized the entry of a Credit Agricole Assurances into the share capital of TIGF with a 10% stake. \r\nSnam received slightly over EUR 80 million implying a value of more than EUR 1.8 billion for the 100% of the equity. This represent an approximately 40% increase compared to the total equity value at the time of the acquisition of TIGF. This illustrates the value added by our management of the company carried out in less than 2 years. \r\nAs you know, Snam has consistently been committed to delivering sustainable and attractive returns to its shareholders. On the basis of 2014 sound results and considering our solid capital structure, the Board of Directors yesterday decided to propose at the Annual General Meeting, a dividend distribution of EUR 0.25 per share for the fiscal year 2014, thus, confirming our announced dividend policy. The fiscal year 2014 dividend, subject to the approval at the shareholder meeting, results in a dividend yield of around 6% at the top range of the utility sector. \r\nI will now hand over to Antonio, who will discuss our 2014 consolidated result in more detail.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Carlo, and good afternoon, everyone. 2014 Snam's results were characterized by some relevant events: first year of a new regulatory period for transport, regasification and distribution activities; low gas demand; the consolidation starting from July 1, 2014, AES Torino, the gas distribution company operating in Turin; the Robin Tax that in 2014 decreased from 10.5% to 6.5%, and in 2015 has been considered generating a one-off positive adjustment of EUR 120 million to deferred  tax fund. Moreover, at the end of 2014, we have finalized through dedicated capital increase, the interest acquisition in TAG, which will contribute to consolidated results starting from 2015. \r\nLooking at 2014 consolidated income statement. EBIT amounted to EUR 1,973 million. The resilience of regulated revenues in the first year of the new regulatory period and the strict control of operating costs have supported 2014 results, that reached a level substantially in line with the previous year. On a like-for-like basis, not taking into consideration some one-off item accounting in 2013 and '14, that would be discussed later on. \r\nEBIT showed a slight decrease of approximately 0.4%. Net profit grew by around 31% to EUR 1,188 million, benefiting from the significant reduction in our average cost of debt, reflecting the debt optimization measures carried out so far, the increase in incomes from associates, driven by the positive contribution of TIGF and a nonrecurring positive item related to the equity interest in AES Torino and the positive effect related to the Robin Tax due to both its reduction to 6.5% in 2014 and to the positive adjustment of deferred tax fund for EUR 120 million following its cancellation starting from this year. 2014 adjusted net profit, net of deferred tax fund adjustment recorded an increase of around 50%. \r\n2014 total revenues amounted to EUR 3,566 million, showing an increase of EUR 37 million. Regulated revenues, net of pass-through components increased by EUR 37 million, up 1.1% compared to 2013, reflecting the following contributions by business segment. Transport revenues marked an increase of EUR 17 million. Deposit contribution from the investment carried out in 2012 equaled to EUR 86 million, was partially balanced by the tariff adjustment of the new regulatory period of EUR 60 million and the effect of the decrease of gas injected into the network of around EUR 9 million. \r\nDistribution revenues grew by EUR 9 million. The growth is the result of the slight reduction in regulated revenues following the new regulatory period and the contribution of the consolidation of AES Torino from July 1 equal to EUR 37 million. Storage revenues increased by EUR 14 million, mainly due to the contribution of the investment carried out in 2012. The decrease in pass-through revenues was mainly due to the overall gas transport system balancing services. Other revenues amounted to EUR 60 million, an increase of EUR 22 million compared to the previous year. \r\nMoving to operating expenses. Total cost in 2014 amounted to EUR 790 million. Net of pass-through components, operating costs were equal to EUR 673 million, recording an increase of EUR 86 million, mainly related to some one-off risk fund provisions of EUR 95 million accounted among other costs. Controllable fixed costs in 2014 amounted to EUR 471 million, an increase limited to EUR 11 million compared to 2013, mainly due to the incremental cost for the consolidation of AES Torino of around EUR 8 million. Considering the same parameter of business, controllable fixed cost result substantially flat in nominal terms confirming our continuous attention to cost control and the capability to achieve efficiency targets. \r\nVariable costs reduced by EUR 10 million, mainly in the distribution business due to the energy efficiency certificates. Other costs equal to EUR 154 million, increased by EUR 89 million due to the above-mentioned one-off risk fund provision of EUR 95 million. No impact on the cash flow, for sure. EUR 75 million referred to the balancing activities accounted for in 2012 both in the transport and storage segments, and EUR 20 million were relative to some local infrastructure in the distribution business. Nonregulated costs amounting to EUR 40 million decreased by EUR 4 million, mainly in the distribution business. \r\nMoving to the cost breakdown by business. Net of pass-through costs, we accounted the growth of EUR 42 million in the transport business and of EUR 27 million in the storage business, both related to the risk fund provisions. Consolidated EBIT amounted to EUR 1,973 million, with a decrease of EUR 61 million. Net of one-off item, EBIT remained substantially flat, with the growth of approximately 0.4% on a like-for-like basis as a result of the increase in regulated revenues of EUR 37 million, the increase in controllable fixed costs of EUR 11 million, the increase in depreciation and amortization for EUR 34 million mainly due to the new asset enter into operation for EUR 14 million, the change of certain assets' technical life in the distribution business according to the new regulatory framework for about EUR 12 million and for the remaining part to the consolidation of AES Torino from July 2014. \r\nFinally, other positive effects of EUR 16 million, mainly reflecting the reduction in variable cost and the positive contribution from nonregulated activities. \r\nIn terms of business segments, net of one-off items, let us underline the positive contribution of storage reporting an EBIT growth of EUR 30 million, up 9.4%. The transport business growing of about EUR 13 million, up 1.1%. The distribution segment registered an EBIT decrease of EUR 19 million, down 3.7% mainly due to the slight reduction in the regulated revenues following the new regulatory period. \r\nGiven the significant and growing contribution granted by our nonconsolidated associates, it's worth underlining their results in terms of both impact on income and our cash flow. Net income from associates amounted to EUR 131 million, recorded an increase of EUR 86 million, mainly due to the higher equity contribution of TIGF, EUR 51 million, that, as you know, last year was negatively affected by a tax burden related to the acquisition. And secondly, the consolidation of AES Torino from July 2014, which has 2 effects. Firstly, its equity contribution is limited to the first 6 months of the year. Secondly, the transaction generated a one-off positive effect from the restatement of the equity interest at its fair value. As far as cash dividends are concerned, in 2014, they amounted to EUR 99 million, recording an increase of EUR 29 million, essentially related to TIGF. \r\nNow I would like to conclude the review of our income statement further commenting the net profit performance. Net profit in 2014 was EUR 1,198 million, up 30.6% compared to the previous year. Net profit adjusted for the special item increased by 15.4%. 2013 net profit was adjusted for the net effect of the early retirement plan, EUR 17 million. While 2014 net profit is adjusted for the effect of deferred tax fund following the Robin Hood tax consolidation. Analyzing the item below EBIT, net profit growth has been supported by: firstly, the reduction in interest expenses of EUR 75 million, mainly due to a lower average cost of debt that benefited from the significant debt optimization measures carried out so far, partially offset by the higher average outstanding debt and some upfront fees accounted last year following the repayment in advance of a term loan financing subscribed in 2012. Details on debt structure and cost of debt evolution will be provided in the following slide. Secondly, the net profit growth was supported by the already commented increase in net income from associates of EUR 86 million. Finally, we accounted the reduction of the tax credit to around 37%, mainly due to the decrease in 2014 of the Robin Tax from the rate of -- to the rate of 6.5%. \r\nMoving on to the results of the 2014 debt optimization exercise. The main actions executed may be summarized as follows. New recourse [ph] to debt capital market, both via publications and via private placements for a total amount of 1,075,000,000 -- EUR 1,750,000,000 exploiting favorable market conditions and the compressions of Snam's spread in the debt capital market. As a result -- as regards banking facilities, in 2014, Snam showed a proactive approach performing in advance pool and bilateral banking facilities refinancing for an overall amount of around EUR 5 billion in order to extend the maturity and reduce the cost of the lines. Disintermediation of certain European investment bank financing for around EUR 300 million with a significant cost savings of -- following cost savings. Growing role of uncommitted credit lines, debt reached more than EUR 1 billion at the end of the year, leveraging on abundant market liquidity and recent central bank actions. It is worth stressing the fact that the actions carried out in 2014 are in line with our financial strategy and achievement, consistent with our targets. In 2014, cost of debt decreased to around 3.2% versus 3.7% of the last year. The fixed-rate portion is 69% in line with our plan to have around 2/3 of our debt at fixed rate. The maturity profile is well spread over time avoiding major concentration issues going forward and without banking refinancing until 2017, with an average maturity of around 5 years. The strong liquidity profile covers 24-month maturities. \r\nIn 2014, Snam confirmed once more its strong capability in the cash flow generation that reached the level of about EUR 1.8 billion. The working capital absorption of EUR 275 million was mainly related to the tax payment of about EUR 135 million due to 2013 tax balance of about EUR 88 million, and 2014 advance payments higher than the tax accrued in the year of EUR 47 million. For the remaining part, to nonstructured payable accounted at the year-end 2013 and paid at the beginning of 2014. \r\nMoving to net investments. Snam confirmed also in 2014 its growth strategy fueled by a level of net investment higher than EUR 1.7 million -- billion, of which EUR 1.2 billion related to CapEx in the regulated business in Italy and EUR 0.5 billion referred to the TAG acquisition, which, as you know, was fully financed through a dedicated capital increase. The result is a 2014 positive free cash flow close to EUR 300 million. Given the evolution of the cash flow from operation and net investment already commented, net financial debt at the year end 2014 amounted to EUR 13,652 million, well in line with our targets. The debt increase of EUR 356 million compared to the year end 2013, was related to the AES Torino debt consolidation and to the payment of 2013 dividend balance. \r\nTurning to the balance sheet. Fixed assets increased by EUR 1.2 billion versus year end 2013 as a result of CapEx realized in Italy, the TAG acquisition and the consolidation of AES Torino for a total amount of EUR 2 billion, partially offset by assets depreciation of EUR 0.8 billion. \r\nIn conclusion, coming to the leverage, the growth of our asset base together with our strict financial discipline, allowed us to achieve a ratio of debt to total RAB and associates of around 52% compared to 53% recorded in 2013. \r\nThat's all for me. I will now hand over to Carlo for the strategic plan 2015-18.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Antonio. Let me now walk you through 2015-2018 strategy and target. Our goal of achieving sustainable returns and profitable growth will be attained through a focus on 4 strategic priorities that preserve our low risk profile.  First, disciplined management of investment opportunities will allow us to exploit the optionality of our asset portfolio through capitalizing on high-quality growth opportunities in Italy, focusing on 2 main European gas corridor, the East-West and the North-South corridors to integrate and complement our asset portfolio as well as to diversify our country and regulatory risk. Second, we will continuously improve our operational management. This will be accomplished by progressing towards obtaining the role of market facilitator, providing integrated services to shippers and final customers. We will also continue to control costs. Third, pursue sound financial discipline through investing in value-additive CapEx as well as consolidating our solid and efficient capital structure. M&A activity will be selective and aimed at returns' accretion. Drive value for all of our stakeholders through profitable and steady growth even in a low-inflation environment. We will continue to pay a sustainable dividend, thereby delivering attractive shareholder returns. \r\nStarting with the business environment. I would like to draw your attention to the following main trends in the European gas market. Gas demand in Europe is expected to remain almost flat over the coming decades. However, this would not imply a static marketplace as a decline in the regions' gas reserves and production, particularly in North Sea, will increase Europe's net gas imports from around 65% of total demand in 2013 to a remarkable 75% in 2030. And this import deficit will be geographically imbalanced, the highest import needs being contracted -- concentrated in North Europe. Overall, Europe will become more dependent on non-EU sources, Russia, Middle East, North Africa with an important new contribution by the Caspian region where most gas reserves are concentrated. This market development will generate a significant shift in EU  internal gas flows with Southern EU becoming a crucial entry point for additional import flows.  Furthermore, there is a growing need to balance peaks in gas demand due to its increasing volatility as intermittent renewable energy sources need to be backed up by production in gas fuel combined cycle. These peaks, which require intensive availability of transport and storage capacity, are increasingly uncorrelated to the overall trend in gas demand. This trend imply the need to build out gas infrastructure to facilitate the matching between imported gas and gas demand as well as to integrate gas market to efficiently balance supply and demand. \r\nThe European natural gas industry is being challenged by several factors beyond the global economic downturn and competition in the energy production market. The market is still looking for the right equilibrium between new market needs and security of supply. This is the big challenge for years to come. Along the gas chain, we can observe a re-definition of long-term established roles. Upstream players are willing to get closer to the consumer market, thus, bypassing the traditional gas importers. The latter will also face increasing competition brought by traders and by final consumers. All this translate into a higher degree of volatility in the market. This will become even more evident with more gas supply contracts being renegotiated and linked to the gas spot market rather than to long-term contracts. \r\nOn the other hand, it's important to stress that the complete cancellation of the take-or-pay contracts may become an issue as it affected the security of supply that remain a priority at European level, particularly considering high dependence of single-supply sources and political instability of certain exporters. Infrastructure availability will need to change accordingly and be much more flexible than in the past. Its development will no longer be driven only by the growth of gas demand, but will be required to improve the security of supply, enable the integration of domestic market into a single European marketplace, connected to the highest number of supply sources and provide efficient services encouraging energy price competition versus cheaper but more polluting fuel like oil. \r\nAdditional transmission system and storage facility will have to be developed to cope with highly volatile demand providing the required peak capacity to ensure a secure, reliable and sustainable response to the needs of consumers. Storage is the main resource to tackle potential gas flow shortages. Institution and the regulators should work together to design appropriate measure to pool parts of existing and new gas security stock at European level, ensuring the full utilization and further development of a strategic storage for the continent. This would be possible under several conditions: a common set of rule to establish transit condition of gas from the countries where storage is physically located to consumption site; and an international body able to coordinate specific rule and condition for the use of strategic storage; the debottlenecking of national gas grid; and the availability of reserve flow capacity at cross-border interconnection points. \r\nThe European gas market is characterized by a number of challenges, which can only be addressed by the creation of an interconnected pan-European gas network to diversify gas sourcing and increase the security of supply as well as to foster the flexibility. The integration of European gas network will be supported by the development of efficient and bidirectional cross-border gas corridors. This is the key to guaranteeing security of supply, enhancing competition of the gas market and promoting a smooth transition for an efficient and sustainable low-carbon economy. \r\nInfrastructure operators needed to design sustainable investment strategy to capture the opportunities generated by the rapidly changing business environment. Their role is evolving from being a mere asset owner, simply managing infrastructure to market facilitator providing innovative integrated services to shippers and final customers. At the same time, the availability of market-responsive services to meet the evolving needs of shippers and final customers, in particular, in terms of flexibility and service integration, is becoming increasingly crucial. A more flexible and shipper-friendly commercial offer and the implementation of common rules are necessary to promote the efficient functioning of the market to foster its liquidity and to preserve the security of supply. Specifically, more advanced commercial offer will aim at an integrated offer for -- of transport, storage and LNG services, with the latter more focused on short-term requirements; a higher degree of consistency between capacity and volume transported, supporting shippers in the optimization of their logistic portfolio. The development of new activities would allow an optimal access and utilization of the gas system by traders and shippers, thus, improving their performance. This will translate into revenue and investment sustainable for infrastructure operator. \r\nLet me now briefly focus your attention on Italy and specifically, on the distribution industry. From the chart, you can see that the Italian distribution market is still very fragmented between many small operators. The result is that the whole system works at a suboptimal level of efficiency. The recently completed legislative framework is expected to further enhance the consolidation process and increase the efficiency of the distribution through the substantial enlargement of concession areas to seek economy of scale, implying their significant reduction in number; a set of standard rules for the tender process based on economic conditions and parameters on security and quality of the services. The new business environment represents an important opportunity for Italgas as a leading, highly competitive and nationwide position player in the Italian market to unlock additional value. \r\nLet's now focus on how Snam can develop its strategy in this evolving environment. Let's start with our investment priorities. Snam's CapEx plan has to be analyzed in the context of the changing market environment we just described, which provides us with the optionality to pursue growth opportunity with a long-term vision. In order to support the development of the Italian/European gas market, gas network will have to guarantee high level of security, flexibility and liquidity. This will be achieved through the creation of substantial transport and storage capacity in Italy, including additional capacity to allow for the physical reverse flow of gas from Italy to other European countries, paving the way towards connecting North African countries, the new Caspian area and Eastern Mediterranean gas sources to Continental Europe. In particular, in the transport business, capital expenditure is devoted to meeting capacity requirements and to providing supply source diversification to the shippers. This development should facilitate not only a higher level of security and flexibility of the gas system, but also gas transit to European market via the reverse flow of gas from Italy to other countries. \r\nMoving on to storage. Our substantial investment program has been designed to guarantee greater storage capacity in the gas system both in terms of modulation and peak capacity, optimizing the balance of the overall system. At the same time, by increasing capacity, we can create a favorable condition for the development of higher liquidity in the gas system. This will set the path for  facilitating the use of our storage system for gas swap opportunities as well as to pull it for security purpose at the EU level in coming years. \r\nWith regards to the distribution business, investment will be focused on the development of new distribution networks, mainly in South of Italy and on the smart metering project, which will allow Italgas to guarantee a high level of service quality. More importantly, the new legislative framework, Italgas will both exploit consolidation opportunities and will begin optimizing its portfolio and concession, which we will discuss in further detail later on. \r\nThe plan for CapEx in Italy is EUR 5.1 billion over the next 4 years, which will support an estimated 1% annual growth in our consolidated regulatory asset base by 2018, starting from the 2014 estimated base just below EUR 25 million. We plan to manage the pace and timing of our investment to maintain our track record of profitable growth, improving capital efficiency and returns. The change versus the previous 4-year CapEx plan is mainly due to the shifting of spending related to the certain investment in the south of Italy in order to match the capacity need related to the TAP project as well as to the completion of some development project for the new storage capacity. \r\nIn 2015, we expect to invest EUR 1.3 billion, with the remaining EUR 3.8 billion to be spread over the remainder of the plan period. Furthermore, we will consolidate the profitability of our asset base, leveraging the incentive scheme set by the authority. With around 70% of total investment incentivized, with higher remuneration, the share of the overall RAB benefiting from incentivized remuneration will account for an average 1/3 of the total for the plan period. \r\nOver the 4-year business plan, 60% of the total CapEx, or approximately EUR 3.1 billion, will be spent on the transport business, 30% on distribution and the remaining 10% on the storage business. As you know, we traditionally provide a 4 years CapEx plan as a solid estimation of our future spending. This is underpinned by the fact that around 75% of the overall spending is already authorized. \r\nLet's now focus on the project in the transport business. The project we are developing in Italy around EUR 3.1 billion over the plan period and will strengthen both import and export infrastructure, facilitating the establishment of future physical gas transit. With regards to export, the project will involve new pipeline developments in the Po Valley, 450 kilometers, two new compressor stations, 100 megawatt of installed power capacity as well as the empowerment of an existing station to allow for physical reverse flow in the pipelines. The overall investment dedicated to the north gas market and the creation of reverse flow capacity is around EUR 0.6 billion over the plan period. \r\nWith regard to imports, the key project in our plan is the South-North development. We plan to build pipelines of over 420 kilometers, which will increase the capacity at the southern entry points by around 8 bcm. This new project will be on stream by 2021, and will require the investment of around EUR 1.5 billion, of which EUR 0.1 billion in the plan period 2015-2018, mainly related to the engineering and permission activities. This project represents the bulk of the CapEx to be put in place after 2018, in order to complete the main development projects of the plan period. \r\nOur forecast for gas consumption in Italy shows an increase of around 1% per years for the period 2014-2025, largely driven by growth from the power generation sector of around 2.7%, while the industrial and residential and commercial sector are expected to be flat. \r\nCombined with the declining domestic production and growing export flows to Northern Europe, we expect import and transit volumes to significantly increase beyond 2020. The projects I have outlined in the previous slide ending but [ph] primarily devoted to consolidating the security of supply in each Italian region, taking into account the expected improvement in gas supply diversification, and therefore, change in our entry point are utilized.  \r\nFurthermore, this project pave the way for the development of greater export capacity. Specifically, our import project will increase the import capacity from 347 million standard cubic meter per day of gas in 2014 to around 370 million standard cubic meter per day beyond 2020. \r\nRegarding export to Northern Europe, the program is to boost export capacity from the current 24 million standard cubic meter per day to 46 million in 2018, mainly at Passo Gries, where we plan to create the capacity to export over 5 million standard cubic meter by 2015 to reach 40 million standard cubic meter by 2018. \r\nThese projects are well supported by the expected development of the Italian and European gas market dynamics, with Snam's gas transmission network increasingly playing a gas transit role. \r\nLooking at the storage business, the approximately -- the approximate EUR 0.5 billion of projects include in our investment plan should lead to an 11% increase in modulation capacity. This is expected to reach approximately 12.6 bcm in 2018 from the current 11.4 bcm, excluding strategic storage, which is currently the level of 4.5 bcm. The expected capacity development represents the completion of the project started in order to meet the requirements of the ministerial decree issued in 2010. \r\nIn addition, there will be an 80% increase in peak capacity, which is expected to reach more than 30 million cubic meter per day in 2018 compared to the 281 million cubic meter per day in 2014. These advances will increase the level of security and liquidity in the gas system. We are committed to providing new modulation services to all the shippers, which give them a growing level of short-cycle flexibility. \r\nFurthermore, we will support development of new services that allow for the integrated management of transport and storage capacities. \r\nLast but not least, this capacity development will also provide a sound base for the Italian storage system to participate as a central player in the potential pooling of existing and new gas security stock at European level.\r\nIn terms of the CapEx plan for the distribution business, our EUR 1.5 billion program is focused mainly on the network expansion and smart metering and will consolidate our revenues growth. We will invest in the replacement of some existing pipes, around 800 kilometers, in development of the distribution network by adding new line and by increasing the number of new connection on the existing distribution network, around 1,000 kilometers. We will also provide higher service quality and security across the network. The overall spending will reach approximately EUR 0.9 billion. \r\nRegarding smart metering, the investment program will also require the development of the relevant ICT hardware and software. The total CapEx for this project in the plan period is approximately EUR 450 million, representing around 30% of the total CapEx, and it will receive a higher remuneration under the current remuneration scheme. \r\nInvestment in the 4-year plan, together with the optimization of the concession portfolio, will bring the number of consolidated redelivery point to approximately EUR 6.6 million compared to the EUR 6.4 million redelivery point in 2014. \r\nLet me now briefly focus your attention on our strategy in the distribution business. Italian gas distribution underwent a market consolidation, as seen a few slides ago, and is now on the eve of a massive concessionary renewal. The newly adopted legislative framework should enable streamlined execution, thus, reducing administrative litigation and improve clarity. \r\nAs you know, this new scheme is now based on concession at area level, there are 177 gas areas, with standardized condition service, quality being one of the main granting criteria. The latest mille product [ph] decree imposes an extremely strict calendar, hence, most of the auctions will take place within the next 4 years.\r\nItalgas is today the market leader in Italy with 1/3 of the total market share. In addition, more than 75% of its current business is carried out in gas areas where it holds a relevant market share. The gas benefit from a competitive cost structure and strong cash flow generation, which grant us a significant return on investment. Leveraging its remarkable financial and operational competitive advantages, Italgas aims to unlock further value through the tender process of gas distribution concessions. The tender process will provide the opportunity to optimize the concession portfolio by moving from a fragmented geographic presence to concentrating on more uniform areas of operation, leveraging on synergies, economies of scale and applying its best practice in the newly acquired gas areas. \r\nValue creation will also be pursued through providing operational services to third-party network, granting us an additional stream of revenue in coming years. In a process characterized by transparency and efficiency [ph] rewards, Italgas aims to increase its current market share, gaining in terms of size and triggering further economies of scale. In the current plan, we are not considering significant additional financial commitment related to the consolidation process. We are monitoring the evolution of the tender process in order to capitalize all the opportunity that could arise to create further value.\r\nAs in 2014, over the next few years, we will work to develop new services to boost the liquidity of the gas market across 3 main work areas: capacity services, balancing regime and cooperation with gas exchanges. Let me give you some example of what we have already launched and of where we will focus on our work in the near future. \r\nWith reference to the new capacity services, we have implemented the new products envisaged by the European network code one year ahead of the enter into force of the provision, which is set on November 2015. The offer of the so-called bundled transmission capacity services allow for the transportation of gas between hubs via a single-capacity booking process, facilitating trading and arbitrage activities. \r\nWe are also working on the possibility to introduce short-cycle storage services in addition to the basic modulation services to address the increasing flexibility needs of users. \r\nFinally, we have proposed an incentive-based oversubscription and buyback scheme to offer additional capacity on a firm [ph] basis, in line with the EU regulation, which is now under evaluation by the regulator. \r\nConcerning the balancing regime, we have extended the balancing market to new flexibility sources, namely import and LNG, in addition to storage, and the new day-ahead balancing session has been introduced. We are in the process of implementing the EU balancing code, which will come into force in October 2015. In this framework, it is possible to envisage incentive scheme for the TSO in providing services aimed to support a better market functioning and to provide timely and accurate information to shippers regarding their daily commercial portfolio consumption. We are working to introduce incentive schemes in these areas. \r\nFinally, we are working intensively toward the evolution of the Italian gas system, and we have several cooperation activities ongoing with gas exchange operators for the development of future and spot gas market with physically delivery of the gas commodity. \r\nAs you already know, Snam is also shareholder in the new European platform, which was created to offer transmission capacity, in line with the future European rules, and which allows the commercial connection of the PSO to the main North European gas hubs. \r\nConsidering the key role that all the services and activities plays in the creation of the internal gas market, we are working with the relevant institution to introduce incentive scheme to exploit value not only for the gas system but also for Snam. We estimate that the services already identified and under discussion with the regulatory body could activate a potential new annual revenue stream up to EUR 40 million with meaningless related cost and capital employed within the current regulatory period. \r\nAlongside our investment priority and our international development, delivering operational efficiency is a key focus. Our track record in driving operational efficiency has been achieved across different regulatory periods by leveraging the proven experience that this company has in the cost of personnel, supply and services. This has resulted in a reduction of our controllable fixed cost by 5% in nominal terms, still allowing us to create value through operational efficiency. Such value creation is even more significant, if you consider that our operating activities showed a significant growth in transport infrastructure, storage capacity and in the number of distribution customers. \r\nOver the last few years, we are approaching a satisfactory level in terms of controllable cost. However, we will continue with our efficiency plan across the businesses. The target for our plan period aims to keeping the unit controllable fixed cost flat in real terms at constant parameters. This is a sound approach considering that we are currently running the fourth regulatory period across all our businesses. We have achieved a satisfactory cost base, and the current regulatory framework partially allows the recognition of the incremental cost related to the growing asset base. \r\nTo give you more evidence on how we would like to manage our cost base, we set some KPIs for our different businesses. In all of them, we plan to achieve unit controllable fixed cost flat in real terms in the next 4 years. The significant effort will well sustain our operating profitability line. \r\nNow let's move to Snam international development. Moving abroad, as you know, our international expansion strategy is very straightforward. Snam intends to play a significant role in the integration of the European gas infrastructure, focusing on the European gas corridor connected to the Italian infrastructure to best leverage on the strategic positioning of the Italian gas grid with respect to the future European gas flows. With this in mind, we commenced the journey to building a European platform by entering into strategic alliance with Fluxys, which resulted into reverse flow project from Italy to Germany and in the joint acquisition of a stake in Interconnector U.K.; acquiring a co-controlling stake of TIGF, currently is 40.5%, which is strategically positioned along the western leg of the European east-west gas corridor, and providing us further value-creation opportunities through the development of both a higher degree of market flexibility and integration in France and the interconnection of the French and Iberian markets with those of North Central Europe; and more recently in TAG, around 84.5%, which further strengthened the company's leading role amongst infrastructure operators in Europe, also thanks to its potential use in reverse flow towards Southern German and Central Europe markets. \r\nAll these transactions leave us very well-positioned to drive international growth. Our key objective are: to optimize return from the existing asset base; to coordinate CapEx and commercial activities within our cooperation with Fluxys in the North-South corridor; to focus on completing our exposure to our 2 target corridors, the North-South and the East-West corridors. \r\nI will now hand over to Antonio to further discussion on international development and financial efficiency.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Carlo. I will start with our international assets by analyzing the French market and TIGF's role. The current situation of the French market is not completely aligned with the European Union market integration's expectations. This is because France is divided into 3 different markets and balancing areas. To comply with the European guidelines and improve the liquidity of the French market, the regulator is promoting the creation of a single French marketplace in 2 different steps: step one, common TIGF, GRTgaz South Peg [ph] by 2015, merging the 2 market areas, 1 maintaining, 2 balancing point -- or points; step two, full integration of the French market to be achieved by 2018, and subject to the completion of new infrastructure, to reduce congestion between the zones. Clearly, from this change in the business environment, TIGF would benefit both in transmission and storage activities. \r\nStorage competitiveness, which is already remarkable as shown by the positive result of the year's commercial campaign, should further improve, thanks to the elimination of the current interconnection costs. There should be additional incentivized transmission investment to make the single French market a reality. The gas committee is already [indiscernible] investment decision. This CapEx was not included in the business plan of the acquisition and is already approved -- has been already approved by the French regulator. \r\nNew incentivized transport investment can also be envisaged to better interconnect the Spanish market. It is the MIDCAT project. The value creation of the asset has been recently proved by the investment base Crédit Agricole Assurance, which entered into the shareholder structure with a 10% stake, with an impact [ph] value for the 100% of the equity or more than EUR 1.8 billion. This shows the remarkable increase, around 40%, in terms of equity value compared to the valuation of the company at the time of the acquisition in 2013.\r\nOn TIGF, we are now targeting the yearly contribution to Snam's EPS, earnings per share, of around 2% over the plan period 2015-18. In addition, we confirm that we expect to repay more than 80% of our initial investment within 2023, with an equity IRR better than the low double-digit guidance we gave at the moment of the acquisition. \r\nTAG has an overall length of about 1,140 kilometers, and its operations are entirely subject to the Austrian regulation. The current regulatory period will last until the end of 2016. \r\nAnnual revenues largely derived from long-term ship-or-pay contracts expire in 2022, which ensures a high level of cash flow visibility. Leveraging on our proven track record in driving operational efficiency, we will also support TAG in the search of additional efficiencies. The share capital increase fully dedicated to such a big asset for the payment of TAG allows Snam to strengthen its capital structure and preserve its profitability. \r\nDespite the share capital increase, we expect the deal to be accretive starting from the first year and with an average -- an annual average 2%, 3% EPS accretion on the 4-year plan. \r\nIn addition, we confirm we expect to receive cumulative dividends up to around 90% of our initial investment for the equity within 2023. \r\nFinally, let me highlight that, also for the acquisition of TAG, in setting the price, we consider the minimum threshold for our targeted equity IRR at the level of the low double digit. \r\nLet me now give you some highlights on the expected growth of our nonconsolidated assets. In 2014, the contribution from our associates was EUR 79 million, of which [ph] from our international assets. As you can see from the chart, we expect, by 2018, a net income from associates surging to [indiscernible] EUR 30 million, 65% higher than 2004. This result is fueled primarily by both TAG and TIGF. Keep in mind that we acquired the residual stake of AES Torino as of July 1, 2014, and therefore, reducing the domestic contribution going forward. \r\nMoving to financial discipline. Let me now draw your attention to key themes, balance sheet solidity and financial efficiency. Starting from the soundness of our balance sheet, we expect our full year investment plan to be fully financed by our operating cash flow. This should allow us to maintain a strong balance sheet and support our commitment to protect group's solid credit worthiness. As for return [ph] metrics, we estimate a level of our net debt to asset in line with the current level. Also, if we consider the most severe adjustment carried out by the credit agencies, it remains below 55%. \r\nRegarding cash flow-based metrics, they are in the high end operating guidelines, benefiting also from the soundness, visibility and resilience of our cash flow generation. \r\nBut now let me spend a few words on our strong liquidity profile. The buffer -- our buffer is represented by around EUR 3 billion of undrawn committed credit facilities. Going forward, we reaffirm our commitment to a safe liquidity profile in the medium term to cover debt repayment schedule, to support a convenient approach in the debt capital market and to provide comfortable financial flexibility, while minimizing the cost related to undrawn committed lines. \r\nAs regards maturity and debt breakdown, we stick our goal to maintain the average maturity of our outstanding medium- to long-term debt at around 5 years and to have 2/3 of our debt at fixed rate. The last 2 factors are consistent with the mechanics of our tariff framework and our goal to protect our financial outperformance, align as much as possible debt duration with the regulatory view, frequency as a part on an appropriate asset and liability management approach, and locking today's cost-of-debt conditions in the medium-term, without keeping potential opportunity offered by the credit market. \r\nHaving said that, let me elaborate on the elements that are expected to be the 2 pillars of our equity story going forward, financial outperformance and flexibility. As regard the first, we believe that our refinancing needs in the future could turn into opportunities of further cost savings, thanks to the rollover of around EUR 5 billion of bonds over the plan period, of which EUR 4.5 billion at fixed rate, leveraging on the remarkable fall in interest rates and credit spreads experienced in the last few years, with an average savings well in excess of 200 basis point for the potential new issues versus the expiring ones; and secondly, a proactive and opportunistic attitude in the treasury management optimization and banking lines renegotiations, leveraging on long-lasting relationship with the core banks and favorable market condition. \r\nMoreover, we expect to benefit from a wide portfolio of infrastructures projects potentially eligible for institutional financing, which represent a competitive source of funding versus bank and the capital market in terms of both tenure and cost. \r\nFinally, please also take into account that 2015 will record the full year effect of the optimization measures carried out in the second half of 2014. As a result, based on the current market condition, we expect the cost of our debt for 2015 to average around 2.9%.\r\nNow let's comment about the restoration on our financial flexibilities -- flexibility achieved, thanks to: firstly, the considerable financial expenses reduction, as I said before, then the equity-based acquisition of TAG at year end 2014 with a positive impact both of Snam metrics and its overall credit worthiness; and then -- and thirdly, the consolidation of the Robin Hood tax from 2015 with an estimate positive impact of EUR 90 million in 2015. \r\nFinally, the selected investment in accordance with the evolution of the gas market needs. This financial flexibility is expected to support our equity story, based on an attractive and sustainable return for shareholders, while at the same time, preserving the low-risk profile of the group's financial structure, the capability to capture potential opportunities, and the opportunistic and proactive approach in our future refinancing actions.\r\nNow I hand you over to Carlo for the final remarks.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Antonio. Why is Snam able to provide an attractive and sustainable shareholder return? Because we have reliable results fueled by new potential stream of revenues, a solid balance sheet, and we constantly seek operational and financial efficiency. In this presentation, we have outlined the adaptability of our asset portfolio that the management team and I will exploit with selective and disciplined investment to create value, bringing a steady flow of growth even in a tough environment. Furthermore, the soundness of our balance sheet remains of utmost importance, and the cash flow generated by our operating activity during the plan period is expected to fund our asset growth, thus, providing us the possibility to maintain the leverage within 55%. \r\nSnam value creation is and will be supported by the increasing contribution of nonconsolidated international associates, which are expected to post remarkable growth at the net income contribution in the plan period. \r\nWe are progressing in our path to increase the flexibility of the overall gas system by developing new services for our customers. This will open up a new potential stream of revenues to further support the soundness of our result, without forgetting that we remain committed to exploiting operating and financial efficiency in order to further strengthen our overall performance. \r\nLast but not least, it's worth noting, they restore financial flexibly as a result of our solid cash flow generation and rigorous financial discipline. All these feed our dividend policy aimed at paying a sustainable and attractive dividend. For the fiscal year 2015, we confirm that we intend to distribute EUR 0.25 per share. \r\nWe are entering a year of uncertainty due to the upcoming medium-term regulatory review, therefore, we do not consider it appropriate to set medium-term dividend policy, but is in our ultimate goal to maintain sound return for our shareholder. \r\nWe are ready to answer any questions you may have, please.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Carlo Malacarne (Executives)】\nOkay. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us. Today, we will walk you through 2014 results and the strategy update over the next 4 years. Today's presentation will be started in 3 parts. First, I will start by outlining the main highlights of 2014. Antonio will then focus on our 2014 consolidated results. Finally, we will discuss our 2015, 2018 strategy and targets. \r\nLet me begin with the main highlights for the full year 2014 as well as providing you with an update on the business. We are pleased once again to report a solid set of result for 2014, achieved despite a tough and challenging environment. Snam's sound operating performance over the period is reflected by the EUR 3.6 billion of revenues and the EUR 2.8 billion of EBITDA, both at similar level to 2013. This is a remarkable result considering that 2014 is the first year of the full regulatory period for transmission, regasification and distribution businesses. The significant increase of 30.6% in net profit is the combined result of: firstly, lower interest expenses during the period, mostly reflecting the significant reduction in our average cost of debt. Antonio will share all the details in a moment. Secondly, higher contribution from our associates, highlighting the sound return of our European investments. And finally, the reduction of the tax rate as well as the nonrecurring effect related to the recalculation of the fair taxes due to the Robin Hood tax cancellation. All these elements allowed us to reach reported net income of around EUR 1.2 billion, a remarkable increase of 30.6% versus 2013. \r\nTurning to our growth path. Our investments are aimed at increasing the flexibility, liquidity and security of both the Italian and the European system, enhancing gas flows and interconnectivity of EU markets. In 2014, we deployed total investment of approximately EUR 1.8 billion. Around EUR 1.3 billion was attributed to CapEx for infrastructure development in Italy, in line with the guidance provided at the beginning of the year. And around EUR 500 million to finance -- to financial investment for the acquisition of the 8 -- 89.2% [ph] equity interest in TAG. Consistent with our strict financial discipline, the CapEx were covered by the operating cash flow, which reached a sound level of around EUR 1.5 billion. It has allowed us to maintain a solid balance sheet with the net financial debt of EUR 13.6 billion, up by EUR 300 million compared to year-end 2013. This is a significant result considering the EUR 1.8 billion of investments carried out during the year. \r\nThe acquisition of TAG strengthens Snam's leading role amongst infrastructure operators in Europe. It allow us to manage a strategic asset for the development of the European East-West energy corridor, encouraging increased integration of continental energy networks, in part due to its potential use in a reverse flow toward the Central Europe markets. In the same gas corridor, we have an update of TIGF. At the end of February 2015, Snam and its partners finalized the entry of a Credit Agricole Assurances into the share capital of TIGF with a 10% stake. \r\nSnam received slightly over EUR 80 million implying a value of more than EUR 1.8 billion for the 100% of the equity. This represent an approximately 40% increase compared to the total equity value at the time of the acquisition of TIGF. This illustrates the value added by our management of the company carried out in less than 2 years. \r\nAs you know, Snam has consistently been committed to delivering sustainable and attractive returns to its shareholders. On the basis of 2014 sound results and considering our solid capital structure, the Board of Directors yesterday decided to propose at the Annual General Meeting, a dividend distribution of EUR 0.25 per share for the fiscal year 2014, thus, confirming our announced dividend policy. The fiscal year 2014 dividend, subject to the approval at the shareholder meeting, results in a dividend yield of around 6% at the top range of the utility sector. \r\nI will now hand over to Antonio, who will discuss our 2014 consolidated result in more detail.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Antonio Paccioretti (Executives)】\nThank you, Carlo, and good afternoon, everyone. 2014 Snam's results were characterized by some relevant events: first year of a new regulatory period for transport, regasification and distribution activities; low gas demand; the consolidation starting from July 1, 2014, AES Torino, the gas distribution company operating in Turin; the Robin Tax that in 2014 decreased from 10.5% to 6.5%, and in 2015 has been considered generating a one-off positive adjustment of EUR 120 million to deferred  tax fund. Moreover, at the end of 2014, we have finalized through dedicated capital increase, the interest acquisition in TAG, which will contribute to consolidated results starting from 2015. \r\nLooking at 2014 consolidated income statement. EBIT amounted to EUR 1,973 million. The resilience of regulated revenues in the first year of the new regulatory period and the strict control of operating costs have supported 2014 results, that reached a level substantially in line with the previous year. On a like-for-like basis, not taking into consideration some one-off item accounting in 2013 and '14, that would be discussed later on. \r\nEBIT showed a slight decrease of approximately 0.4%. Net profit grew by around 31% to EUR 1,188 million, benefiting from the significant reduction in our average cost of debt, reflecting the debt optimization measures carried out so far, the increase in incomes from associates, driven by the positive contribution of TIGF and a nonrecurring positive item related to the equity interest in AES Torino and the positive effect related to the Robin Tax due to both its reduction to 6.5% in 2014 and to the positive adjustment of deferred tax fund for EUR 120 million following its cancellation starting from this year. 2014 adjusted net profit, net of deferred tax fund adjustment recorded an increase of around 50%. \r\n2014 total revenues amounted to EUR 3,566 million, showing an increase of EUR 37 million. Regulated revenues, net of pass-through components increased by EUR 37 million, up 1.1% compared to 2013, reflecting the following contributions by business segment. Transport revenues marked an increase of EUR 17 million. Deposit contribution from the investment carried out in 2012 equaled to EUR 86 million, was partially balanced by the tariff adjustment of the new regulatory period of EUR 60 million and the effect of the decrease of gas injected into the network of around EUR 9 million. \r\nDistribution revenues grew by EUR 9 million. The growth is the result of the slight reduction in regulated revenues following the new regulatory period and the contribution of the consolidation of AES Torino from July 1 equal to EUR 37 million. Storage revenues increased by EUR 14 million, mainly due to the contribution of the investment carried out in 2012. The decrease in pass-through revenues was mainly due to the overall gas transport system balancing services. Other revenues amounted to EUR 60 million, an increase of EUR 22 million compared to the previous year. \r\nMoving to operating expenses. Total cost in 2014 amounted to EUR 790 million. Net of pass-through components, operating costs were equal to EUR 673 million, recording an increase of EUR 86 million, mainly related to some one-off risk fund provisions of EUR 95 million accounted among other costs. Controllable fixed costs in 2014 amounted to EUR 471 million, an increase limited to EUR 11 million compared to 2013, mainly due to the incremental cost for the consolidation of AES Torino of around EUR 8 million. Considering the same parameter of business, controllable fixed cost result substantially flat in nominal terms confirming our continuous attention to cost control and the capability to achieve efficiency targets. \r\nVariable costs reduced by EUR 10 million, mainly in the distribution business due to the energy efficiency certificates. Other costs equal to EUR 154 million, increased by EUR 89 million due to the above-mentioned one-off risk fund provision of EUR 95 million. No impact on the cash flow, for sure. EUR 75 million referred to the balancing activities accounted for in 2012 both in the transport and storage segments, and EUR 20 million were relative to some local infrastructure in the distribution business. Nonregulated costs amounting to EUR 40 million decreased by EUR 4 million, mainly in the distribution business. \r\nMoving to the cost breakdown by business. Net of pass-through costs, we accounted the growth of EUR 42 million in the transport business and of EUR 27 million in the storage business, both related to the risk fund provisions. Consolidated EBIT amounted to EUR 1,973 million, with a decrease of EUR 61 million. Net of one-off item, EBIT remained substantially flat, with the growth of approximately 0.4% on a like-for-like basis as a result of the increase in regulated revenues of EUR 37 million, the increase in controllable fixed costs of EUR 11 million, the increase in depreciation and amortization for EUR 34 million mainly due to the new asset enter into operation for EUR 14 million, the change of certain assets' technical life in the distribution business according to the new regulatory framework for about EUR 12 million and for the remaining part to the consolidation of AES Torino from July 2014. \r\nFinally, other positive effects of EUR 16 million, mainly reflecting the reduction in variable cost and the positive contribution from nonregulated activities. \r\nIn terms of business segments, net of one-off items, let us underline the positive contribution of storage reporting an EBIT growth of EUR 30 million, up 9.4%. The transport business growing of about EUR 13 million, up 1.1%. The distribution segment registered an EBIT decrease of EUR 19 million, down 3.7% mainly due to the slight reduction in the regulated revenues following the new regulatory period. \r\nGiven the significant and growing contribution granted by our nonconsolidated associates, it's worth underlining their results in terms of both impact on income and our cash flow. Net income from associates amounted to EUR 131 million, recorded an increase of EUR 86 million, mainly due to the higher equity contribution of TIGF, EUR 51 million, that, as you know, last year was negatively affected by a tax burden related to the acquisition. And secondly, the consolidation of AES Torino from July 2014, which has 2 effects. Firstly, its equity contribution is limited to the first 6 months of the year. Secondly, the transaction generated a one-off positive effect from the restatement of the equity interest at its fair value. As far as cash dividends are concerned, in 2014, they amounted to EUR 99 million, recording an increase of EUR 29 million, essentially related to TIGF. \r\nNow I would like to conclude the review of our income statement further commenting the net profit performance. Net profit in 2014 was EUR 1,198 million, up 30.6% compared to the previous year. Net profit adjusted for the special item increased by 15.4%. 2013 net profit was adjusted for the net effect of the early retirement plan, EUR 17 million. While 2014 net profit is adjusted for the effect of deferred tax fund following the Robin Hood tax consolidation. Analyzing the item below EBIT, net profit growth has been supported by: firstly, the reduction in interest expenses of EUR 75 million, mainly due to a lower average cost of debt that benefited from the significant debt optimization measures carried out so far, partially offset by the higher average outstanding debt and some upfront fees accounted last year following the repayment in advance of a term loan financing subscribed in 2012. Details on debt structure and cost of debt evolution will be provided in the following slide. Secondly, the net profit growth was supported by the already commented increase in net income from associates of EUR 86 million. Finally, we accounted the reduction of the tax credit to around 37%, mainly due to the decrease in 2014 of the Robin Tax from the rate of -- to the rate of 6.5%. \r\nMoving on to the results of the 2014 debt optimization exercise. The main actions executed may be summarized as follows. New recourse [ph] to debt capital market, both via publications and via private placements for a total amount of 1,075,000,000 -- EUR 1,750,000,000 exploiting favorable market conditions and the compressions of Snam's spread in the debt capital market. As a result -- as regards banking facilities, in 2014, Snam showed a proactive approach performing in advance pool and bilateral banking facilities refinancing for an overall amount of around EUR 5 billion in order to extend the maturity and reduce the cost of the lines. Disintermediation of certain European investment bank financing for around EUR 300 million with a significant cost savings of -- following cost savings. Growing role of uncommitted credit lines, debt reached more than EUR 1 billion at the end of the year, leveraging on abundant market liquidity and recent central bank actions. It is worth stressing the fact that the actions carried out in 2014 are in line with our financial strategy and achievement, consistent with our targets. In 2014, cost of debt decreased to around 3.2% versus 3.7% of the last year. The fixed-rate portion is 69% in line with our plan to have around 2/3 of our debt at fixed rate. The maturity profile is well spread over time avoiding major concentration issues going forward and without banking refinancing until 2017, with an average maturity of around 5 years. The strong liquidity profile covers 24-month maturities. \r\nIn 2014, Snam confirmed once more its strong capability in the cash flow generation that reached the level of about EUR 1.8 billion. The working capital absorption of EUR 275 million was mainly related to the tax payment of about EUR 135 million due to 2013 tax balance of about EUR 88 million, and 2014 advance payments higher than the tax accrued in the year of EUR 47 million. For the remaining part, to nonstructured payable accounted at the year-end 2013 and paid at the beginning of 2014. \r\nMoving to net investments. Snam confirmed also in 2014 its growth strategy fueled by a level of net investment higher than EUR 1.7 million -- billion, of which EUR 1.2 billion related to CapEx in the regulated business in Italy and EUR 0.5 billion referred to the TAG acquisition, which, as you know, was fully financed through a dedicated capital increase. The result is a 2014 positive free cash flow close to EUR 300 million. Given the evolution of the cash flow from operation and net investment already commented, net financial debt at the year end 2014 amounted to EUR 13,652 million, well in line with our targets. The debt increase of EUR 356 million compared to the year end 2013, was related to the AES Torino debt consolidation and to the payment of 2013 dividend balance. \r\nTurning to the balance sheet. Fixed assets increased by EUR 1.2 billion versus year end 2013 as a result of CapEx realized in Italy, the TAG acquisition and the consolidation of AES Torino for a total amount of EUR 2 billion, partially offset by assets depreciation of EUR 0.8 billion. \r\nIn conclusion, coming to the leverage, the growth of our asset base together with our strict financial discipline, allowed us to achieve a ratio of debt to total RAB and associates of around 52% compared to 53% recorded in 2013. \r\nThat's all for me. I will now hand over to Carlo for the strategic plan 2015-18.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Carlo Malacarne (Executives)】\nThank you, Antonio. Let me now walk you through 2015-2018 strategy and target. Our goal of achieving sustainable returns and profitable growth will be attained through a focus on 4 strategic priorities that preserve our low risk profile.  First, disciplined management of investment opportunities will allow us to exploit the optionality of our asset portfolio through capitalizing on high-quality growth opportunities in Italy, focusing on 2 main European gas corridor, the East-West and the North-South corridors to integrate and complement our asset portfolio as well as to diversify our country and regulatory risk. Second, we will continuously improve our operational management. This will be accomplished by progressing towards obtaining the role of market facilitator, providing integrated services to shippers and final customers. We will also continue to control costs. Third, pursue sound financial discipline through investing in value-additive CapEx as well as consolidating our solid and efficient capital structure. M&A activity will be selective and aimed at returns' accretion. Drive value for all of our stakeholders through profitable and steady growth even in a low-inflation environment. We will continue to pay a sustainable dividend, thereby delivering attractive shareholder returns. \r\nStarting with the business environment. I would like to draw your attention to the following main trends in the European gas market. Gas demand in Europe is expected to remain almost flat over the coming decades. However, this would not imply a static marketplace as a decline in the regions' gas reserves and production, particularly in North Sea, will increase Europe's net gas imports from around 65% of total demand in 2013 to a remarkable 75% in 2030. And this import deficit will be geographically imbalanced, the highest import needs being contracted -- concentrated in North Europe. Overall, Europe will become more dependent on non-EU sources, Russia, Middle East, North Africa with an important new contribution by the Caspian region where most gas reserves are concentrated. This market development will generate a significant shift in EU  internal gas flows with Southern EU becoming a crucial entry point for additional import flows.  Furthermore, there is a growing need to balance peaks in gas demand due to its increasing volatility as intermittent renewable energy sources need to be backed up by production in gas fuel combined cycle. These peaks, which require intensive availability of transport and storage capacity, are increasingly uncorrelated to the overall trend in gas demand. This trend imply the need to build out gas infrastructure to facilitate the matching between imported gas and gas demand as well as to integrate gas market to efficiently balance supply and demand. \r\nThe European natural gas industry is being challenged by several factors beyond the global economic downturn and competition in the energy production market. The market is still looking for the right equilibrium between new market needs and security of supply. This is the big challenge for years to come. Along the gas chain, we can observe a re-definition of long-term established roles. Upstream players are willing to get closer to the consumer market, thus, bypassing the traditional gas importers. The latter will also face increasing competition brought by traders and by final consumers. All this translate into a higher degree of volatility in the market. This will become even more evident with more gas supply contracts being renegotiated and linked to the gas spot market rather than to long-term contracts. \r\nOn the other hand, it's important to stress that the complete cancellation of the take-or-pay contracts may become an issue as it affected the security of supply that remain a priority at European level, particularly considering high dependence of single-supply sources and political instability of certain exporters. Infrastructure availability will need to change accordingly and be much more flexible than in the past. Its development will no longer be driven only by the growth of gas demand, but will be required to improve the security of supply, enable the integration of domestic market into a single European marketplace, connected to the highest number of supply sources and provide efficient services encouraging energy price competition versus cheaper but more polluting fuel like oil. \r\nAdditional transmission system and storage facility will have to be developed to cope with highly volatile demand providing the required peak capacity to ensure a secure, reliable and sustainable response to the needs of consumers. Storage is the main resource to tackle potential gas flow shortages. Institution and the regulators should work together to design appropriate measure to pool parts of existing and new gas security stock at European level, ensuring the full utilization and further development of a strategic storage for the continent. This would be possible under several conditions: a common set of rule to establish transit condition of gas from the countries where storage is physically located to consumption site; and an international body able to coordinate specific rule and condition for the use of strategic storage; the debottlenecking of national gas grid; and the availability of reserve flow capacity at cross-border interconnection points. \r\nThe European gas market is characterized by a number of challenges, which can only be addressed by the creation of an interconnected pan-European gas network to diversify gas sourcing and increase the security of supply as well as to foster the flexibility. The integration of European gas network will be supported by the development of efficient and bidirectional cross-border gas corridors. This is the key to guaranteeing security of supply, enhancing competition of the gas market and promoting a smooth transition for an efficient and sustainable low-carbon economy. \r\nInfrastructure operators needed to design sustainable investment strategy to capture the opportunities generated by the rapidly changing business environment. Their role is evolving from being a mere asset owner, simply managing infrastructure to market facilitator providing innovative integrated services to shippers and final customers. At the same time, the availability of market-responsive services to meet the evolving needs of shippers and final customers, in particular, in terms of flexibility and service integration, is becoming increasingly crucial. A more flexible and shipper-friendly commercial offer and the implementation of common rules are necessary to promote the efficient functioning of the market to foster its liquidity and to preserve the security of supply. Specifically, more advanced commercial offer will aim at an integrated offer for -- of transport, storage and LNG services, with the latter more focused on short-term requirements; a higher degree of consistency between capacity and volume transported, supporting shippers in the optimization of their logistic portfolio. The development of new activities would allow an optimal access and utilization of the gas system by traders and shippers, thus, improving their performance. This will translate into revenue and investment sustainable for infrastructure operator. \r\nLet me now briefly focus your attention on Italy and specifically, on the distribution industry. From the chart, you can see that the Italian distribution market is still very fragmented between many small operators. The result is that the whole system works at a suboptimal level of efficiency. The recently completed legislative framework is expected to further enhance the consolidation process and increase the efficiency of the distribution through the substantial enlargement of concession areas to seek economy of scale, implying their significant reduction in number; a set of standard rules for the tender process based on economic conditions and parameters on security and quality of the services. The new business environment represents an important opportunity for Italgas as a leading, highly competitive and nationwide position player in the Italian market to unlock additional value. \r\nLet's now focus on how Snam can develop its strategy in this evolving environment. Let's start with our investment priorities. Snam's CapEx plan has to be analyzed in the context of the changing market environment we just described, which provides us with the optionality to pursue growth opportunity with a long-term vision. In order to support the development of the Italian/European gas market, gas network will have to guarantee high level of security, flexibility and liquidity. This will be achieved through the creation of substantial transport and storage capacity in Italy, including additional capacity to allow for the physical reverse flow of gas from Italy to other European countries, paving the way towards connecting North African countries, the new Caspian area and Eastern Mediterranean gas sources to Continental Europe. In particular, in the transport business, capital expenditure is devoted to meeting capacity requirements and to providing supply source diversification to the shippers. This development should facilitate not only a higher level of security and flexibility of the gas system, but also gas transit to European market via the reverse flow of gas from Italy to other countries. \r\nMoving on to storage. Our substantial investment program has been designed to guarantee greater storage capacity in the gas system both in terms of modulation and peak capacity, optimizing the balance of the overall system. At the same time, by increasing capacity, we can create a favorable condition for the development of higher liquidity in the gas system. This will set the path for  facilitating the use of our storage system for gas swap opportunities as well as to pull it for security purpose at the EU level in coming years. \r\nWith regards to the distribution business, investment will be focused on the development of new distribution networks, mainly in South of Italy and on the smart metering project, which will allow Italgas to guarantee a high level of service quality. More importantly, the new legislative framework, Italgas will both exploit consolidation opportunities and will begin optimizing its portfolio and concession, which we will discuss in further detail later on. \r\nThe plan for CapEx in Italy is EUR 5.1 billion over the next 4 years, which will support an estimated 1% annual growth in our consolidated regulatory asset base by 2018, starting from the 2014 estimated base just below EUR 25 million. We plan to manage the pace and timing of our investment to maintain our track record of profitable growth, improving capital efficiency and returns. The change versus the previous 4-year CapEx plan is mainly due to the shifting of spending related to the certain investment in the south of Italy in order to match the capacity need related to the TAP project as well as to the completion of some development project for the new storage capacity. \r\nIn 2015, we expect to invest EUR 1.3 billion, with the remaining EUR 3.8 billion to be spread over the remainder of the plan period. Furthermore, we will consolidate the profitability of our asset base, leveraging the incentive scheme set by the authority. With around 70% of total investment incentivized, with higher remuneration, the share of the overall RAB benefiting from incentivized remuneration will account for an average 1/3 of the total for the plan period. \r\nOver the 4-year business plan, 60% of the total CapEx, or approximately EUR 3.1 billion, will be spent on the transport business, 30% on distribution and the remaining 10% on the storage business. As you know, we traditionally provide a 4 years CapEx plan as a solid estimation of our future spending. This is underpinned by the fact that around 75% of the overall spending is already authorized. \r\nLet's now focus on the project in the transport business. The project we are developing in Italy around EUR 3.1 billion over the plan period and will strengthen both import and export infrastructure, facilitating the establishment of future physical gas transit. With regards to export, the project will involve new pipeline developments in the Po Valley, 450 kilometers, two new compressor stations, 100 megawatt of installed power capacity as well as the empowerment of an existing station to allow for physical reverse flow in the pipelines. The overall investment dedicated to the north gas market and the creation of reverse flow capacity is around EUR 0.6 billion over the plan period. \r\nWith regard to imports, the key project in our plan is the South-North development. We plan to build pipelines of over 420 kilometers, which will increase the capacity at the southern entry points by around 8 bcm. This new project will be on stream by 2021, and will require the investment of around EUR 1.5 billion, of which EUR 0.1 billion in the plan period 2015-2018, mainly related to the engineering and permission activities. This project represents the bulk of the CapEx to be put in place after 2018, in order to complete the main development projects of the plan period. \r\nOur forecast for gas consumption in Italy shows an increase of around 1% per years for the period 2014-2025, largely driven by growth from the power generation sector of around 2.7%, while the industrial and residential and commercial sector are expected to be flat. \r\nCombined with the declining domestic production and growing export flows to Northern Europe, we expect import and transit volumes to significantly increase beyond 2020. The projects I have outlined in the previous slide ending but [ph] primarily devoted to consolidating the security of supply in each Italian region, taking into account the expected improvement in gas supply diversification, and therefore, change in our entry point are utilized.  \r\nFurthermore, this project pave the way for the development of greater export capacity. Specifically, our import project will increase the import capacity from 347 million standard cubic meter per day of gas in 2014 to around 370 million standard cubic meter per day beyond 2020. \r\nRegarding export to Northern Europe, the program is to boost export capacity from the current 24 million standard cubic meter per day to 46 million in 2018, mainly at Passo Gries, where we plan to create the capacity to export over 5 million standard cubic meter by 2015 to reach 40 million standard cubic meter by 2018. \r\nThese projects are well supported by the expected development of the Italian and European gas market dynamics, with Snam's gas transmission network increasingly playing a gas transit role. \r\nLooking at the storage business, the approximately -- the approximate EUR 0.5 billion of projects include in our investment plan should lead to an 11% increase in modulation capacity. This is expected to reach approximately 12.6 bcm in 2018 from the current 11.4 bcm, excluding strategic storage, which is currently the level of 4.5 bcm. The expected capacity development represents the completion of the project started in order to meet the requirements of the ministerial decree issued in 2010. \r\nIn addition, there will be an 80% increase in peak capacity, which is expected to reach more than 30 million cubic meter per day in 2018 compared to the 281 million cubic meter per day in 2014. These advances will increase the level of security and liquidity in the gas system. We are committed to providing new modulation services to all the shippers, which give them a growing level of short-cycle flexibility. \r\nFurthermore, we will support development of new services that allow for the integrated management of transport and storage capacities. \r\nLast but not least, this capacity development will also provide a sound base for the Italian storage system to participate as a central player in the potential pooling of existing and new gas security stock at European level.\r\nIn terms of the CapEx plan for the distribution business, our EUR 1.5 billion program is focused mainly on the network expansion and smart metering and will consolidate our revenues growth. We will invest in the replacement of some existing pipes, around 800 kilometers, in development of the distribution network by adding new line and by increasing the number of new connection on the existing distribution network, around 1,000 kilometers. We will also provide higher service quality and security across the network. The overall spending will reach approximately EUR 0.9 billion. \r\nRegarding smart metering, the investment program will also require the development of the relevant ICT hardware and software. The total CapEx for this project in the plan period is approximately EUR 450 million, representing around 30% of the total CapEx, and it will receive a higher remuneration under the current remuneration scheme. \r\nInvestment in the 4-year plan, together with the optimization of the concession portfolio, will bring the number of consolidated redelivery point to approximately EUR 6.6 million compared to the EUR 6.4 million redelivery point in 2014. \r\nLet me now briefly focus your attention on our strategy in the distribution business. Italian gas distribution underwent a market consolidation, as seen a few slides ago, and is now on the eve of a massive concessionary renewal. The newly adopted legislative framework should enable streamlined execution, thus, reducing administrative litigation and improve clarity. \r\nAs you know, this new scheme is now based on concession at area level, there are 177 gas areas, with standardized condition service, quality being one of the main granting criteria. The latest mille product [ph] decree imposes an extremely strict calendar, hence, most of the auctions will take place within the next 4 years.\r\nItalgas is today the market leader in Italy with 1/3 of the total market share. In addition, more than 75% of its current business is carried out in gas areas where it holds a relevant market share. The gas benefit from a competitive cost structure and strong cash flow generation, which grant us a significant return on investment. Leveraging its remarkable financial and operational competitive advantages, Italgas aims to unlock further value through the tender process of gas distribution concessions. The tender process will provide the opportunity to optimize the concession portfolio by moving from a fragmented geographic presence to concentrating on more uniform areas of operation, leveraging on synergies, economies of scale and applying its best practice in the newly acquired gas areas. \r\nValue creation will also be pursued through providing operational services to third-party network, granting us an additional stream of revenue in coming years. In a process characterized by transparency and efficiency [ph] rewards, Italgas aims to increase its current market share, gaining in terms of size and triggering further economies of scale. In the current plan, we are not considering significant additional financial commitment related to the consolidation process. We are monitoring the evolution of the tender process in order to capitalize all the opportunity that could arise to create further value.\r\nAs in 2014, over the next few years, we will work to develop new services to boost the liquidity of the gas market across 3 main work areas: capacity services, balancing regime and cooperation with gas exchanges. Let me give you some example of what we have already launched and of where we will focus on our work in the near future. \r\nWith reference to the new capacity services, we have implemented the new products envisaged by the European network code one year ahead of the enter into force of the provision, which is set on November 2015. The offer of the so-called bundled transmission capacity services allow for the transportation of gas between hubs via a single-capacity booking process, facilitating trading and arbitrage activities. \r\nWe are also working on the possibility to introduce short-cycle storage services in addition to the basic modulation services to address the increasing flexibility needs of users. \r\nFinally, we have proposed an incentive-based oversubscription and buyback scheme to offer additional capacity on a firm [ph] basis, in line with the EU regulation, which is now under evaluation by the regulator. \r\nConcerning the balancing regime, we have extended the balancing market to new flexibility sources, namely import and LNG, in addition to storage, and the new day-ahead balancing session has been introduced. We are in the process of implementing the EU balancing code, which will come into force in October 2015. In this framework, it is possible to envisage incentive scheme for the TSO in providing services aimed to support a better market functioning and to provide timely and accurate information to shippers regarding their daily commercial portfolio consumption. We are working to introduce incentive schemes in these areas. \r\nFinally, we are working intensively toward the evolution of the Italian gas system, and we have several cooperation activities ongoing with gas exchange operators for the development of future and spot gas market with physically delivery of the gas commodity. \r\nAs you already know, Snam is also shareholder in the new European platform, which was created to offer transmission capacity, in line with the future European rules, and which allows the commercial connection of the PSO to the main North European gas hubs. \r\nConsidering the key role that all the services and activities plays in the creation of the internal gas market, we are working with the relevant institution to introduce incentive scheme to exploit value not only for the gas system but also for Snam. We estimate that the services already identified and under discussion with the regulatory body could activate a potential new annual revenue stream up to EUR 40 million with meaningless related cost and capital employed within the current regulatory period. \r\nAlongside our investment priority and our international development, delivering operational efficiency is a key focus. Our track record in driving operational efficiency has been achieved across different regulatory periods by leveraging the proven experience that this company has in the cost of personnel, supply and services. This has resulted in a reduction of our controllable fixed cost by 5% in nominal terms, still allowing us to create value through operational efficiency. Such value creation is even more significant, if you consider that our operating activities showed a significant growth in transport infrastructure, storage capacity and in the number of distribution customers. \r\nOver the last few years, we are approaching a satisfactory level in terms of controllable cost. However, we will continue with our efficiency plan across the businesses. The target for our plan period aims to keeping the unit controllable fixed cost flat in real terms at constant parameters. This is a sound approach considering that we are currently running the fourth regulatory period across all our businesses. We have achieved a satisfactory cost base, and the current regulatory framework partially allows the recognition of the incremental cost related to the growing asset base. \r\nTo give you more evidence on how we would like to manage our cost base, we set some KPIs for our different businesses. In all of them, we plan to achieve unit controllable fixed cost flat in real terms in the next 4 years. The significant effort will well sustain our operating profitability line. \r\nNow let's move to Snam international development. Moving abroad, as you know, our international expansion strategy is very straightforward. Snam intends to play a significant role in the integration of the European gas infrastructure, focusing on the European gas corridor connected to the Italian infrastructure to best leverage on the strategic positioning of the Italian gas grid with respect to the future European gas flows. With this in mind, we commenced the journey to building a European platform by entering into strategic alliance with Fluxys, which resulted into reverse flow project from Italy to Germany and in the joint acquisition of a stake in Interconnector U.K.; acquiring a co-controlling stake of TIGF, currently is 40.5%, which is strategically positioned along the western leg of the European east-west gas corridor, and providing us further value-creation opportunities through the development of both a higher degree of market flexibility and integration in France and the interconnection of the French and Iberian markets with those of North Central Europe; and more recently in TAG, around 84.5%, which further strengthened the company's leading role amongst infrastructure operators in Europe, also thanks to its potential use in reverse flow towards Southern German and Central Europe markets. \r\nAll these transactions leave us very well-positioned to drive international growth. Our key objective are: to optimize return from the existing asset base; to coordinate CapEx and commercial activities within our cooperation with Fluxys in the North-South corridor; to focus on completing our exposure to our 2 target corridors, the North-South and the East-West corridors. \r\nI will now hand over to Antonio to further discussion on international development and financial efficiency.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Antonio Paccioretti (Executives)】\nThank you, Carlo. I will start with our international assets by analyzing the French market and TIGF's role. The current situation of the French market is not completely aligned with the European Union market integration's expectations. This is because France is divided into 3 different markets and balancing areas. To comply with the European guidelines and improve the liquidity of the French market, the regulator is promoting the creation of a single French marketplace in 2 different steps: step one, common TIGF, GRTgaz South Peg [ph] by 2015, merging the 2 market areas, 1 maintaining, 2 balancing point -- or points; step two, full integration of the French market to be achieved by 2018, and subject to the completion of new infrastructure, to reduce congestion between the zones. Clearly, from this change in the business environment, TIGF would benefit both in transmission and storage activities. \r\nStorage competitiveness, which is already remarkable as shown by the positive result of the year's commercial campaign, should further improve, thanks to the elimination of the current interconnection costs. There should be additional incentivized transmission investment to make the single French market a reality. The gas committee is already [indiscernible] investment decision. This CapEx was not included in the business plan of the acquisition and is already approved -- has been already approved by the French regulator. \r\nNew incentivized transport investment can also be envisaged to better interconnect the Spanish market. It is the MIDCAT project. The value creation of the asset has been recently proved by the investment base Crédit Agricole Assurance, which entered into the shareholder structure with a 10% stake, with an impact [ph] value for the 100% of the equity or more than EUR 1.8 billion. This shows the remarkable increase, around 40%, in terms of equity value compared to the valuation of the company at the time of the acquisition in 2013.\r\nOn TIGF, we are now targeting the yearly contribution to Snam's EPS, earnings per share, of around 2% over the plan period 2015-18. In addition, we confirm that we expect to repay more than 80% of our initial investment within 2023, with an equity IRR better than the low double-digit guidance we gave at the moment of the acquisition. \r\nTAG has an overall length of about 1,140 kilometers, and its operations are entirely subject to the Austrian regulation. The current regulatory period will last until the end of 2016. \r\nAnnual revenues largely derived from long-term ship-or-pay contracts expire in 2022, which ensures a high level of cash flow visibility. Leveraging on our proven track record in driving operational efficiency, we will also support TAG in the search of additional efficiencies. The share capital increase fully dedicated to such a big asset for the payment of TAG allows Snam to strengthen its capital structure and preserve its profitability. \r\nDespite the share capital increase, we expect the deal to be accretive starting from the first year and with an average -- an annual average 2%, 3% EPS accretion on the 4-year plan. \r\nIn addition, we confirm we expect to receive cumulative dividends up to around 90% of our initial investment for the equity within 2023. \r\nFinally, let me highlight that, also for the acquisition of TAG, in setting the price, we consider the minimum threshold for our targeted equity IRR at the level of the low double digit. \r\nLet me now give you some highlights on the expected growth of our nonconsolidated assets. In 2014, the contribution from our associates was EUR 79 million, of which [ph] from our international assets. As you can see from the chart, we expect, by 2018, a net income from associates surging to [indiscernible] EUR 30 million, 65% higher than 2004. This result is fueled primarily by both TAG and TIGF. Keep in mind that we acquired the residual stake of AES Torino as of July 1, 2014, and therefore, reducing the domestic contribution going forward. \r\nMoving to financial discipline. Let me now draw your attention to key themes, balance sheet solidity and financial efficiency. Starting from the soundness of our balance sheet, we expect our full year investment plan to be fully financed by our operating cash flow. This should allow us to maintain a strong balance sheet and support our commitment to protect group's solid credit worthiness. As for return [ph] metrics, we estimate a level of our net debt to asset in line with the current level. Also, if we consider the most severe adjustment carried out by the credit agencies, it remains below 55%. \r\nRegarding cash flow-based metrics, they are in the high end operating guidelines, benefiting also from the soundness, visibility and resilience of our cash flow generation. \r\nBut now let me spend a few words on our strong liquidity profile. The buffer -- our buffer is represented by around EUR 3 billion of undrawn committed credit facilities. Going forward, we reaffirm our commitment to a safe liquidity profile in the medium term to cover debt repayment schedule, to support a convenient approach in the debt capital market and to provide comfortable financial flexibility, while minimizing the cost related to undrawn committed lines. \r\nAs regards maturity and debt breakdown, we stick our goal to maintain the average maturity of our outstanding medium- to long-term debt at around 5 years and to have 2/3 of our debt at fixed rate. The last 2 factors are consistent with the mechanics of our tariff framework and our goal to protect our financial outperformance, align as much as possible debt duration with the regulatory view, frequency as a part on an appropriate asset and liability management approach, and locking today's cost-of-debt conditions in the medium-term, without keeping potential opportunity offered by the credit market. \r\nHaving said that, let me elaborate on the elements that are expected to be the 2 pillars of our equity story going forward, financial outperformance and flexibility. As regard the first, we believe that our refinancing needs in the future could turn into opportunities of further cost savings, thanks to the rollover of around EUR 5 billion of bonds over the plan period, of which EUR 4.5 billion at fixed rate, leveraging on the remarkable fall in interest rates and credit spreads experienced in the last few years, with an average savings well in excess of 200 basis point for the potential new issues versus the expiring ones; and secondly, a proactive and opportunistic attitude in the treasury management optimization and banking lines renegotiations, leveraging on long-lasting relationship with the core banks and favorable market condition. \r\nMoreover, we expect to benefit from a wide portfolio of infrastructures projects potentially eligible for institutional financing, which represent a competitive source of funding versus bank and the capital market in terms of both tenure and cost. \r\nFinally, please also take into account that 2015 will record the full year effect of the optimization measures carried out in the second half of 2014. As a result, based on the current market condition, we expect the cost of our debt for 2015 to average around 2.9%.\r\nNow let's comment about the restoration on our financial flexibilities -- flexibility achieved, thanks to: firstly, the considerable financial expenses reduction, as I said before, then the equity-based acquisition of TAG at year end 2014 with a positive impact both of Snam metrics and its overall credit worthiness; and then -- and thirdly, the consolidation of the Robin Hood tax from 2015 with an estimate positive impact of EUR 90 million in 2015. \r\nFinally, the selected investment in accordance with the evolution of the gas market needs. This financial flexibility is expected to support our equity story, based on an attractive and sustainable return for shareholders, while at the same time, preserving the low-risk profile of the group's financial structure, the capability to capture potential opportunities, and the opportunistic and proactive approach in our future refinancing actions.\r\nNow I hand you over to Carlo for the final remarks.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Carlo Malacarne (Executives)】\nThank you, Antonio. Why is Snam able to provide an attractive and sustainable shareholder return? Because we have reliable results fueled by new potential stream of revenues, a solid balance sheet, and we constantly seek operational and financial efficiency. In this presentation, we have outlined the adaptability of our asset portfolio that the management team and I will exploit with selective and disciplined investment to create value, bringing a steady flow of growth even in a tough environment. Furthermore, the soundness of our balance sheet remains of utmost importance, and the cash flow generated by our operating activity during the plan period is expected to fund our asset growth, thus, providing us the possibility to maintain the leverage within 55%. \r\nSnam value creation is and will be supported by the increasing contribution of nonconsolidated international associates, which are expected to post remarkable growth at the net income contribution in the plan period. \r\nWe are progressing in our path to increase the flexibility of the overall gas system by developing new services for our customers. This will open up a new potential stream of revenues to further support the soundness of our result, without forgetting that we remain committed to exploiting operating and financial efficiency in order to further strengthen our overall performance. \r\nLast but not least, it's worth noting, they restore financial flexibly as a result of our solid cash flow generation and rigorous financial discipline. All these feed our dividend policy aimed at paying a sustainable and attractive dividend. For the fiscal year 2015, we confirm that we intend to distribute EUR 0.25 per share. \r\nWe are entering a year of uncertainty due to the upcoming medium-term regulatory review, therefore, we do not consider it appropriate to set medium-term dividend policy, but is in our ultimate goal to maintain sound return for our shareholder. \r\nWe are ready to answer any questions you may have, please.",
      "transcript_text3": "Okay, we will start from the floor and then we will move to the conference call.\n\n---\n\nThis is Javier Suarez, Mediabanca, three questions. The first one is that, I have noticed that the company has reduced the CapEx versus the previous business plan, and that is particularly on the transmission and storage activities, and I just wondering if you can guide us for the reasoning behind this decrease on the annual CapEx. And also, I have noticed that the company has decreased the guidance for the rapid growth for the next few years. On the previous business plan, it was close to 3%, now it's 1%. Obviously, part of the explanation has to be linked to lower CapEx, but part of the explanation is probably linked to the lower deflator use. Can you kindly guide us through the reasoning behind this lower RAB growth? And the third question that I have is on the financing of all the auctioning process for gas distribution, because my understanding is that the business plan is not considering additional investment for the consolidation process. So the question is, how Italgas intends to participate in this consolidation process, and how this could be financed?\n\n---\n\nThank you. Our business plan consider the -- first of all, the CapEx plan in line, completely in line with the European and Italian energy strategy. There is no intention of Snam to start with the spending of new transmission CapEx plan, without the transmission contract in any way without to be sure the deadline for the new supply of gas in Italy. The 8 bcm we had in the previous CapEx plan. So the approach is not to cancel investment, but is only the intention to delay some spending, maintaining completely our project, align our spending with the new sources, the new supply of gas, which today the deadline is end of 2020, beginning of 2021. This is the reason why it's a shift of investment completely in line with the previous business plan. \r\nFor the storage, the intention is -- first of all, we completed -- we will complete the investment linked to the Decree 130. We have the capability and the possibility of new investments in the storage system. You know, we have the possibility to improve the capacity in the Bordolano field. We have a new field today, which is Alfonsine, with the concession. But it's clear that we are very prudent and the intention is to increase the investment in the storage system, when we are sure that the strategic plan by the government -- the energy plan by the government consider an increase of storage as a strategic aspect for the Italian security of supply. That is the reason why we are trying to explain not only in Italy but at the European level the role of the storage. \r\nBut it's clear that the spending have to be very -- let me say, have to be linked to the real possibility to create value of the investment in the storage. There is no sense to invest for the spending without -- to be coherent with the strategy in the development of this type of investment. \r\nIn my opinion, my feeling is that the role of transmission storage in the LNG in the next 3 or 4 year will change completely. I'll give you an example. \r\nThis year, which is warm winters, we are reaching, by the end of March, 10 bcm of storage and a reduction in the gas import. We have to analyze this type of environment. That means that the storage today will take the place of the take-or-pay contract. That is the reason why in terms of security of supply, but in terms of price competition, will become very important the role of the storage. That is the reason why we are ready to invest, to increase, when we have clear the strategy, the evolution of the storage system.\r\nRegard the gas distribution before and after the RAB.The gas distribution is the reason why we have not considered an evolution in investment, financial investment, because it will be financial investment for the new concession, is only because we have a lot of possibility to increase the share in the market. Our objective will be to increase of around 10% -- 10%, 12% the market share in the distribution. Why 10%, 12%? Because we are sure to be very competitive without increase, with marginal cost, we have the possibility, through the auctions, to reach the 40%, 42% of the market, without risk in increasing the operating cost. But there is other possibility. The evolution in the next 3 or 4 year will be very -- could be change completely the environment; could be some, I don't know, merge acquisition; could be the decision of the municipality to sell the network. That is the reason why we have a business plan inside very clear, where we can maintain the profitability of the company to catch the 10% of the market. But we will decide the best, let me say, approach when we'll be very clear the evolution of that. Today it's not so clear, the evolution. I think that the first auctions will start in the second part of the year, not before, and will be very light, the starting process. So we have time to understand, having inside in our portfolio very clear where we will be competitive. Only to complete the investment for the 10% is roughly around EUR 1 billion. [indiscernible] And EUR 1 billion is the flexibility we have today, the financial flexibility.\n\n---\n\nIn terms of the RAB evolution, in order to permit you to calculate, somewhat which is -- the evolution of RAB you have today in comparison with the last year, you have to take into account some elements. First of all, the inflation rate. Last year, we assumed an average inflation rate for the full year plan of 2%. For this plan, we assume, we took into account 0.6% for 2014, 0.7% for 2015 and then an average of 1% in the last 3 years. Secondly, it is the reduction, clearly, the reduction of investment. Thirdly, you also have to consider that in the evolution of the RAB related to the storage, we have also taken into account the new regulatory framework that provides for the investment included in the RAB only when it enters into operation. So the investment -- the spending in the full year's plan that according to the schedule, we have assumed do not enter into operation are not included in this RAB. The amount of the work in -- the work during construction not entered into operation at the end of 2018 is something more than EUR 200 million -- the work in progress, sorry.\n\n---\n\nCosma Panzacchi, Bernstein. I have 3 questions. The first one is on the European outlook. And in particular, given your speech and given also the discussion on the Juncker plan, it is clear that interconnections and cross-country corridors are increasingly important at this point in time. So I wanted to see what, from your point of view, are the next steps in your combination of international operations with Fluxys, also in terms of timing of this? And if, when you are referring to potential M&A, you are focusing more on an expansion in international business from this point of view? Secondly, on the Italian distribution. I've seen that you are very positive on the effect of the mille [indiscernible]  Decree finally starting the tenders. However, from an historical point of view, this is not the first time that this gets delayed with the promise that it will start. So we also know that there are several discussions at that level against the current framework, so what makes you confident about this time is the good time for a start of this? And finally, again, also on the distribution, in terms of smart meters, this has been a recurring theme, if you want, also from a regulatory point of view. However, historically, it seems to me that Italgas hasn't been particularly, let me say, excited in the past at least by the idea of rolling out smart meters given the original targets of the regulators. So what instead, from your point of view, has changed perhaps from a technological point of view or now from a regulatory point of view that makes the case much more interesting?\n\n---\n\nThe first question, our approach to evolution at European level was and is today very clear, very prudent. Our intention is to enter -- to provide merger acquisition or to enter into strategic alliance only when and where it's very clear the evolution of the gas market in the country, where we have a visibility for the strategy by -- set by the regulator and by the government because the volatility and flexibility of the gas market could be a risk. It's not so today clear that merger acquisition infrastructure will be an advantage anyway. That is the reason why we are focused in the 2 corridor because we see the possibility of value creation in South of France. We see the possibility of monitoring the evolution of the strategy in South of France. The debottleneck of Spain, I think, today is a decision. And there is not the risk of change the evolution in the next 4 or 5 years. That is the reason why we provide the acquisition, and we are working inside the country to increase the value to develop this type of acquisition. For the TAG, when we decided for the TAG acquisition, it's clear that it was different position to be very clear for some analysts or for some rumors is a riskier target in respect of TIGF. We analyze very well the evolution of the country. We have first of all the take or the ship-or-pay contract ended in -- will be ending end of 2022, and in the presentation in 2023, we recover 90% of investment. That is the reason why we evaluated the risk anyway. But I think it's not a risk, it's an opportunity because with the discussion, the geopolitical discussion, target will be very strategic in the connection of Eastern countries and center of Europe. And frankly speaking, I don't think that the solution will be taken in the future of the Russian operator will be to change, let me say, the way of Gaza and to exclude TAG for the existing right-of-way. We have to consider that in TAG, we have the second connection to the MEGAL with the South of Germany, and the connection with the Slovak -- it is the name Slovak -- I mean this is Slovak country. And so anyway in the reverse flow with the existing contract, it's quite difficult that the TAG will be in the future an empty pipe anyway. The second aspect, we are in joint venture with the incumbent in Austria. That is the reason why the discussion with the regulator today is true that the regulator will not take into account the volume risk, but the reason is that we have in place ship-or-pay contract by 2022. It's very -- was very clear the regulator set in the regulation. We have cover for the volume risk by the ship-or-pay contract. When the ship-or-pay contract will expire, I think is quite [indiscernible] that the regulatory review have to take into account the different framework. So only to say that our expansion have -- our process and our strategy in expansion have to take into account the environment evolution, not only, let me say, the return or the dividend by the company. In this respect, in the corridor north-south, the first approach was to sign a strategic alliance to be sure that the investment in North of Europe in this corridor will be done by the operators. And today is a sure. There is official feed [ph], the official decision of investment by Fluxys in line with our investment in Italy by end of 2015 and by end of 2018 of 6 bcm roughly of gas export. It is the reason why it's very close the interest of the 2 companies in investing for the reverse flow capacity. The second step that we are discussing today and we are confident to close the agreement in 2015 is that the condition is clear, but we are confident is to have the possibility to manage directly the commercial contract. That means to enter in the share participation directly in the company in Germany and in Switzerland. It's clear that today, we have the due diligence process. But the intention is, frankly speaking, it's not a financial investment because that will not impact in the economic and financial figures, is having the possibility to manage directly the strategy at European level and to, let me say, to bring inside the institution European commitment regulator in Germany; and in Switzerland, the value-added for a connection with south of Italy and with North Africa. Okay, for distribution, frankly speaking, I'm not so confident that the time there was a lot of -- there has been a strong delay, I'm not so confident. This is the reason I said before there is a problem of financial exposure by the municipality by some small company. That is the reason why could be some delays in the auction, but it's quite difficult to wait 4, 5 years without an evolution of the market. The evolution could be the selling process, joint venture, acquisition. But anyway, today, it's quite difficult to say if the auctions will start in 2017 or '18. I don't think that the distribution market could remain in this condition. That is the reason why we are very clear where we are competitive, but we are monitoring the evolution of the market to exploit the best advantages in this way. For the smart metering, at the beginning, 2 years ago, Italgas, we were warm in speeding the investment because the technology was not so strong to guarantee the cost of -- the operation cost of the new smart metering. The different -- a lot of operators worked a lot to set new technology. And today, I think we are ready to start with the investment. And we will -- let me say, we will proceed with the investment in line with the time set by the regulator in the decree. So there is no intention to increase the investment, but we respect the time because we are quite sure that today, the technology is ready for the investment. The second aspect is that for us, the metering system, the smart metering system is an advantage for all the business, not only for the quality in the distribution business. I said before, I called you about some services having the hourly balancing in Italy means strong advantage in terms of dispatching the gas in Italy and information. That is the reason why we have to consider the positive impact in the transmission business and storage business of the metering system.\n\n---\n\nMonica Girardi, Barclays. I have few questions, if I may. The first one is associated with the comment you made on the focused approach to support the dividend policy. I was wondering if you can -- I know that we are in a particular period of time when you have the ongoing renegotiation of your real pretax return, but maybe you can share with us if you believe that your current dividend policy is sustainable, under which regulatory distressed scenario you don't see it sustainable anymore? And if you can share with us what is your assumption in terms of real pretax return into the business plan? And assuming the authorities not getting the number you want, if you have flexibility into managing your CapEx to protect the return to shareholders? The second question is on the cost of debt. Antonio, you guided for the 2015 cost of debt, but clearly, the major benefits would be accumulated towards the business plan period, so due to refinancing. So I was wondering if you can just give us an idea of what's your best estimate in the longer term in terms of cost of debt? Last one, I promise, on Italgas, if you can just give us an update on the ongoing litigation there?\n\n---\n\nI answer the first question. To be very frank with you, my -- I'm confident, my perception is that as usually, the regulator will take a fair approach in defining the tariff reset to allow the company to sustain the business model and the investment infrastructure, which I remind you are completely in-line with the energy strategy, European and Italian energy strategy. And I don't expect it to completely change. First of all, I think that the intention is to maintain a regulatory asset base on real pretax return based on the Italian government bond. The exogenous parameter, as I mentioned, that could be in the risk-free and inflation. But frankly speaking, I'm confident that the approach will be fair. Secondly, if you consider our -- the Snam cash flow generations, the solid balance sheet and I remind restore of financial flexibility we have today, all these item should provide us with a good room, let me say, to manage the potential impact of the tariff reset. I cannot say today we could be all the surprises, but considering cash flow production, balance sheet and restore flexibility, I think we can face the tariff reset without jeopardize our business model. Italgas, after the debt, I give Antonio.\n\n---\n\nCost of debt -- Monica, you know the rules of our company is to give guidance in relation to the current year, so it is 2.9% for 2015. Let me say when we prepared the presentation, it was clear that the -- also for us that it is clear that the benefit of the current situation will be exploited in the following years, and so we try to give the market, to give the analyst some elements for their math. I would say that, first of all, it is useful to have a look at the refinancing exercise, so the bonds that are going to expire -- are going to terminate within the 4 years' plan, so the EUR 4.5 billion of bonds that according to the market condition of today could give us some advantages in the range of above 200 basis points, so this is very easy for you to calculate the impact. I can add one other element which is the cost of our [indiscernible] requisition, which is the average of the banking facilities, our bonds at floating rates, the cost of the significant part of the European bank funding, which is today at floating rates, as an average, you can assume, something below 50 basis point of spread.\n\n---\n\nAn update of the Italgas, I think it's no appropriate litigation. Without summarize all the process, we informed you in July of the situation. Anyway, it's important to highlight that the court decided to invoke a specific Italian law, which is a preventive measure anyway for Italgas. The duration of this arrangement was a set 6 months with the possibility of extension of a further 6 months and maximum 12 months. The last decision in January was to expand the period, expand these 6 months because it's the time set. The reason is that the administrator appointed have to complete the assessment. There's no completely the assessment. We are today, we are working with the court about this point, and is positive that the court ordered to the administrator to set a technical roundtable with Snam and Italgas to, let me say, to agreeing of the measure we can put in place to resolve the problem. So that means that the intention is to speed deposition. I remind you that it's not a crime investigation. It's only an assessment if the procedures and the measure which Italgas has inside are adequate to, let me say, to stop the possibility of infiltration of crime. That is the reason. I have to say that in the last, starting from the summer, it's clear that we are commission and third-party independent, with a third-party independent adviser, it's in particular, Deloitte, I mean to say. We are committed an assessment to understand if the procedure of the company are adequate for this type of procedure. And the result is Autonomous independent adviser. The result is that the procedure of Italgas currently in place are capable at preventing infiltration or facilitation of organized crime, only to say that we are confident that we can speed with the time set by the court, frankly speaking, but we don't have a reason to identify or to expect some impact in the company. It is the reason why there was no discussion with the consolidation. We check with -- not only with the court, which said we have to consolidate. But frankly speaking, we have to work together to try to resolve in the best way, the problem. The same time, it's clear that we -- it's a decision by the court for the consolidation, the appointed administrator have to follow for the managing of the company, the guideline technical, commercial, the guideline of the control company of Snam. So there is no -- there is, let me say, a formal control that the manager in the company will be in line without the risk of some lack in the managing system.\n\n---\n\nAntonella Bianchessi from Citi. Just 2 very quick questions. The first one if you can give us a little bit of insight on what is the ongoing debate with the regulator? Which are your targets? Which are the most important things that you would like to achieve during this regulatory reset? The second question is on the debt. You mentioned that you have EUR 1 billion of headroom. If you can clarify how this is being calculated and how this can change, expand or reduce depending on the regulatory decision, the regulatory allowed return and also the market condition in general? And the third question is, you said that the ideal duration of your debt would be 5 years, but in reality, the regulator is resetting your cost of debt every 2 years. If this were to remain, why would you take the risk to maintain a longer duration? And what is the regulator thinking about it?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Antonella, after the last November, the last -- the [indiscernible] -- end of the year -- the [indiscernible] of the regulators, today, we are waiting the consultation document. Usually, our approach is not to discuss a figure or element about is to understand the total revenue we can have. That is the reason why only with the consultation document, which we expect the issue of the consultation document by May, roughly. We are ready to start all the discussion for all the figures inside the document not only, let me say, that it's free. Today, we are not, is technical, let me say, discussion, but it's general. There is no, let me say, specific point for the new consultation document. I think the consultation document in terms of the regulator is to align all the businesses, power and gas. So it will be very -- it's very clear that is important consultation document. It's not only for Snam. That is the reason why it's quite difficult today to discuss before the regulator what could be the feeling or the intention of the regulators.\n\n---\n\nFor the second point, the flexibility, the EUR 1 billion flexibility, Antonella, it's just a matter of fact. If you consider at least 2 elements, the first one is the rating metrics is just a matter of numbers. If you apply the credit metrics on our numbers, you can easily understand that the EUR 1 billion is a fact. It is also confirmed by the assessment of one of the 2 rating agencies that follows Snam, which in addition to the rating level also disclosed the so-called standalone rating, which in our case is single A-, which is downgraded by some steps to the current one because of the rating of the Republic, the sovereign rate. So it's just a matter of metrics. If you can -- if you want, we can share with you the calculation. In [indiscernible] of the second question, I mean this is the financial flexibility that we want to maintain, and we can use -- we could use in the future this financial flexibility for helping supporting the equity story, both I would say, first of all, supporting the dividend, supporting the capability of the company to capture all the opportunities we can have. I mean we discussed before about distribution. It is clear that having this flexibility, the financial aspect would be much more sexy for us. And therefore, we can -- at the end, you also have to consider that the metrics calculated does not -- did not consider the cancellation of the Robin Tax. Robin Tax means, in our case, a cash flow, higher cash flow, our net income and cash flow of something what -- something around EUR 90 million per year, which at the end is very, very important. No, the [indiscernible] easy, no, no, -- sorry, it's my bad English for me. The duration is the 10 or average 10 or 5 years. In terms of duration of the fixed rate, the duration of the interest rate, our duration is very, very close to the one of the authority. If you consider we have 2/3 of our debt at fixed rate with a duration of 4 to 5 years, and we have 1/3 of our debt at floating rates. So the aggregate duration is very close to the 1, 2 years that is the duration of -- which is the length of the review of the authority.\n\n---\n\nJosé Ruiz from Macquarie. Three questions, if I may. The first one is, if you could help us to understand a little bit more this EUR 40 million of additional revenues from gas facilitation? More specifically, is that the service that you're going to be providing by 2018? and I understand that this is just a minimum because I understand you will have more reverse flow around the gas corridor. The second one is, if you could update us on the launch of the vehicle, the joint venture with Fluxys, the assets you want to put together? And the third one is, you mentioned storage in -- gas storage increasing to 10 bcms. My question is, is this a signal that the gas that Europe has been sending to Asia and to other -- diverting to other destinations is coming back to Europe?\n\n---\n\nThe EUR 40 million, I think the EUR 40 million is the services revenues capability, is an assumption we have done considering the set of proposal we are discussing with the regulators -- with the regulator during this regulatory period. So it's revenues, part of the revenues are outside the regulatory regime. 20% of the revenue are an update of the regulatory regimes. So considering all the capability to -- the capability of the service proposal roughly, we can estimate an increase of the revenue of EUR 40 million. The environment, the gas evolution and the trend of using more storage than the import, I think, frankly speaking, is my opinion, I'm not a shipper or trading company but is only price -- the problem of price competition is economic problem. That is the reason why, in Italy, we are 90%, 100% because that's part of the industrial sector. The storage are 100% of regulated business, but it's in a way to use as a merchant, the regulated storage. So the possibility to fill the storage during the summer period with low, low tariff, so the tariff is lower than the regulatory framework. That is the reason it's an advantage to cut the logistic cost for the trading company or the shipper. That is the reason why there is interest to fill the storage and to use more storage in the winter period instead the take-or-pay import of gas. But I think it's important because it's an evolution. There is more volatility. This is an evolution of the market condition of gas. So that is the reason that is, and let me say, signal that translation of the take-or-pay in spot quarter [ph]. So in terms of infrastructure, I think it's an evaluation we have to done because we need more flexibility and more interconnection of transmission storage LNG. So we have to combine a network with a strong interconnection, not only for Italy but for at European level. There are lots of questions. For Fluxys, we completed the agreement for the strategic alliance in terms of commitment of investment for Fluxys and for Snam in Italy, and we are working to set the final decision of enter in the share participation of the company, and so share of participation of Fluxys and Snam in the foreign company -- in the asset company.\n\n---\n\nIt's Anna Maria Scaglia from Morgan Stanley. Two questions, if I may. The first one is related to the other revenues line. You booked the [indiscernible] EUR 60 million. I was wondering what's the evolution expected there? And if so, the EUR 40 million we spoke before, if those would be included there, even they're not all regulated revenues? And the second question is still related to dividend and regulation. Provided, of course, the level of disclosure by the regulator is almost 0 at the moment, I was wondering, is there a scenario where with the end of the Robin Hood tax, your payout actually would go down, if, let's say, on my numbers of around 5% allowed to return. So under those scenarios, are you willing to consider, longer term, a minimum dividend plus a payout base policy? Or is this way too early to talk about that?\n\n---\n\nI take on the easy one which is the one related to the other revenues. I remember there was an increase of EUR 20 million, from EUR 40 million to EUR 60 million. The major part of the increase is due to some revenues we had, the nonregulated revenues we had for the storage but is related to subcontracts we have with ENI in relation to the Decree 130. So nothing related to the other new services. So for that item, I think that EUR 40 million remain -- as for the future, the level of EUR 40 million remains significant, reasonable at least level for projecting our net income and does not include anything of the additional revenues we were discussing before.\n\n---\n\nWithin the regulation, I said before that apart from I'm confident that the regulatory update will be fair anyway for our -- to confirm our business model. Our commitment, as I said before, our -- the main commitment we have is to deliver to our shareholder a sustainable and attractive return. So only to say that it's clear that it's serious to maintain the dividend in 2015 waiting evolution, but the main commitment is to deliver strong return to our shareholder. I think we can analyze the possibility to evaluate the 80%, the payout. I think it's early today to set a dividend policy with the payout.\n\n---\n\nI would say the payout has been always for us the reference for understanding which is the sustainability of our dividends. The target, the guidance has been always in terms of the dividend per share. Today, with the new tax rate, we expect that 20% [ph] would mean something around 80%, so sustainable for the future. This is the starting point. We will see the evolution take into account the reset, the review of the tariff starting from 2016. But again, it's not -- our policy was never, was not in the past linked to the payout. It was a pure dividend per share policy.\n\n---\n\nEnrico Bartoli from MainFirst. First of all, 2 general questions. One, you mentioned that the MIDCAT is, let's say, at your level, a decision. So this is going to unlock a lot of import capacity at European level through the Spanish LNG. Do you think that this is going to cannibalize in some way the medium, long-term perspectives of investments in the gas system in Italy? Then a question on gas. This is, we know, a very, very longer process. There was recently some statement by the Algerian authorities saying that they would like to go on with this project. And what is your feeling of the feasibility considering the international situation at the moment? And then, of course, on some figures, if you can give us the RAB at the end of 2014 and what you expect for the end of this year and possibly also the net debt for -- at the end of '15, please?\n\n---\n\nOn MIDCAT, I think it will be an opportunity. It's not a risk for the Italian reverse flow. The first step of the TIGF CapEx plan, 4 years CapEx plan, is the interconnection from the hub of south of France to northeast of France. Northeast of France is the connection with Switzerland and Italy. So in this case, I think, means to put on the market more liquidity of gas.\r\nSo it is an opportunity. There's no -- let me say, the more Spanish gas. There is no -- the possibility to jeopardize the investment or reverse flow. When you speak about reverse flow, we speak about interconnection. So the way of the gas depend of the price competition. It's not a physical decision, but depending on the price competition. Today, with the completely connection, with the European gas exchange -- all European gas exchange, we can buy in France, in Germany or in Spain the gas at a different price. So what is important is that there is a strong interconnection through the country. So there is no problem of stop the investment or reverse flow. For Galsi, frankly speaking, today, in the last month, there have been a lot of rumors of Sonatrach and larger operators to speed Galsi. I think, Galsi in terms of value of investment, in terms of the possibility to bring gas in Europe by Sonatrach, by the Algerian country, I think is an event. Because reaching the North of Italy with the investment of connection from Algeria to Sardinia, I think is an opportunity. The problem is that I don't see today the environment ready to sign a long-term contract. It could be a risk for the producer. The decision could be to enter directly in the market. I said before that without a shipper to enter directly in the market, I don't know, but today I think is -- if the market -- in general, the market is not ready to sign and to define, to take a final investment decision for gas like this has been [ph].\n\n---\n\nRAB, the estimation on the RAB at the end of 2013 from 2014. At the end of 2014, our estimation is EUR 24.7 billion, which implies an inflation of 0.6% for 2014. Starting from this element, assuming an inflation of 0.7% and the investment of EUR 1.3 billion, the RAB at the end of 2015 is estimated in EUR 25 billion. Our debt. As far as our debt is concerned, at the end of 2015, I would say that if we consider the cancellation of the Robin Hood tax that should not be -- should not have any payment -- further payment for this year. So a saving of EUR 90 million. And the cash in, we have already realized for the entrance of category called NKGF [ph]. The guidelines of our net debt at the end of the year is EUR 13.8 billion, EUR 13.9 billion. The difference, in particular, I would underline depends on the -- some item in the working capital, that is associated with the balancing mechanism and is not in our power to manage the result of these working capital, but it depends on the position that the shipper will take at the end of the year. So this is the range that cannot be managed by the company.\n\n---\n\nVery quickly just 2 questions. The first, regarding the RAB of the top at the end of '14. If you can give this number. The second regarding the extra return, the incentives on investments. The regulator introduced an auto-based system on the storage and it is probably doing the same also for electricity transmission. Do you expect that also for gas transport, we can see something similar and what are the risks in this case and also if you have a time frame when this could happen?\n\n---\n\nFrom the RAB of TAG, I would need a few seconds. First of all, for being -- it is clear that TAG operates under a fully regulated tariff regime with a RAB-based mechanism, first of all. But it is somewhat different from the Italian one being in Austria, the regulatory framework based on a fixed book capacity mechanism, which means that there is an exposure to the book capacity. So the quality of the quality, the structure is different. On the RAB, you know that the regulation in Austria recognized the return on equity, which is 9%, something more than 9% and the cost of debt, which is something more than 4%. That applied the first one on the 60% of the asset at reconstruction value. The other one at 40% of the asset at book value. We can give the name of RAB to the sum of the 60% and this 40%. Even if 60% is at the current level and 40% is the book level, this value is more than EUR 1 billion.\n\n---\n\nThe second question. First of all, we have to manage the storage because we don't have the final tariff, which would be -- final tariff in July, so the problem. So we are discussing the problem of work in progress and so on. It's not a final decision. Anyway, if -- to be very clear, if that would be the final decision, the intention is to appeal to the administrative court only because the investment we are doing are linked to the Decree 130. So all the investment inside the 130 are committed -- were committed 2 years ago, first of all, but this is a -- it's not a question. The other -- for the transmission, I think is different situation because the problem of putting operations investment is very strong in the storage because the time of expanding before putting operation for the new field is 4 years, 3 years. For the transmission, we can put in operations step-by-step without this type of risk. There's no real risk in the transmission. The problem is in the storage today because we are running the investment, we started 2 years ago. So we cannot put in operation a field during the investment. It's completely different approach. That is the reason why you have to face this [indiscernible] storage because it's very different -- storage are not investment we can decide step-by-step. When we start with the field, we have to complete the field for putting in operations on a different approach.\n\n---\n\nLet's now move to the conference calls just to see if there are some questions.\n\n---\n\nAlberto Gandolfi, UBS. I have 3, please. First one is that today the 10-year bond in Italy is 1.1%, and I know the inflation used by the regulator is not the RAB deflator, but from the RAB deflator you're talking about here, it would appear that you have like a real rate of like 0.6%, 0.5%. So the question here is twofold. One, haven't you been maybe a little bit optimistic on inflation on RAB and your dividends is going to be contingent to inflation. So how do you think about the relationship between inflation and dividends, please? And secondly, what type of discussions are you having with the regulator to avoid the situation we incurred towards the end of last year when there was a clear mismatch between inflation and bond yields. Bond yield is a clear 12-month rolling average. Inflation, I still don't understand where the regulator gets it from. So how can we make sure that this time around the regulator is very congruent, consistent in establishing bond yields and inflation, so that we don't have a mismatch for a couple of years. Second one is that you talked about your ratio targets net debt divided by RAB. Can I ask you, do you have a maximum level for 2016 as well, sort of an exceptional level, could you breach that if regulator were to prove particularly harsh and could you modulate effective CapEx even further? And the last one is that, on Slide 31 when you talk about the new revenue stream, can you talk about, please, margins you would expect on those and, perhaps, if you can give extra indication on longer-term growth in these revenues because the arrow is manually drawn, but it looks like suggesting an exponential growth.\n\n---\n\nIn relation to the first question, Alberto, the answer is very difficult. I mean, how can we be sure about the possibility of matching or not mismatching and so on. I think that all of the people familiar with the problem know that it will be something of important [indiscernible] we'll be discussing with the regulator sure that the outcome will be such if -- that we'll permit the company to maintain its equity story and to make the investment that the Italian gas market needs. For the second question, I would say that the maximum leverage -- possible answer is that we don't see in all our sensitivities. It is difficult for us to see the risk of touching level that exceed the one -- the metrics of the current ratings. One of the reference is the 60% to the RAB that you know is considered one of the reference and is difficult for us to imagine -- to touch these thresholds in the 4-year span even if some difficulties occurs. For the EUR 40 million, I would say that the guidelines is that we are discussing and we could expect support in terms of additional revenues for this 4-year plan up to EUR 40 million. It is difficult to have guidelines after the horizon of the plan.\n\n---\n\nAlberto, only to do some comment about the first question. If you remember, all -- the regulatory review, there is no review where we discuss with the regulator each figures. Usually, the discussion using the framework of the regulatory decision, and the regulator usually takes into account all the framework. So risk-free inflation, I don't think that the discussion will be to discuss the inflation without the other parameters, to discuss the risk free without inflation. It's not a mathematical, I can say, composition. So I imagine that the discussion and clarification will be considering the possibility to set a return, which give to the companies, in general, because it's not only Snam, there are other companies, the possibility to maintain the business flat.\n\n---\n\nJust 2 questions on my side. First one was on the unit costs that you mentioned, you are saying -- how you expect them to remain flat in real terms. I was just wondering if there wasn't [indiscernible] aggressive because I suspect you could think that as you expand the network, there should be some economies of scale there. So I was wondering why efficiency could actually be improved on that side on a per-unit basis. And then the second question that I had is again coming back to the review. I understand it's difficult to give some details at the moment, but again we will keep that in your point your being solo as it is today and we will have to see if any quantitative easing in Europe [indiscernible] gone any further. Do you have any sense, talking with the regulator that he may be possibly stepping away from the previous attitude of looking at the 12-month historical average as a risk-free rate and maybe take a longer term horizon on this one because we [indiscernible] that you're currently in those bond yields, one might say that it is pushing you to have, I guess, 2-year average maturity as well than on your debt, which may be not very sustainable from a financing perspective.\n\n---\n\nAs far as this question, the guidance that we are giving in terms of operating cost is flat. In real terms, with the current parameter, does not include the possible effect of the optimization of the portfolio in the distribution and the increase of our market share in the distribution. The guidelines is maintaining the current parameter, if I catch your question. So the upside deriving from possible further optimization in our portfolio in the distribution is not included in this guidance. As far as the second question -- I mean, those are the ones that you explained -- you described are some of the large part -- large number of elements, parameters that we will discuss with the regulator in order -- with -- for the review, if not today, the time for discussing this at the -- I mean, we will have the consultation document to be commented and that will be the occasion for us for giving a contributor on the discussion.\n\n---\n\nI've got 3 questions. The first question is on storage. Carlo, I noted, obviously, you've got a lower CapEx in storage for next 4 years and part of that's because of the lack of, I guess, strategy clarity in Italy as well as in Europe. Can you share with us maybe what to look out for? What milestones should we be looking out for? Is there a discussion on the EU level that we should be following and I guess, once we see that, we should expect a higher CapEx in storage. So that's the first question. Second question is back to the international JV that you have with Fluxys. I recognize discussions on future investments aren't finalized. Can we just get a little bit of timelines as to when we should expect that? I assume CapEx, once announced, is over and above the amounts that you've announced today. And lastly, just very shortly on Robin Hood tax. Is there any discussion or appeals by the government on this? If you could just shed some light on that.\n\n---\n\nFrom the first question, my analysis coming from the increasing role of the storage, not only in Italy but at European level, I think that the only possibility to have resources, gas resources to substitute the take-or-pay the import in case of, let me say, lack of import gas, for example, the Russia gas and so on. I think we have enough storage today at European level. We speak about 100 bcm to consider to cover the analysis period during the winter period with the storage system. And it makes sense to pooling part of the storage for the different countries to create a reserve as we have in the oil system. There is a reason why I said today we are ready to increase the investment in storage, but I -- our objective -- our approach is to create value for our investment. To pooling the storage system at European level is a new way to create value in new storage investment. If you need to cover 4, 5 months of Russian gas, in Europe, we need roughly 40, 50 bcm of storage. So it could be, let me say, the possibility to share the existing storage if the storage or major storages remain empty or to build new storage system to guarantee a system with criteria and rules set by a European body to manage the gas exchange in the storage through the TSO, to the operators. So is the possibility to improve the storage investment, let me say, without considering only the country situation, but considering the gas need at European level. There is a reason why I said, there is no strictly connected with our CapEx plan in storage. We are investing to complete the Italian decree to resolve the Italian problem, but it makes sense to consider an evolution in the storage system at European level. With Fluxys, there is not today intention to put capital employed in the joint venture we are doing today. So it's a share of participation without capital employed right now. For the Robin tax, the question is if -- okay, frankly speaking, today the discussion -- the political discussion is to reduce anyway the corporate taxes, not to increase the corporate taxes, to improve the industrial growth. Anyway, some rumors in the last week was replacement, it's only a rumor, frankly speaking. I am not information about this type of discussion or replacement of Robin Hood with the carbon tax. Anyway, only to say that the costs related to the CO2 was non -- negligible, close to 0. So there is no impact for now.\n\n---\n\nI think we have exhausted more or less 2.5 hours. So I think -- thank you, everybody. And anyways, if you have additional questions, please contact the IR Department. And just remember that the press conference will follow shortly on the same location. Thank you. Bye-bye, everybody.",
      "transcript_text4": "【回答: Marco Porro (Executives)】\nOkay, we will start from the floor and then we will move to the conference call.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Javier Suarez Hernandez (Analysts)】\nThis is Javier Suarez, Mediabanca, three questions. The first one is that, I have noticed that the company has reduced the CapEx versus the previous business plan, and that is particularly on the transmission and storage activities, and I just wondering if you can guide us for the reasoning behind this decrease on the annual CapEx. And also, I have noticed that the company has decreased the guidance for the rapid growth for the next few years. On the previous business plan, it was close to 3%, now it's 1%. Obviously, part of the explanation has to be linked to lower CapEx, but part of the explanation is probably linked to the lower deflator use. Can you kindly guide us through the reasoning behind this lower RAB growth? And the third question that I have is on the financing of all the auctioning process for gas distribution, because my understanding is that the business plan is not considering additional investment for the consolidation process. So the question is, how Italgas intends to participate in this consolidation process, and how this could be financed?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Carlo Malacarne (Executives)】\nThank you. Our business plan consider the -- first of all, the CapEx plan in line, completely in line with the European and Italian energy strategy. There is no intention of Snam to start with the spending of new transmission CapEx plan, without the transmission contract in any way without to be sure the deadline for the new supply of gas in Italy. The 8 bcm we had in the previous CapEx plan. So the approach is not to cancel investment, but is only the intention to delay some spending, maintaining completely our project, align our spending with the new sources, the new supply of gas, which today the deadline is end of 2020, beginning of 2021. This is the reason why it's a shift of investment completely in line with the previous business plan. \r\nFor the storage, the intention is -- first of all, we completed -- we will complete the investment linked to the Decree 130. We have the capability and the possibility of new investments in the storage system. You know, we have the possibility to improve the capacity in the Bordolano field. We have a new field today, which is Alfonsine, with the concession. But it's clear that we are very prudent and the intention is to increase the investment in the storage system, when we are sure that the strategic plan by the government -- the energy plan by the government consider an increase of storage as a strategic aspect for the Italian security of supply. That is the reason why we are trying to explain not only in Italy but at the European level the role of the storage. \r\nBut it's clear that the spending have to be very -- let me say, have to be linked to the real possibility to create value of the investment in the storage. There is no sense to invest for the spending without -- to be coherent with the strategy in the development of this type of investment. \r\nIn my opinion, my feeling is that the role of transmission storage in the LNG in the next 3 or 4 year will change completely. I'll give you an example. \r\nThis year, which is warm winters, we are reaching, by the end of March, 10 bcm of storage and a reduction in the gas import. We have to analyze this type of environment. That means that the storage today will take the place of the take-or-pay contract. That is the reason why in terms of security of supply, but in terms of price competition, will become very important the role of the storage. That is the reason why we are ready to invest, to increase, when we have clear the strategy, the evolution of the storage system.\r\nRegard the gas distribution before and after the RAB.The gas distribution is the reason why we have not considered an evolution in investment, financial investment, because it will be financial investment for the new concession, is only because we have a lot of possibility to increase the share in the market. Our objective will be to increase of around 10% -- 10%, 12% the market share in the distribution. Why 10%, 12%? Because we are sure to be very competitive without increase, with marginal cost, we have the possibility, through the auctions, to reach the 40%, 42% of the market, without risk in increasing the operating cost. But there is other possibility. The evolution in the next 3 or 4 year will be very -- could be change completely the environment; could be some, I don't know, merge acquisition; could be the decision of the municipality to sell the network. That is the reason why we have a business plan inside very clear, where we can maintain the profitability of the company to catch the 10% of the market. But we will decide the best, let me say, approach when we'll be very clear the evolution of that. Today it's not so clear, the evolution. I think that the first auctions will start in the second part of the year, not before, and will be very light, the starting process. So we have time to understand, having inside in our portfolio very clear where we will be competitive. Only to complete the investment for the 10% is roughly around EUR 1 billion. [indiscernible] And EUR 1 billion is the flexibility we have today, the financial flexibility.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Antonio Paccioretti (Executives)】\nIn terms of the RAB evolution, in order to permit you to calculate, somewhat which is -- the evolution of RAB you have today in comparison with the last year, you have to take into account some elements. First of all, the inflation rate. Last year, we assumed an average inflation rate for the full year plan of 2%. For this plan, we assume, we took into account 0.6% for 2014, 0.7% for 2015 and then an average of 1% in the last 3 years. Secondly, it is the reduction, clearly, the reduction of investment. Thirdly, you also have to consider that in the evolution of the RAB related to the storage, we have also taken into account the new regulatory framework that provides for the investment included in the RAB only when it enters into operation. So the investment -- the spending in the full year's plan that according to the schedule, we have assumed do not enter into operation are not included in this RAB. The amount of the work in -- the work during construction not entered into operation at the end of 2018 is something more than EUR 200 million -- the work in progress, sorry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Cosma Panzacchi (Analysts)】\nCosma Panzacchi, Bernstein. I have 3 questions. The first one is on the European outlook. And in particular, given your speech and given also the discussion on the Juncker plan, it is clear that interconnections and cross-country corridors are increasingly important at this point in time. So I wanted to see what, from your point of view, are the next steps in your combination of international operations with Fluxys, also in terms of timing of this? And if, when you are referring to potential M&A, you are focusing more on an expansion in international business from this point of view? Secondly, on the Italian distribution. I've seen that you are very positive on the effect of the mille [indiscernible]  Decree finally starting the tenders. However, from an historical point of view, this is not the first time that this gets delayed with the promise that it will start. So we also know that there are several discussions at that level against the current framework, so what makes you confident about this time is the good time for a start of this? And finally, again, also on the distribution, in terms of smart meters, this has been a recurring theme, if you want, also from a regulatory point of view. However, historically, it seems to me that Italgas hasn't been particularly, let me say, excited in the past at least by the idea of rolling out smart meters given the original targets of the regulators. So what instead, from your point of view, has changed perhaps from a technological point of view or now from a regulatory point of view that makes the case much more interesting?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Carlo Malacarne (Executives)】\nThe first question, our approach to evolution at European level was and is today very clear, very prudent. Our intention is to enter -- to provide merger acquisition or to enter into strategic alliance only when and where it's very clear the evolution of the gas market in the country, where we have a visibility for the strategy by -- set by the regulator and by the government because the volatility and flexibility of the gas market could be a risk. It's not so today clear that merger acquisition infrastructure will be an advantage anyway. That is the reason why we are focused in the 2 corridor because we see the possibility of value creation in South of France. We see the possibility of monitoring the evolution of the strategy in South of France. The debottleneck of Spain, I think, today is a decision. And there is not the risk of change the evolution in the next 4 or 5 years. That is the reason why we provide the acquisition, and we are working inside the country to increase the value to develop this type of acquisition. For the TAG, when we decided for the TAG acquisition, it's clear that it was different position to be very clear for some analysts or for some rumors is a riskier target in respect of TIGF. We analyze very well the evolution of the country. We have first of all the take or the ship-or-pay contract ended in -- will be ending end of 2022, and in the presentation in 2023, we recover 90% of investment. That is the reason why we evaluated the risk anyway. But I think it's not a risk, it's an opportunity because with the discussion, the geopolitical discussion, target will be very strategic in the connection of Eastern countries and center of Europe. And frankly speaking, I don't think that the solution will be taken in the future of the Russian operator will be to change, let me say, the way of Gaza and to exclude TAG for the existing right-of-way. We have to consider that in TAG, we have the second connection to the MEGAL with the South of Germany, and the connection with the Slovak -- it is the name Slovak -- I mean this is Slovak country. And so anyway in the reverse flow with the existing contract, it's quite difficult that the TAG will be in the future an empty pipe anyway. The second aspect, we are in joint venture with the incumbent in Austria. That is the reason why the discussion with the regulator today is true that the regulator will not take into account the volume risk, but the reason is that we have in place ship-or-pay contract by 2022. It's very -- was very clear the regulator set in the regulation. We have cover for the volume risk by the ship-or-pay contract. When the ship-or-pay contract will expire, I think is quite [indiscernible] that the regulatory review have to take into account the different framework. So only to say that our expansion have -- our process and our strategy in expansion have to take into account the environment evolution, not only, let me say, the return or the dividend by the company. In this respect, in the corridor north-south, the first approach was to sign a strategic alliance to be sure that the investment in North of Europe in this corridor will be done by the operators. And today is a sure. There is official feed [ph], the official decision of investment by Fluxys in line with our investment in Italy by end of 2015 and by end of 2018 of 6 bcm roughly of gas export. It is the reason why it's very close the interest of the 2 companies in investing for the reverse flow capacity. The second step that we are discussing today and we are confident to close the agreement in 2015 is that the condition is clear, but we are confident is to have the possibility to manage directly the commercial contract. That means to enter in the share participation directly in the company in Germany and in Switzerland. It's clear that today, we have the due diligence process. But the intention is, frankly speaking, it's not a financial investment because that will not impact in the economic and financial figures, is having the possibility to manage directly the strategy at European level and to, let me say, to bring inside the institution European commitment regulator in Germany; and in Switzerland, the value-added for a connection with south of Italy and with North Africa. Okay, for distribution, frankly speaking, I'm not so confident that the time there was a lot of -- there has been a strong delay, I'm not so confident. This is the reason I said before there is a problem of financial exposure by the municipality by some small company. That is the reason why could be some delays in the auction, but it's quite difficult to wait 4, 5 years without an evolution of the market. The evolution could be the selling process, joint venture, acquisition. But anyway, today, it's quite difficult to say if the auctions will start in 2017 or '18. I don't think that the distribution market could remain in this condition. That is the reason why we are very clear where we are competitive, but we are monitoring the evolution of the market to exploit the best advantages in this way. For the smart metering, at the beginning, 2 years ago, Italgas, we were warm in speeding the investment because the technology was not so strong to guarantee the cost of -- the operation cost of the new smart metering. The different -- a lot of operators worked a lot to set new technology. And today, I think we are ready to start with the investment. And we will -- let me say, we will proceed with the investment in line with the time set by the regulator in the decree. So there is no intention to increase the investment, but we respect the time because we are quite sure that today, the technology is ready for the investment. The second aspect is that for us, the metering system, the smart metering system is an advantage for all the business, not only for the quality in the distribution business. I said before, I called you about some services having the hourly balancing in Italy means strong advantage in terms of dispatching the gas in Italy and information. That is the reason why we have to consider the positive impact in the transmission business and storage business of the metering system.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Monica Girardi (Analysts)】\nMonica Girardi, Barclays. I have few questions, if I may. The first one is associated with the comment you made on the focused approach to support the dividend policy. I was wondering if you can -- I know that we are in a particular period of time when you have the ongoing renegotiation of your real pretax return, but maybe you can share with us if you believe that your current dividend policy is sustainable, under which regulatory distressed scenario you don't see it sustainable anymore? And if you can share with us what is your assumption in terms of real pretax return into the business plan? And assuming the authorities not getting the number you want, if you have flexibility into managing your CapEx to protect the return to shareholders? The second question is on the cost of debt. Antonio, you guided for the 2015 cost of debt, but clearly, the major benefits would be accumulated towards the business plan period, so due to refinancing. So I was wondering if you can just give us an idea of what's your best estimate in the longer term in terms of cost of debt? Last one, I promise, on Italgas, if you can just give us an update on the ongoing litigation there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Carlo Malacarne (Executives)】\nI answer the first question. To be very frank with you, my -- I'm confident, my perception is that as usually, the regulator will take a fair approach in defining the tariff reset to allow the company to sustain the business model and the investment infrastructure, which I remind you are completely in-line with the energy strategy, European and Italian energy strategy. And I don't expect it to completely change. First of all, I think that the intention is to maintain a regulatory asset base on real pretax return based on the Italian government bond. The exogenous parameter, as I mentioned, that could be in the risk-free and inflation. But frankly speaking, I'm confident that the approach will be fair. Secondly, if you consider our -- the Snam cash flow generations, the solid balance sheet and I remind restore of financial flexibility we have today, all these item should provide us with a good room, let me say, to manage the potential impact of the tariff reset. I cannot say today we could be all the surprises, but considering cash flow production, balance sheet and restore flexibility, I think we can face the tariff reset without jeopardize our business model. Italgas, after the debt, I give Antonio.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Antonio Paccioretti (Executives)】\nCost of debt -- Monica, you know the rules of our company is to give guidance in relation to the current year, so it is 2.9% for 2015. Let me say when we prepared the presentation, it was clear that the -- also for us that it is clear that the benefit of the current situation will be exploited in the following years, and so we try to give the market, to give the analyst some elements for their math. I would say that, first of all, it is useful to have a look at the refinancing exercise, so the bonds that are going to expire -- are going to terminate within the 4 years' plan, so the EUR 4.5 billion of bonds that according to the market condition of today could give us some advantages in the range of above 200 basis points, so this is very easy for you to calculate the impact. I can add one other element which is the cost of our [indiscernible] requisition, which is the average of the banking facilities, our bonds at floating rates, the cost of the significant part of the European bank funding, which is today at floating rates, as an average, you can assume, something below 50 basis point of spread.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Carlo Malacarne (Executives)】\nAn update of the Italgas, I think it's no appropriate litigation. Without summarize all the process, we informed you in July of the situation. Anyway, it's important to highlight that the court decided to invoke a specific Italian law, which is a preventive measure anyway for Italgas. The duration of this arrangement was a set 6 months with the possibility of extension of a further 6 months and maximum 12 months. The last decision in January was to expand the period, expand these 6 months because it's the time set. The reason is that the administrator appointed have to complete the assessment. There's no completely the assessment. We are today, we are working with the court about this point, and is positive that the court ordered to the administrator to set a technical roundtable with Snam and Italgas to, let me say, to agreeing of the measure we can put in place to resolve the problem. So that means that the intention is to speed deposition. I remind you that it's not a crime investigation. It's only an assessment if the procedures and the measure which Italgas has inside are adequate to, let me say, to stop the possibility of infiltration of crime. That is the reason. I have to say that in the last, starting from the summer, it's clear that we are commission and third-party independent, with a third-party independent adviser, it's in particular, Deloitte, I mean to say. We are committed an assessment to understand if the procedure of the company are adequate for this type of procedure. And the result is Autonomous independent adviser. The result is that the procedure of Italgas currently in place are capable at preventing infiltration or facilitation of organized crime, only to say that we are confident that we can speed with the time set by the court, frankly speaking, but we don't have a reason to identify or to expect some impact in the company. It is the reason why there was no discussion with the consolidation. We check with -- not only with the court, which said we have to consolidate. But frankly speaking, we have to work together to try to resolve in the best way, the problem. The same time, it's clear that we -- it's a decision by the court for the consolidation, the appointed administrator have to follow for the managing of the company, the guideline technical, commercial, the guideline of the control company of Snam. So there is no -- there is, let me say, a formal control that the manager in the company will be in line without the risk of some lack in the managing system.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Antonella Bianchessi (Analysts)】\nAntonella Bianchessi from Citi. Just 2 very quick questions. The first one if you can give us a little bit of insight on what is the ongoing debate with the regulator? Which are your targets? Which are the most important things that you would like to achieve during this regulatory reset? The second question is on the debt. You mentioned that you have EUR 1 billion of headroom. If you can clarify how this is being calculated and how this can change, expand or reduce depending on the regulatory decision, the regulatory allowed return and also the market condition in general? And the third question is, you said that the ideal duration of your debt would be 5 years, but in reality, the regulator is resetting your cost of debt every 2 years. If this were to remain, why would you take the risk to maintain a longer duration? And what is the regulator thinking about it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Carlo Malacarne (Executives)】\nThank you, Antonella, after the last November, the last -- the [indiscernible] -- end of the year -- the [indiscernible] of the regulators, today, we are waiting the consultation document. Usually, our approach is not to discuss a figure or element about is to understand the total revenue we can have. That is the reason why only with the consultation document, which we expect the issue of the consultation document by May, roughly. We are ready to start all the discussion for all the figures inside the document not only, let me say, that it's free. Today, we are not, is technical, let me say, discussion, but it's general. There is no, let me say, specific point for the new consultation document. I think the consultation document in terms of the regulator is to align all the businesses, power and gas. So it will be very -- it's very clear that is important consultation document. It's not only for Snam. That is the reason why it's quite difficult today to discuss before the regulator what could be the feeling or the intention of the regulators.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Antonio Paccioretti (Executives)】\nFor the second point, the flexibility, the EUR 1 billion flexibility, Antonella, it's just a matter of fact. If you consider at least 2 elements, the first one is the rating metrics is just a matter of numbers. If you apply the credit metrics on our numbers, you can easily understand that the EUR 1 billion is a fact. It is also confirmed by the assessment of one of the 2 rating agencies that follows Snam, which in addition to the rating level also disclosed the so-called standalone rating, which in our case is single A-, which is downgraded by some steps to the current one because of the rating of the Republic, the sovereign rate. So it's just a matter of metrics. If you can -- if you want, we can share with you the calculation. In [indiscernible] of the second question, I mean this is the financial flexibility that we want to maintain, and we can use -- we could use in the future this financial flexibility for helping supporting the equity story, both I would say, first of all, supporting the dividend, supporting the capability of the company to capture all the opportunities we can have. I mean we discussed before about distribution. It is clear that having this flexibility, the financial aspect would be much more sexy for us. And therefore, we can -- at the end, you also have to consider that the metrics calculated does not -- did not consider the cancellation of the Robin Tax. Robin Tax means, in our case, a cash flow, higher cash flow, our net income and cash flow of something what -- something around EUR 90 million per year, which at the end is very, very important. No, the [indiscernible] easy, no, no, -- sorry, it's my bad English for me. The duration is the 10 or average 10 or 5 years. In terms of duration of the fixed rate, the duration of the interest rate, our duration is very, very close to the one of the authority. If you consider we have 2/3 of our debt at fixed rate with a duration of 4 to 5 years, and we have 1/3 of our debt at floating rates. So the aggregate duration is very close to the 1, 2 years that is the duration of -- which is the length of the review of the authority.\n\n---\n\n【質問: José Ruiz (Analysts)】\nJosé Ruiz from Macquarie. Three questions, if I may. The first one is, if you could help us to understand a little bit more this EUR 40 million of additional revenues from gas facilitation? More specifically, is that the service that you're going to be providing by 2018? and I understand that this is just a minimum because I understand you will have more reverse flow around the gas corridor. The second one is, if you could update us on the launch of the vehicle, the joint venture with Fluxys, the assets you want to put together? And the third one is, you mentioned storage in -- gas storage increasing to 10 bcms. My question is, is this a signal that the gas that Europe has been sending to Asia and to other -- diverting to other destinations is coming back to Europe?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Carlo Malacarne (Executives)】\nThe EUR 40 million, I think the EUR 40 million is the services revenues capability, is an assumption we have done considering the set of proposal we are discussing with the regulators -- with the regulator during this regulatory period. So it's revenues, part of the revenues are outside the regulatory regime. 20% of the revenue are an update of the regulatory regimes. So considering all the capability to -- the capability of the service proposal roughly, we can estimate an increase of the revenue of EUR 40 million. The environment, the gas evolution and the trend of using more storage than the import, I think, frankly speaking, is my opinion, I'm not a shipper or trading company but is only price -- the problem of price competition is economic problem. That is the reason why, in Italy, we are 90%, 100% because that's part of the industrial sector. The storage are 100% of regulated business, but it's in a way to use as a merchant, the regulated storage. So the possibility to fill the storage during the summer period with low, low tariff, so the tariff is lower than the regulatory framework. That is the reason it's an advantage to cut the logistic cost for the trading company or the shipper. That is the reason why there is interest to fill the storage and to use more storage in the winter period instead the take-or-pay import of gas. But I think it's important because it's an evolution. There is more volatility. This is an evolution of the market condition of gas. So that is the reason that is, and let me say, signal that translation of the take-or-pay in spot quarter [ph]. So in terms of infrastructure, I think it's an evaluation we have to done because we need more flexibility and more interconnection of transmission storage LNG. So we have to combine a network with a strong interconnection, not only for Italy but for at European level. There are lots of questions. For Fluxys, we completed the agreement for the strategic alliance in terms of commitment of investment for Fluxys and for Snam in Italy, and we are working to set the final decision of enter in the share participation of the company, and so share of participation of Fluxys and Snam in the foreign company -- in the asset company.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anna Maria Scaglia (Analysts)】\nIt's Anna Maria Scaglia from Morgan Stanley. Two questions, if I may. The first one is related to the other revenues line. You booked the [indiscernible] EUR 60 million. I was wondering what's the evolution expected there? And if so, the EUR 40 million we spoke before, if those would be included there, even they're not all regulated revenues? And the second question is still related to dividend and regulation. Provided, of course, the level of disclosure by the regulator is almost 0 at the moment, I was wondering, is there a scenario where with the end of the Robin Hood tax, your payout actually would go down, if, let's say, on my numbers of around 5% allowed to return. So under those scenarios, are you willing to consider, longer term, a minimum dividend plus a payout base policy? Or is this way too early to talk about that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Antonio Paccioretti (Executives)】\nI take on the easy one which is the one related to the other revenues. I remember there was an increase of EUR 20 million, from EUR 40 million to EUR 60 million. The major part of the increase is due to some revenues we had, the nonregulated revenues we had for the storage but is related to subcontracts we have with ENI in relation to the Decree 130. So nothing related to the other new services. So for that item, I think that EUR 40 million remain -- as for the future, the level of EUR 40 million remains significant, reasonable at least level for projecting our net income and does not include anything of the additional revenues we were discussing before.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Carlo Malacarne (Executives)】\nWithin the regulation, I said before that apart from I'm confident that the regulatory update will be fair anyway for our -- to confirm our business model. Our commitment, as I said before, our -- the main commitment we have is to deliver to our shareholder a sustainable and attractive return. So only to say that it's clear that it's serious to maintain the dividend in 2015 waiting evolution, but the main commitment is to deliver strong return to our shareholder. I think we can analyze the possibility to evaluate the 80%, the payout. I think it's early today to set a dividend policy with the payout.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Antonio Paccioretti (Executives)】\nI would say the payout has been always for us the reference for understanding which is the sustainability of our dividends. The target, the guidance has been always in terms of the dividend per share. Today, with the new tax rate, we expect that 20% [ph] would mean something around 80%, so sustainable for the future. This is the starting point. We will see the evolution take into account the reset, the review of the tariff starting from 2016. But again, it's not -- our policy was never, was not in the past linked to the payout. It was a pure dividend per share policy.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Enrico Bartoli (Analysts)】\nEnrico Bartoli from MainFirst. First of all, 2 general questions. One, you mentioned that the MIDCAT is, let's say, at your level, a decision. So this is going to unlock a lot of import capacity at European level through the Spanish LNG. Do you think that this is going to cannibalize in some way the medium, long-term perspectives of investments in the gas system in Italy? Then a question on gas. This is, we know, a very, very longer process. There was recently some statement by the Algerian authorities saying that they would like to go on with this project. And what is your feeling of the feasibility considering the international situation at the moment? And then, of course, on some figures, if you can give us the RAB at the end of 2014 and what you expect for the end of this year and possibly also the net debt for -- at the end of '15, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Carlo Malacarne (Executives)】\nOn MIDCAT, I think it will be an opportunity. It's not a risk for the Italian reverse flow. The first step of the TIGF CapEx plan, 4 years CapEx plan, is the interconnection from the hub of south of France to northeast of France. Northeast of France is the connection with Switzerland and Italy. So in this case, I think, means to put on the market more liquidity of gas.\r\nSo it is an opportunity. There's no -- let me say, the more Spanish gas. There is no -- the possibility to jeopardize the investment or reverse flow. When you speak about reverse flow, we speak about interconnection. So the way of the gas depend of the price competition. It's not a physical decision, but depending on the price competition. Today, with the completely connection, with the European gas exchange -- all European gas exchange, we can buy in France, in Germany or in Spain the gas at a different price. So what is important is that there is a strong interconnection through the country. So there is no problem of stop the investment or reverse flow. For Galsi, frankly speaking, today, in the last month, there have been a lot of rumors of Sonatrach and larger operators to speed Galsi. I think, Galsi in terms of value of investment, in terms of the possibility to bring gas in Europe by Sonatrach, by the Algerian country, I think is an event. Because reaching the North of Italy with the investment of connection from Algeria to Sardinia, I think is an opportunity. The problem is that I don't see today the environment ready to sign a long-term contract. It could be a risk for the producer. The decision could be to enter directly in the market. I said before that without a shipper to enter directly in the market, I don't know, but today I think is -- if the market -- in general, the market is not ready to sign and to define, to take a final investment decision for gas like this has been [ph].\n\n---\n\n【回答: Antonio Paccioretti (Executives)】\nRAB, the estimation on the RAB at the end of 2013 from 2014. At the end of 2014, our estimation is EUR 24.7 billion, which implies an inflation of 0.6% for 2014. Starting from this element, assuming an inflation of 0.7% and the investment of EUR 1.3 billion, the RAB at the end of 2015 is estimated in EUR 25 billion. Our debt. As far as our debt is concerned, at the end of 2015, I would say that if we consider the cancellation of the Robin Hood tax that should not be -- should not have any payment -- further payment for this year. So a saving of EUR 90 million. And the cash in, we have already realized for the entrance of category called NKGF [ph]. The guidelines of our net debt at the end of the year is EUR 13.8 billion, EUR 13.9 billion. The difference, in particular, I would underline depends on the -- some item in the working capital, that is associated with the balancing mechanism and is not in our power to manage the result of these working capital, but it depends on the position that the shipper will take at the end of the year. So this is the range that cannot be managed by the company.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nVery quickly just 2 questions. The first, regarding the RAB of the top at the end of '14. If you can give this number. The second regarding the extra return, the incentives on investments. The regulator introduced an auto-based system on the storage and it is probably doing the same also for electricity transmission. Do you expect that also for gas transport, we can see something similar and what are the risks in this case and also if you have a time frame when this could happen?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Antonio Paccioretti (Executives)】\nFrom the RAB of TAG, I would need a few seconds. First of all, for being -- it is clear that TAG operates under a fully regulated tariff regime with a RAB-based mechanism, first of all. But it is somewhat different from the Italian one being in Austria, the regulatory framework based on a fixed book capacity mechanism, which means that there is an exposure to the book capacity. So the quality of the quality, the structure is different. On the RAB, you know that the regulation in Austria recognized the return on equity, which is 9%, something more than 9% and the cost of debt, which is something more than 4%. That applied the first one on the 60% of the asset at reconstruction value. The other one at 40% of the asset at book value. We can give the name of RAB to the sum of the 60% and this 40%. Even if 60% is at the current level and 40% is the book level, this value is more than EUR 1 billion.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Carlo Malacarne (Executives)】\nThe second question. First of all, we have to manage the storage because we don't have the final tariff, which would be -- final tariff in July, so the problem. So we are discussing the problem of work in progress and so on. It's not a final decision. Anyway, if -- to be very clear, if that would be the final decision, the intention is to appeal to the administrative court only because the investment we are doing are linked to the Decree 130. So all the investment inside the 130 are committed -- were committed 2 years ago, first of all, but this is a -- it's not a question. The other -- for the transmission, I think is different situation because the problem of putting operations investment is very strong in the storage because the time of expanding before putting operation for the new field is 4 years, 3 years. For the transmission, we can put in operations step-by-step without this type of risk. There's no real risk in the transmission. The problem is in the storage today because we are running the investment, we started 2 years ago. So we cannot put in operation a field during the investment. It's completely different approach. That is the reason why you have to face this [indiscernible] storage because it's very different -- storage are not investment we can decide step-by-step. When we start with the field, we have to complete the field for putting in operations on a different approach.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nLet's now move to the conference calls just to see if there are some questions.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Alberto Gandolfi (Analysts)】\nAlberto Gandolfi, UBS. I have 3, please. First one is that today the 10-year bond in Italy is 1.1%, and I know the inflation used by the regulator is not the RAB deflator, but from the RAB deflator you're talking about here, it would appear that you have like a real rate of like 0.6%, 0.5%. So the question here is twofold. One, haven't you been maybe a little bit optimistic on inflation on RAB and your dividends is going to be contingent to inflation. So how do you think about the relationship between inflation and dividends, please? And secondly, what type of discussions are you having with the regulator to avoid the situation we incurred towards the end of last year when there was a clear mismatch between inflation and bond yields. Bond yield is a clear 12-month rolling average. Inflation, I still don't understand where the regulator gets it from. So how can we make sure that this time around the regulator is very congruent, consistent in establishing bond yields and inflation, so that we don't have a mismatch for a couple of years. Second one is that you talked about your ratio targets net debt divided by RAB. Can I ask you, do you have a maximum level for 2016 as well, sort of an exceptional level, could you breach that if regulator were to prove particularly harsh and could you modulate effective CapEx even further? And the last one is that, on Slide 31 when you talk about the new revenue stream, can you talk about, please, margins you would expect on those and, perhaps, if you can give extra indication on longer-term growth in these revenues because the arrow is manually drawn, but it looks like suggesting an exponential growth.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Antonio Paccioretti (Executives)】\nIn relation to the first question, Alberto, the answer is very difficult. I mean, how can we be sure about the possibility of matching or not mismatching and so on. I think that all of the people familiar with the problem know that it will be something of important [indiscernible] we'll be discussing with the regulator sure that the outcome will be such if -- that we'll permit the company to maintain its equity story and to make the investment that the Italian gas market needs. For the second question, I would say that the maximum leverage -- possible answer is that we don't see in all our sensitivities. It is difficult for us to see the risk of touching level that exceed the one -- the metrics of the current ratings. One of the reference is the 60% to the RAB that you know is considered one of the reference and is difficult for us to imagine -- to touch these thresholds in the 4-year span even if some difficulties occurs. For the EUR 40 million, I would say that the guidelines is that we are discussing and we could expect support in terms of additional revenues for this 4-year plan up to EUR 40 million. It is difficult to have guidelines after the horizon of the plan.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Carlo Malacarne (Executives)】\nAlberto, only to do some comment about the first question. If you remember, all -- the regulatory review, there is no review where we discuss with the regulator each figures. Usually, the discussion using the framework of the regulatory decision, and the regulator usually takes into account all the framework. So risk-free inflation, I don't think that the discussion will be to discuss the inflation without the other parameters, to discuss the risk free without inflation. It's not a mathematical, I can say, composition. So I imagine that the discussion and clarification will be considering the possibility to set a return, which give to the companies, in general, because it's not only Snam, there are other companies, the possibility to maintain the business flat.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Olivier Van Doosselaere (Analysts)】\nJust 2 questions on my side. First one was on the unit costs that you mentioned, you are saying -- how you expect them to remain flat in real terms. I was just wondering if there wasn't [indiscernible] aggressive because I suspect you could think that as you expand the network, there should be some economies of scale there. So I was wondering why efficiency could actually be improved on that side on a per-unit basis. And then the second question that I had is again coming back to the review. I understand it's difficult to give some details at the moment, but again we will keep that in your point your being solo as it is today and we will have to see if any quantitative easing in Europe [indiscernible] gone any further. Do you have any sense, talking with the regulator that he may be possibly stepping away from the previous attitude of looking at the 12-month historical average as a risk-free rate and maybe take a longer term horizon on this one because we [indiscernible] that you're currently in those bond yields, one might say that it is pushing you to have, I guess, 2-year average maturity as well than on your debt, which may be not very sustainable from a financing perspective.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nAs far as this question, the guidance that we are giving in terms of operating cost is flat. In real terms, with the current parameter, does not include the possible effect of the optimization of the portfolio in the distribution and the increase of our market share in the distribution. The guidelines is maintaining the current parameter, if I catch your question. So the upside deriving from possible further optimization in our portfolio in the distribution is not included in this guidance. As far as the second question -- I mean, those are the ones that you explained -- you described are some of the large part -- large number of elements, parameters that we will discuss with the regulator in order -- with -- for the review, if not today, the time for discussing this at the -- I mean, we will have the consultation document to be commented and that will be the occasion for us for giving a contributor on the discussion.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Maurice Choy (Analysts)】\nI've got 3 questions. The first question is on storage. Carlo, I noted, obviously, you've got a lower CapEx in storage for next 4 years and part of that's because of the lack of, I guess, strategy clarity in Italy as well as in Europe. Can you share with us maybe what to look out for? What milestones should we be looking out for? Is there a discussion on the EU level that we should be following and I guess, once we see that, we should expect a higher CapEx in storage. So that's the first question. Second question is back to the international JV that you have with Fluxys. I recognize discussions on future investments aren't finalized. Can we just get a little bit of timelines as to when we should expect that? I assume CapEx, once announced, is over and above the amounts that you've announced today. And lastly, just very shortly on Robin Hood tax. Is there any discussion or appeals by the government on this? If you could just shed some light on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Carlo Malacarne (Executives)】\nFrom the first question, my analysis coming from the increasing role of the storage, not only in Italy but at European level, I think that the only possibility to have resources, gas resources to substitute the take-or-pay the import in case of, let me say, lack of import gas, for example, the Russia gas and so on. I think we have enough storage today at European level. We speak about 100 bcm to consider to cover the analysis period during the winter period with the storage system. And it makes sense to pooling part of the storage for the different countries to create a reserve as we have in the oil system. There is a reason why I said today we are ready to increase the investment in storage, but I -- our objective -- our approach is to create value for our investment. To pooling the storage system at European level is a new way to create value in new storage investment. If you need to cover 4, 5 months of Russian gas, in Europe, we need roughly 40, 50 bcm of storage. So it could be, let me say, the possibility to share the existing storage if the storage or major storages remain empty or to build new storage system to guarantee a system with criteria and rules set by a European body to manage the gas exchange in the storage through the TSO, to the operators. So is the possibility to improve the storage investment, let me say, without considering only the country situation, but considering the gas need at European level. There is a reason why I said, there is no strictly connected with our CapEx plan in storage. We are investing to complete the Italian decree to resolve the Italian problem, but it makes sense to consider an evolution in the storage system at European level. With Fluxys, there is not today intention to put capital employed in the joint venture we are doing today. So it's a share of participation without capital employed right now. For the Robin tax, the question is if -- okay, frankly speaking, today the discussion -- the political discussion is to reduce anyway the corporate taxes, not to increase the corporate taxes, to improve the industrial growth. Anyway, some rumors in the last week was replacement, it's only a rumor, frankly speaking. I am not information about this type of discussion or replacement of Robin Hood with the carbon tax. Anyway, only to say that the costs related to the CO2 was non -- negligible, close to 0. So there is no impact for now.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Marco Porro (Executives)】\nI think we have exhausted more or less 2.5 hours. So I think -- thank you, everybody. And anyways, if you have additional questions, please contact the IR Department. And just remember that the press conference will follow shortly on the same location. Thank you. Bye-bye, everybody.",

Before starting, please switch off your mobile phones for technical reasons. So we can start the event, so let me introduce our president, Catia Bastioli.\n\n---\n\nGood afternoon, everybody, and welcome to the presentation of Terna's Strategic Plan and Full Year Results. As you know, this is our first Strategic Plan of Terna's first board of directors. And I like to thank the board members and our management team as well as everyone who is here today and the people who are connected from Italy. The new other thing is that we are in London. This is the first presentation in London and this is a natural choice because 90% of our institutional Investor Days with all the foreign investors and a major part of them work in London. I would now like to introduce my colleagues, and first of all on the stage, Matteo del Fante, who is the CEO of Terna. Matteo, he will come to the stage. And then Pierpaolo Cristofori, who is the Chief Financial Officer of Terna. And in all, we have also board members and also the management team of Terna. So good morning -- good afternoon to everyone.\r\nToday's agenda consists of a very short introduction on my side and then the full year results and then the strategic plan. The information that you will see confirms that Terna is a company of [indiscernible] and is a situation to become the best in class in returns [indiscernible] but also in terms of service to the Italian [indiscernible]. \r\nWhen I arrived in Terna, I found a very strong and stable business. This is a very good basis for [indiscernible], for exploiting the new opportunities from the business point of view and the decisions [ph] of the company so high that it is possible to seize new types of challenges. When I had achieved a balance in delivering strong financial results. However, these types of results is not just due to skills in financial and economical [indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nThank you, Catia, thank you, everyone and good afternoon. Thank you for being here. I will start with a very short feature of our results of 2014 and [indiscernible] by our board. It's a strong sense of results. We are speaking of course across 4 metrics. Revenue achieved just shy of EUR 2 billion. We had a 5.3% [indiscernible] It was the highest contribution on activities by regulated and non-regulated activities and net of Tamini consolidations, it's still a positive result on the revenue side. And that is driving the margin increase of the EBITDA level, and 6% increase of the bottom line was in EUR 545 million net profit for the year. We got here basically with the EUR 1.1 billion CapEx in line with the plan, slightly lower than 2013. The CapEx was a standard breakdown of 80% development of the grid, 12% maintenance and other than [indiscernible], over 300 kilometers of lines and 16 substations. We had a very important increase in CapEx deployment on storage solutions. We reached end of last year over EUR 150 million investment in storage and we now run from 1st of January active the largest storage equipment in Europe for 25 megabytes [ph]. \r\nFinally we show you the cash flow. We generated [indiscernible].\r\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nThank you and very good afternoon to everybody. As Matteo just said, 2014 has been a very good year by several measures. [indiscernible] let's see the revenues. On the revenues side, we see here we did almost EUR 2 billion here that caused [indiscernible]. We will get into the details of this plan, across the plan's presentation so we can hear from Matteo afterwards. The difference, which is EUR 11 million, refers to the usual salary dynamics and the provisions that we did across the year. Extent of costs amounted to approximately EUR 137 million with an increase of EUR 5 million as opposed to last year. Most of that, 4 of them were attributable to non-regulated activities, where, as you remember from prior slides, the difference of revenues of EUR 26 million, so that is related -- possible it's also related to other aspects. On the other cost, we reduced the total amount by EUR 9 million. Again, here, we have substantial lower penalties for the record that we did this year on quality of service, which more than offset an accrual that we did for local taxes and some other no regarding effect. So in essence, if we look overall at revenues and operating expenses, the -- we can say that the improvement in performance and the additional margins that we extracted from the nonregulated activities allowed us to accrue resources for the future cost structure of the company. In other words, we are investing on our people and our future of the company, without, of course, hitting profitability in this year.\r\nAnd in fact, if you move to the next slide, you will see that EBITDA is slightly better than last year, EUR 3 million better than last year, notwithstanding the substantial provision that we did on the labor cost. And stands at approximately EUR 1.5 billion with an EBITDA margin at approximately 75%. Depreciation and amortization amounted to EUR 480 million, up EUR 30 million versus last year as a consequence of the EUR 1.1 billion investments that we did across 2013, 2014. So as a consequence of that, EBIT was slightly down last year, most of it is attributable to the additional depreciation and amortization that we had accounted in the last year.\r\nOn the financial side, financial expenses were up EUR 28 million, mainly because of the lower financial income, which is given by the expected lower yield on the invested cash. So if you look at the gross debt and the cost of the gross debt, it actually got down as opposed to last year whereby we were less efficient, so to say, because of the decrease in the yields on the active side.\r\nCost of gross debt has been broadly stable at 2.3% whereby on the net side, cost of gross debt\r\n[Audio Gap]\r\nOn the tax side, we total it approximately EUR 340 million, with a sharp decrease as opposed to last year, less than -- more than EUR 18 million lower than last year, as a consequence of 2 effects, I would say. One is the decrease in the tax rate of the Robin Hood percentage, which went down during the year from 10.5% to 6.5%, and which yielded approximately 1/2 of the difference, more or less EUR 35 million. And we benefited as well from a positive adjustment of the deferred tax fund that we did over past investments due to the cancellation of the Robin Hood Tax, which happened in the first quarter of this year, but we had to account as well for the last year.\r\n[Audio Gap]\r\nAs a result of that, our net income was up EUR 30 million, i.e. 6% vis-à-vis last year. And corresponding, as I said, that will increase of 6%.\r\nIf you move to the next slide, we will see the investment. On investment side, we invested more than EUR 1 billion, EUR 1.1 billion, across the year. Most of it on the regulated activities, actually 96% on the regulated side, where 80% of the investments refer to development of the grid and as such, they carry a special incentive, as you know. So that's the mix of what we did do last year.\r\nMatteo has already shown some, but among the main ongoing projects that we delivered this year, we followed on the interconnection between Italy and Montenegro, [indiscernible] the cable between Sicily and Mainland. And of course, the additional amount that we spent on the storage systems as Matteo was pointing earlier, EUR 90 million this year.\r\nThe rest of the CapEx, approximately 20%, was spent on maintenance CapEx and as such, accounted with the base return.\r\nIf you look at the other CapEx, we spent more or less same amount in the last year that was referred to either nonregulated activities or capitalized financial charges, which we have to capitalize when we take into consideration long-term projects.\r\nI would move now to probably the most important slides, at least the slides I would like you to focus more for 2014, by the way, also the last slide, so -- and it's on free cash flow. That's a new measure that we are taking into account going forward. And if you look on the left side of the slide, you will see that on free cash flow, this year, we generated EUR 260 million worth of cash as opposed to actually absorption of cash last year as a combination of factor. But if you look at the different components, i.e., operating cash flow, working capital and CapEx, on all of the 3 components, we scored better than last year.\r\nOn operating cash flow, we had certainly a positive effect on the tax side, but as well, we had less cash cost as opposed to the last year.\r\nOn working capital, we had a bigger collection of receivables, included some referred to prior years and also a useful component, I would say, was an advance payment that we received in the last quarter of the year for a grant which was related to an investment innovations that we will complete during 2015 as an effort as we will see later in the plan for being able to attract also some special resources either for international or national funds to foster our capital expenditure program.\r\nAnd of course, the last component is the investment as we did EUR 100 million less investment than last year.\r\nAs a consequence of it, on the net debt side, we increased the debt by approximately slightly less than EUR 300 million, EUR 270 million, as opposed to almost EUR 800 million of the last year. And we were able to beat a little bit the forecast that we gave to you on the 9 months results. So we are slightly lower than EUR 7 billion as total net indebtedness, with cash and cash equivalents sitting at EUR 1.2 billion and with a total gross debt of EUR 8.2 billion that you see here as opposed to EUR 8.3 billion of the last year. So substantially stable in the total gross debt. We do not take into account though in this number the EUR 750 million of revolving credit facility that we committed by the end of the year and it is currently fully undrawn, but gives us a cushion of liquidity in order to fulfill our trading, as well, obligations.\r\nSo all in all, our financial structure remains solid. We have a residual average life of debt in excess of 5 years, 5.5 years, and a fixed floating ratio of 73% to -- 37%, which as you know has been consistently headed to our policy.\r\nLast and finally, Matteo already covered the point, we have confirmed the willingness to propose a dividend for this year of EUR 0.20 per share.\r\nThat's it. So I pass the bat to Matteo for the presentation on the plan. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nSo thank you, Pierpaolo. As a new CEO, I had the challenge to pause for a second, look at what Terna did since the IPO, 10 years. And what I discover is that we have filled the infrastructural gap in the electricity transmission space in Italy only in the last year, so we have invested in excess of EUR 8 billion. We have achieved through our investment very significant cost savings for the system, and we have done this providing an excellent result also for our shareholders with TSR above 300% in the period.\r\nThere are new challenges and we will discuss them briefly today. But what I want to confirm today is that the unchanged values and focus of Terna for the future will be to remain very conservative on risk taking and risk assessment and to focus and continue focusing on attractive and sustainable shareholder return.\r\nLooking at the challenges briefly, and I will spend a bit more time on each of them shortly.  We clearly have a new macroeconomic scenario, which is impacting our business in several aspect. We have an ongoing change in the electricity market, both at the Italian domestic\r\n[Audio Gap]\r\nOf the new regulatory period kicking in next year but the negotiations are, as you well know, happening during the course of this year.\r\nAnd what we have done in the plan, we have put on the table a set of management actions that are helping the bottom line of the company, the ability to generate free cash flow with the aim to sustain shareholder return. And the actions are divided, and we will spend more time today on the actions, which I think is what all of you are more interested to hear from us today, relate to increase discipline on our CapEx activities, increase -- and this is clearly an ongoing effort, but we are putting even more emphasis on OpEx discipline. We are going to have a strategy to be more selective on grid expansion, attracting also third-party financing to support our CapEx plan outside the tariff RAB. And we are putting the base for nonregulated activities to give an extra boost to our bottom line and allow us to face the challenges.\r\nSo I'll spend another very few minutes on the challenges and then we will really dig into the -- on the, sorry -- yes, and we will dig on the management actions later on.\r\nThe first challenge, as I said, is the macro scenario, low growth inflation bottoming. We start to see, and you are monitoring the space as much as we do, some preliminary signs of rebound for the economy overall, labor market, consumer confidence, hiring initiatives, that we probably and hopefully see at the energy demand level as well. In February, we registered a marginal increase on the month-over-month over 2014, we did 0.7 positive figure. Rates are very low. The Q -- the activities are bringing our 10-year risk-free rate at 1.3%. You have treasuries at almost 2%. U.S. treasuries and Italian BTPs at 1.3% is an issue for us. It's clearly, together with inflation, one of the parameters that are going into the regulatory framework, but I'm sure there are going to be question on this, so I will not spend time now on the specifics.\r\nThe second challenge or the second scenario that we face is the electricity market. And we believe that we need to look beyond Italy now. There is an energy union moving forward in Europe. We are focusing at the European level on security, solidarity and trust of supply. That goes and has to go through full integration of energy and we believe electricity grids, energy efficiency is a key theme across Europe. The council of Europe has set very specific target for 2030, as you know, 27% decrease on the consumption of energy. There is an ongoing theme on the integration of renewables that is affecting Terna in 2 ways. We need to develop the grid in such a way that we don't lose power generated by nonprogrammable renewables, but we have also to be very efficient on the dispatching market to make sure that those producers don't create problems in our balancing activities.\r\nAnd finally, there is a clear message at the European level that, as our president, Catia Bastioli stated, is also very present at Terna on research, innovation and following the European focus on a -- in a green agenda and the reduction of emissions across Europe.\r\nThe third challenge, which is clearly the one that is affecting us more directly and that's the one where we're spending the bulk of our time and attention in 2015, because it's clearly driving a lot what we will be able to make next year and the following, is the regulatory review. As you know, there was a preliminary 2015, '18 guidelines document that was generically referring to secure, efficient and flexible electricity market. There are references to the integration of the Italian grid with other European Union countries.\r\nBut as you are aware, in January there was a new document, the first consultation document setting the scene for what are the criteria, preliminary criteria, that the regulator is putting on the table to be shared with us, with the market and with the other companies affected by the new regulatory regime. And we start talking there about more selective approach to CapEx. That means potentially new incentives mechanism for future CapEx from 2016 onwards. There is the opportunity to increase the attractiveness of public financing, which was not very clear in the past. It has already been clarified in the gas space and, hopefully, it will happen in the electricity domain as well. There is a mention that has been welcomed by us, and I'm sure by the financial community as well, to consider extending the regulatory period from 4 to 6 years. We're fine with that. And there are signals that the regulatory framework could evolve into more sophisticated modern [indiscernible] output-based framework that, as you are very familiar with, had been tested in the more advanced countries in Europe. We are open to that. We have answered in a positive fashion, but it takes a bit of work to put down the metrics to actually implement the new regime.\r\nAnd let's now move on what we are planning to do, the actions. We have tried to organize the rest of the presentation in terms of actions in 4 pillars. CapEx discipline, how we are going to optimize our CapEx activities; grid expansion, with our usual ordinary RAB CapEx plan and third-party financing adding to that; the nonregulated business, with services, with the integration for the first year 2015 for 12 months of Tamini and interconnectors, so merchant lines that are funded by third parties and Terna plays an EPC role in the transaction; and finally, across the board, we want to bring discipline in the OpEx space and this relates to labor, organization and costs and external costs.\r\nIn dotted lines, we have -- we are pointing here to what we call potential upside in the plan. So what you see in dotted square box, the Italian railway high-voltage network is not in the plan in terms of figures. And same is not in the plan, other Italian and international EPC, BOOT business on transmission, energy efficiency and other interconnector facilities that we will be working on. All this is driving our bottom line and specifically, our EBITDA.\r\nPutting some numbers on the pillars. We are reviewing and lowering our CapEx plan for the 5 years to 3.2 versus 3.6 we announced 1 year ago. Grid expansion, we are lowering our growth rate from 5% to 3%, but that allows us to reach EUR 13.4 billion at the end of the period. And on traditional, we are showing here cumulated revenues of EUR 400 million for services, EUR 600 million for Tamini and EUR 400 million revenues of 1 EPC interconnector transaction.\r\nAnnually, and this will kick in gradually, but sooner than the end of the plan. For sure, we are targeting EUR 30 million annual\r\n \r\n[indiscernible]\r\nOn the regulated side, as all of you are aware, the most important project this year is the submarine link between Sicily and the continent that we're committed to deliver in 2015, and that would help, if you remember the beginning of my presentation, to bring also Sicily in a single market with no congestions with the rest of the continent.\r\nMoving to the nonregulated. We have the interconnections project going on. Most of you are aware that there is a specific law that is asking us, Terna, to perform EPC and to help private energy-intensive companies to build interconnections. And we're reserving to them space basically in our public lines, so the project will move along the lines of our public interconnections with France and Montenegro. In the figures, as you will see later, we are targeting a 10% standard EPC margin for this activity specifically, where we expect, and that's why we also put the European flag, we are expecting also to have support from European funds.\r\nIn natural, I would say a logic grid extension transaction is the potential acquisition, which I repeat is not in our figures today of the Italian railway high-voltage network. The rational transaction, we believe, is very clear, optimization in terms of CapEx deployment. We can provide energy to the railways. Their network can support or can help in some specific areas improve the national grid. So it's something that would make a lot of sense for the system.\r\nAnd second efficiency that we will create is that we will be able to maintain reorganizing, and this is part of what Pierpaolo anticipated, our focus on organization and labor efficiency, reorganizing our workforce because, at the moment, we are negotiating a transaction without the transfer of headcount in the perimeter of the deal.\r\nThe assets that are owned currently by Ferrovie are more than 9,000 kilometers of lines. They own more than 400 primary stations, but the process at the moment is in the hands of the regulator that is assessing also with the help of external technical support the value of the grid for the system in order to quantify a RAB and allowed return link to the RAB. And Terna will come in at that point. So for us, there is no transaction on the table until, obviously, we have a formal recognition from the regulator of what we are buying and how much what we are buying is going to yield us in terms of revenues.\r\nThe third pillar is nonregulated. And here, I repeat, our unchanged value and focus. We're going to be capital-light and keep a very low risk profile in the space. But we still wanted today to give you more concrete and meaningful numbers for the 3 main business lines that we have on nontraditionals where we are doing currently a lot of work to get those activities, especially the upside potential you don't see in the numbers, but believe me, in that bottom part of the page, there is a lot of attention and a lot of efforts from our management. But going back to what you see in the numbers, what we are committing to the market today, we have 3 business lines, as anticipated. In nontraditional, we have services that will cumulate EUR 400 million over the plan and we are assuming a 50% EBITDA margin. We have the consolidation for the full plan of Tamini at the moment, targeting a 10% margin on EUR 600 million revenues. And we have the interconnector I mentioned.\r\nIt's also very important to say that on nontraditional, the focus we are putting is both domestically and abroad on leveraging on the core capabilities of Terna. So if we want to go out of our core business that I think makes all of us, you as investor and us as management, very comfortable, if we want to go out, we believe that we want to go out with a competitive edge, and the competitive edge of Terna is the excellence in transmission. As you might remember, we were the second operator in Brazil and we still have employees. They are asking us, the employees, only a few weeks ago to go and support the operation even if we have sold, that we have no financial or legal obligation to do that, but we'll still send in our experts to support. And I can mention those and some examples where our expertise is required in the specific domain of transmission. So we are now looking outside Italy. We will support national champions such as in the energy space, our large ENI and any large companies, giving them support in the regions they are for transmission. And this is welcomed by them when we go there with the specific expertise.\r\nThe same mindset we will keep in Italy, leveraging on our technical expertise and always with possibly an EPC approach, basically putting no capital on the table, or if need be, looking at owning after having built that infrastructure but with an exit down the road with very rigorous, and I'm sure you'll believe me because that's what Terna has always done in the past, a very rigorous financial and asset and capital allocation metrics that we will put on the table every time we look at an investment on the upside potential. And energy efficiency falls into this space as well because we believe that as a European trend, there is something we can do specifically in Italy. We don't think we have any specific acts to go around the world to solve energy efficiency issues, but I think we can do something in Italy with our large clients, clients that on the next page are already giving contracts to Terna.\r\nSo I'm moving now to the second line of business in the nontraditional, the services, starting from the bottom, the O&M, this is basically activities that we do for large energy consumers and we basically maintain and service the primary stations.  We do the same for large PV projects, starting with the one we sold that all of you will remember with a lot of satisfaction a few years ago.\r\nThe EPC business is important and in the service space is based in Italy and abroad. And of the EUR 400 million in the plan, this could be as much as 50%. And specifically, we have recurring business of -- in the TLC space where we basically host optical fibers on our lines. All this business and we're being very conservative here, we're just looking on what we can touch, what we have basically on our hands, without being too optimistic, we cumulate and we are assuming cumulating EUR 400 million of revenues in the plan for 50% margin.\r\nTamini. We believe that we are getting into the -- we bought the company 1 year ago and we're getting into the possibility to get a real turnaround, which is not a turnaround because the company was and very successful from a financial standpoint point of view only a few months or years ago, now is coming back retaining a very strong technical expertise also on the financial side. We're looking at the recent figures on revenues and backlog, and we see the first positive signs of our presence. We recently appointed a very experienced CEO, Mr. Alberto Iperti, that I'm very happy to have with us today in London, with a very strong experience from Tenova and Tenaris before joining us and leading Tamini for Terna.\r\nWhat -- I'm sure you're all aware, but couple of words on what Tamini does, unique expertise globally in transformers, industrial transformers, where in some regions or in some industries, the market share is probably the highest globally in some specific regions. So we are very good at industrial transformers and the power transformers. In excess of 8,000 transformers sold around the world, 90 countries, and 60% revenues based outside Italy. So strong base to bring this excellent company back to produce an EBITDA margin that would create additional value through the incorporation for Terna.\r\nWe now move to the fourth pillar, which is, if you remember, the OpEx discipline. And I anticipated OpEx is organizational work and labor cost on one hand and external cost on the other. As Pierpaolo pointed out, we posted EUR 37 million accrual expense in 2014 for a voluntary turnover program. We have a total headcount of around 3,500. The plan will allow at least 300 employees to reach retirement a few years ahead of the due date that requires some efforts, financial efforts on our side that we expense in 2014. And that will allow us to hire a new generation of 200 people joining the firm, with a significant delta in terms of employee cost that goes down at EUR 20 million per annum when the full measure is in place. This gives us an excellent opportunity to, at the same time, put in place a new organization starting from the top. And I remind you that we did -- we officially stated last year, we did an initial cost-cutting initiative at the level of the governance and top management last year that resulted in some EUR 6 million of savings to start with. But starting from the top, the management, the staffing, we're creating a new organization where we give accountability and centralized services. So we have clear functions of the companies within the group, which was there already, to be blunt. But what was not there was clear responsibility on services. So we had functions that were spread around the companies in the group. Now we have decided which company in the group is best and is most suited to do a specific function and we have located the function to the group, and this is creating resources that will allow us also to support the growth of the nontraditional activities in terms of headcount, obviously.\r\nWe are optimizing all the operational aspect. This is an ongoing project with 3,200 people working on the ground. The optimization is something that can make you saving and be more efficient quite substantially.\r\nThe second action we're doing on optimizing our OpEx is on external cost. This is, I will say, more than housekeeping. We have looked carefully on our services contract and we have revised them. We have reviewed our fleet management cost and we are optimizing it. We have centralized IT and that you know in companies that are very IT-intensive and Terna is clearly spread out all around the country with only \"3,200 people,\" so we need to be very smart and efficient in IT and we are now centralizing the function and having a different organization around it. And we have renegotiated some extensive contracts that we could reduce in terms of cost for Terna. All in all, another EUR 10 million going to our EBITDA.\r\nAnd to summarize on the additional activities, I will say the nontraditional would increase and more than double the contribution to the total revenues of the firm at the end of 2019. We are indicating more than 10%. Otherwise, you are too fast to reverse engineer all our figures. But it's more than double, that we can tell you, of nonregulated revenues in 2019 versus what we approved today in 2014.\r\nSumming up, the EUR 20 million on labor and the EUR 10 million on external cost is EUR 30 million additional. And all this is creating additional support to our EBITDA basis and to our cash flow, which, as Pierpaolo anticipated, is something we work on carefully. And as you can see, the projection of our cash flow over the period are on the positive. We will move from an operating cash flow positive to a free cash flow positive over the course of the plan. And from 2018, we will manage to reduce, you see the red line going above the threshold, we are going to start reducing the net indebtedness.\r\nIn figures, that means creating in excess of EUR 2 billion of free cash flow to fund EUR 3.2 billion of CapEx -- after having funded, sorry, EUR 3.2 billion of CapEx. But the EUR 2 billion, other than supporting our financial charges, as I anticipated, allow us to retain a very ample and significant flexibility to sustain our shareholder return and dividend objectives.\r\nFor the first time, we, shortly, I can anticipate that we're going to show you also the 2015 guidance. But you need to give me another 15 seconds of patience. This is a KPI credit metrics. We stick to a very conservative balance sheet. We are assuming to plan a 2% cost of debt, and that compares to the 2.5% we have experienced on a net-net basis in 2014. This is due to the fact that cost of money today is much lower and we have some redemptions moving forward that will allow us to basically refinance at a lower level. And that translates into an improvement of funds from operation over net debt, increasing to 15%, which is welcomed by rating agencies and a basically stable net debt to calendar RAB but within the 60% threshold that the market is considering a meaningful one for companies in our space.\r\nAnd here we go with the guidance. We decided to do it this year, because we think it's something we feel comfortable to guide today. There is no regulatory uncertainty related to these figures with revenues breaching, for the first time in Terna's history, the EUR 2 billion threshold, EUR 2.05 billion around, the EBITDA breaching the EUR 1.5 billion threshold, reducing by another EUR 100 million CapEx. You remember, we had 1,100 in 2014. We're going down to EUR 1 billion. And tariff to RAB to increase to EUR 12.3 billion from EUR 11.6 billion that we have on tariff RAB end of this year. All in all to confirm for 2015 the EUR 0.20 per share dividend.\r\nSo in summary, we had modernized the Italian economy through our electricity grid CapEx, and that has allowed Terna to become a leading player in the space. We are the largest independent and one of the largest player in Europe. The business plan we present you today is based on some very specific management actions and KPIs that we have put on the table and aims to produce free cash flow for our investor base. But we believe that there is more upside and we're working on the upside, as I told you, from the nonregulated business and potential new opportunities such as the railway network.\r\nIn a nutshell, I was thinking this morning, how about owning -- being paid for owning a long call option. I think this is what Terna is today. So you get paid a healthy dividend for being long -- a call option on new activities that we'll bring to the table over the plan. Thank you very much. And now, I hand on to Mr. Antonio Colombi for the Q&A session.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Antonio Colombi (Executives)】\nThank you. Good afternoon and welcome, everybody, to Terna's 2014 Full Year Results and Strategic Plan Presentation. I am Antonio Colombi, Head of Investor Relations. Before starting, please switch off your mobile phones for technical reasons. So we can start the event, so let me introduce our president, Catia Bastioli.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Catia Bastioli (Executives)】\nGood afternoon, everybody, and welcome to the presentation of Terna's Strategic Plan and Full Year Results. As you know, this is our first Strategic Plan of Terna's first board of directors. And I like to thank the board members and our management team as well as everyone who is here today and the people who are connected from Italy. The new other thing is that we are in London. This is the first presentation in London and this is a natural choice because 90% of our institutional Investor Days with all the foreign investors and a major part of them work in London. I would now like to introduce my colleagues, and first of all on the stage, Matteo del Fante, who is the CEO of Terna. Matteo, he will come to the stage. And then Pierpaolo Cristofori, who is the Chief Financial Officer of Terna. And in all, we have also board members and also the management team of Terna. So good morning -- good afternoon to everyone.\r\nToday's agenda consists of a very short introduction on my side and then the full year results and then the strategic plan. The information that you will see confirms that Terna is a company of [indiscernible] and is a situation to become the best in class in returns [indiscernible] but also in terms of service to the Italian [indiscernible]. \r\nWhen I arrived in Terna, I found a very strong and stable business. This is a very good basis for [indiscernible], for exploiting the new opportunities from the business point of view and the decisions [ph] of the company so high that it is possible to seize new types of challenges. When I had achieved a balance in delivering strong financial results. However, these types of results is not just due to skills in financial and economical [indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Matteo del Fante (Executives)】\nThank you, Catia, thank you, everyone and good afternoon. Thank you for being here. I will start with a very short feature of our results of 2014 and [indiscernible] by our board. It's a strong sense of results. We are speaking of course across 4 metrics. Revenue achieved just shy of EUR 2 billion. We had a 5.3% [indiscernible] It was the highest contribution on activities by regulated and non-regulated activities and net of Tamini consolidations, it's still a positive result on the revenue side. And that is driving the margin increase of the EBITDA level, and 6% increase of the bottom line was in EUR 545 million net profit for the year. We got here basically with the EUR 1.1 billion CapEx in line with the plan, slightly lower than 2013. The CapEx was a standard breakdown of 80% development of the grid, 12% maintenance and other than [indiscernible], over 300 kilometers of lines and 16 substations. We had a very important increase in CapEx deployment on storage solutions. We reached end of last year over EUR 150 million investment in storage and we now run from 1st of January active the largest storage equipment in Europe for 25 megabytes [ph]. \r\nFinally we show you the cash flow. We generated [indiscernible].\r\n[indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Pierpaolo Cristofori (Executives)】\nThank you and very good afternoon to everybody. As Matteo just said, 2014 has been a very good year by several measures. [indiscernible] let's see the revenues. On the revenues side, we see here we did almost EUR 2 billion here that caused [indiscernible]. We will get into the details of this plan, across the plan's presentation so we can hear from Matteo afterwards. The difference, which is EUR 11 million, refers to the usual salary dynamics and the provisions that we did across the year. Extent of costs amounted to approximately EUR 137 million with an increase of EUR 5 million as opposed to last year. Most of that, 4 of them were attributable to non-regulated activities, where, as you remember from prior slides, the difference of revenues of EUR 26 million, so that is related -- possible it's also related to other aspects. On the other cost, we reduced the total amount by EUR 9 million. Again, here, we have substantial lower penalties for the record that we did this year on quality of service, which more than offset an accrual that we did for local taxes and some other no regarding effect. So in essence, if we look overall at revenues and operating expenses, the -- we can say that the improvement in performance and the additional margins that we extracted from the nonregulated activities allowed us to accrue resources for the future cost structure of the company. In other words, we are investing on our people and our future of the company, without, of course, hitting profitability in this year.\r\nAnd in fact, if you move to the next slide, you will see that EBITDA is slightly better than last year, EUR 3 million better than last year, notwithstanding the substantial provision that we did on the labor cost. And stands at approximately EUR 1.5 billion with an EBITDA margin at approximately 75%. Depreciation and amortization amounted to EUR 480 million, up EUR 30 million versus last year as a consequence of the EUR 1.1 billion investments that we did across 2013, 2014. So as a consequence of that, EBIT was slightly down last year, most of it is attributable to the additional depreciation and amortization that we had accounted in the last year.\r\nOn the financial side, financial expenses were up EUR 28 million, mainly because of the lower financial income, which is given by the expected lower yield on the invested cash. So if you look at the gross debt and the cost of the gross debt, it actually got down as opposed to last year whereby we were less efficient, so to say, because of the decrease in the yields on the active side.\r\nCost of gross debt has been broadly stable at 2.3% whereby on the net side, cost of gross debt\r\n[Audio Gap]\r\nOn the tax side, we total it approximately EUR 340 million, with a sharp decrease as opposed to last year, less than -- more than EUR 18 million lower than last year, as a consequence of 2 effects, I would say. One is the decrease in the tax rate of the Robin Hood percentage, which went down during the year from 10.5% to 6.5%, and which yielded approximately 1/2 of the difference, more or less EUR 35 million. And we benefited as well from a positive adjustment of the deferred tax fund that we did over past investments due to the cancellation of the Robin Hood Tax, which happened in the first quarter of this year, but we had to account as well for the last year.\r\n[Audio Gap]\r\nAs a result of that, our net income was up EUR 30 million, i.e. 6% vis-à-vis last year. And corresponding, as I said, that will increase of 6%.\r\nIf you move to the next slide, we will see the investment. On investment side, we invested more than EUR 1 billion, EUR 1.1 billion, across the year. Most of it on the regulated activities, actually 96% on the regulated side, where 80% of the investments refer to development of the grid and as such, they carry a special incentive, as you know. So that's the mix of what we did do last year.\r\nMatteo has already shown some, but among the main ongoing projects that we delivered this year, we followed on the interconnection between Italy and Montenegro, [indiscernible] the cable between Sicily and Mainland. And of course, the additional amount that we spent on the storage systems as Matteo was pointing earlier, EUR 90 million this year.\r\nThe rest of the CapEx, approximately 20%, was spent on maintenance CapEx and as such, accounted with the base return.\r\nIf you look at the other CapEx, we spent more or less same amount in the last year that was referred to either nonregulated activities or capitalized financial charges, which we have to capitalize when we take into consideration long-term projects.\r\nI would move now to probably the most important slides, at least the slides I would like you to focus more for 2014, by the way, also the last slide, so -- and it's on free cash flow. That's a new measure that we are taking into account going forward. And if you look on the left side of the slide, you will see that on free cash flow, this year, we generated EUR 260 million worth of cash as opposed to actually absorption of cash last year as a combination of factor. But if you look at the different components, i.e., operating cash flow, working capital and CapEx, on all of the 3 components, we scored better than last year.\r\nOn operating cash flow, we had certainly a positive effect on the tax side, but as well, we had less cash cost as opposed to the last year.\r\nOn working capital, we had a bigger collection of receivables, included some referred to prior years and also a useful component, I would say, was an advance payment that we received in the last quarter of the year for a grant which was related to an investment innovations that we will complete during 2015 as an effort as we will see later in the plan for being able to attract also some special resources either for international or national funds to foster our capital expenditure program.\r\nAnd of course, the last component is the investment as we did EUR 100 million less investment than last year.\r\nAs a consequence of it, on the net debt side, we increased the debt by approximately slightly less than EUR 300 million, EUR 270 million, as opposed to almost EUR 800 million of the last year. And we were able to beat a little bit the forecast that we gave to you on the 9 months results. So we are slightly lower than EUR 7 billion as total net indebtedness, with cash and cash equivalents sitting at EUR 1.2 billion and with a total gross debt of EUR 8.2 billion that you see here as opposed to EUR 8.3 billion of the last year. So substantially stable in the total gross debt. We do not take into account though in this number the EUR 750 million of revolving credit facility that we committed by the end of the year and it is currently fully undrawn, but gives us a cushion of liquidity in order to fulfill our trading, as well, obligations.\r\nSo all in all, our financial structure remains solid. We have a residual average life of debt in excess of 5 years, 5.5 years, and a fixed floating ratio of 73% to -- 37%, which as you know has been consistently headed to our policy.\r\nLast and finally, Matteo already covered the point, we have confirmed the willingness to propose a dividend for this year of EUR 0.20 per share.\r\nThat's it. So I pass the bat to Matteo for the presentation on the plan. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Matteo del Fante (Executives)】\nSo thank you, Pierpaolo. As a new CEO, I had the challenge to pause for a second, look at what Terna did since the IPO, 10 years. And what I discover is that we have filled the infrastructural gap in the electricity transmission space in Italy only in the last year, so we have invested in excess of EUR 8 billion. We have achieved through our investment very significant cost savings for the system, and we have done this providing an excellent result also for our shareholders with TSR above 300% in the period.\r\nThere are new challenges and we will discuss them briefly today. But what I want to confirm today is that the unchanged values and focus of Terna for the future will be to remain very conservative on risk taking and risk assessment and to focus and continue focusing on attractive and sustainable shareholder return.\r\nLooking at the challenges briefly, and I will spend a bit more time on each of them shortly.  We clearly have a new macroeconomic scenario, which is impacting our business in several aspect. We have an ongoing change in the electricity market, both at the Italian domestic\r\n[Audio Gap]\r\nOf the new regulatory period kicking in next year but the negotiations are, as you well know, happening during the course of this year.\r\nAnd what we have done in the plan, we have put on the table a set of management actions that are helping the bottom line of the company, the ability to generate free cash flow with the aim to sustain shareholder return. And the actions are divided, and we will spend more time today on the actions, which I think is what all of you are more interested to hear from us today, relate to increase discipline on our CapEx activities, increase -- and this is clearly an ongoing effort, but we are putting even more emphasis on OpEx discipline. We are going to have a strategy to be more selective on grid expansion, attracting also third-party financing to support our CapEx plan outside the tariff RAB. And we are putting the base for nonregulated activities to give an extra boost to our bottom line and allow us to face the challenges.\r\nSo I'll spend another very few minutes on the challenges and then we will really dig into the -- on the, sorry -- yes, and we will dig on the management actions later on.\r\nThe first challenge, as I said, is the macro scenario, low growth inflation bottoming. We start to see, and you are monitoring the space as much as we do, some preliminary signs of rebound for the economy overall, labor market, consumer confidence, hiring initiatives, that we probably and hopefully see at the energy demand level as well. In February, we registered a marginal increase on the month-over-month over 2014, we did 0.7 positive figure. Rates are very low. The Q -- the activities are bringing our 10-year risk-free rate at 1.3%. You have treasuries at almost 2%. U.S. treasuries and Italian BTPs at 1.3% is an issue for us. It's clearly, together with inflation, one of the parameters that are going into the regulatory framework, but I'm sure there are going to be question on this, so I will not spend time now on the specifics.\r\nThe second challenge or the second scenario that we face is the electricity market. And we believe that we need to look beyond Italy now. There is an energy union moving forward in Europe. We are focusing at the European level on security, solidarity and trust of supply. That goes and has to go through full integration of energy and we believe electricity grids, energy efficiency is a key theme across Europe. The council of Europe has set very specific target for 2030, as you know, 27% decrease on the consumption of energy. There is an ongoing theme on the integration of renewables that is affecting Terna in 2 ways. We need to develop the grid in such a way that we don't lose power generated by nonprogrammable renewables, but we have also to be very efficient on the dispatching market to make sure that those producers don't create problems in our balancing activities.\r\nAnd finally, there is a clear message at the European level that, as our president, Catia Bastioli stated, is also very present at Terna on research, innovation and following the European focus on a -- in a green agenda and the reduction of emissions across Europe.\r\nThe third challenge, which is clearly the one that is affecting us more directly and that's the one where we're spending the bulk of our time and attention in 2015, because it's clearly driving a lot what we will be able to make next year and the following, is the regulatory review. As you know, there was a preliminary 2015, '18 guidelines document that was generically referring to secure, efficient and flexible electricity market. There are references to the integration of the Italian grid with other European Union countries.\r\nBut as you are aware, in January there was a new document, the first consultation document setting the scene for what are the criteria, preliminary criteria, that the regulator is putting on the table to be shared with us, with the market and with the other companies affected by the new regulatory regime. And we start talking there about more selective approach to CapEx. That means potentially new incentives mechanism for future CapEx from 2016 onwards. There is the opportunity to increase the attractiveness of public financing, which was not very clear in the past. It has already been clarified in the gas space and, hopefully, it will happen in the electricity domain as well. There is a mention that has been welcomed by us, and I'm sure by the financial community as well, to consider extending the regulatory period from 4 to 6 years. We're fine with that. And there are signals that the regulatory framework could evolve into more sophisticated modern [indiscernible] output-based framework that, as you are very familiar with, had been tested in the more advanced countries in Europe. We are open to that. We have answered in a positive fashion, but it takes a bit of work to put down the metrics to actually implement the new regime.\r\nAnd let's now move on what we are planning to do, the actions. We have tried to organize the rest of the presentation in terms of actions in 4 pillars. CapEx discipline, how we are going to optimize our CapEx activities; grid expansion, with our usual ordinary RAB CapEx plan and third-party financing adding to that; the nonregulated business, with services, with the integration for the first year 2015 for 12 months of Tamini and interconnectors, so merchant lines that are funded by third parties and Terna plays an EPC role in the transaction; and finally, across the board, we want to bring discipline in the OpEx space and this relates to labor, organization and costs and external costs.\r\nIn dotted lines, we have -- we are pointing here to what we call potential upside in the plan. So what you see in dotted square box, the Italian railway high-voltage network is not in the plan in terms of figures. And same is not in the plan, other Italian and international EPC, BOOT business on transmission, energy efficiency and other interconnector facilities that we will be working on. All this is driving our bottom line and specifically, our EBITDA.\r\nPutting some numbers on the pillars. We are reviewing and lowering our CapEx plan for the 5 years to 3.2 versus 3.6 we announced 1 year ago. Grid expansion, we are lowering our growth rate from 5% to 3%, but that allows us to reach EUR 13.4 billion at the end of the period. And on traditional, we are showing here cumulated revenues of EUR 400 million for services, EUR 600 million for Tamini and EUR 400 million revenues of 1 EPC interconnector transaction.\r\nAnnually, and this will kick in gradually, but sooner than the end of the plan. For sure, we are targeting EUR 30 million annual\r\n \r\n[indiscernible]\r\nOn the regulated side, as all of you are aware, the most important project this year is the submarine link between Sicily and the continent that we're committed to deliver in 2015, and that would help, if you remember the beginning of my presentation, to bring also Sicily in a single market with no congestions with the rest of the continent.\r\nMoving to the nonregulated. We have the interconnections project going on. Most of you are aware that there is a specific law that is asking us, Terna, to perform EPC and to help private energy-intensive companies to build interconnections. And we're reserving to them space basically in our public lines, so the project will move along the lines of our public interconnections with France and Montenegro. In the figures, as you will see later, we are targeting a 10% standard EPC margin for this activity specifically, where we expect, and that's why we also put the European flag, we are expecting also to have support from European funds.\r\nIn natural, I would say a logic grid extension transaction is the potential acquisition, which I repeat is not in our figures today of the Italian railway high-voltage network. The rational transaction, we believe, is very clear, optimization in terms of CapEx deployment. We can provide energy to the railways. Their network can support or can help in some specific areas improve the national grid. So it's something that would make a lot of sense for the system.\r\nAnd second efficiency that we will create is that we will be able to maintain reorganizing, and this is part of what Pierpaolo anticipated, our focus on organization and labor efficiency, reorganizing our workforce because, at the moment, we are negotiating a transaction without the transfer of headcount in the perimeter of the deal.\r\nThe assets that are owned currently by Ferrovie are more than 9,000 kilometers of lines. They own more than 400 primary stations, but the process at the moment is in the hands of the regulator that is assessing also with the help of external technical support the value of the grid for the system in order to quantify a RAB and allowed return link to the RAB. And Terna will come in at that point. So for us, there is no transaction on the table until, obviously, we have a formal recognition from the regulator of what we are buying and how much what we are buying is going to yield us in terms of revenues.\r\nThe third pillar is nonregulated. And here, I repeat, our unchanged value and focus. We're going to be capital-light and keep a very low risk profile in the space. But we still wanted today to give you more concrete and meaningful numbers for the 3 main business lines that we have on nontraditionals where we are doing currently a lot of work to get those activities, especially the upside potential you don't see in the numbers, but believe me, in that bottom part of the page, there is a lot of attention and a lot of efforts from our management. But going back to what you see in the numbers, what we are committing to the market today, we have 3 business lines, as anticipated. In nontraditional, we have services that will cumulate EUR 400 million over the plan and we are assuming a 50% EBITDA margin. We have the consolidation for the full plan of Tamini at the moment, targeting a 10% margin on EUR 600 million revenues. And we have the interconnector I mentioned.\r\nIt's also very important to say that on nontraditional, the focus we are putting is both domestically and abroad on leveraging on the core capabilities of Terna. So if we want to go out of our core business that I think makes all of us, you as investor and us as management, very comfortable, if we want to go out, we believe that we want to go out with a competitive edge, and the competitive edge of Terna is the excellence in transmission. As you might remember, we were the second operator in Brazil and we still have employees. They are asking us, the employees, only a few weeks ago to go and support the operation even if we have sold, that we have no financial or legal obligation to do that, but we'll still send in our experts to support. And I can mention those and some examples where our expertise is required in the specific domain of transmission. So we are now looking outside Italy. We will support national champions such as in the energy space, our large ENI and any large companies, giving them support in the regions they are for transmission. And this is welcomed by them when we go there with the specific expertise.\r\nThe same mindset we will keep in Italy, leveraging on our technical expertise and always with possibly an EPC approach, basically putting no capital on the table, or if need be, looking at owning after having built that infrastructure but with an exit down the road with very rigorous, and I'm sure you'll believe me because that's what Terna has always done in the past, a very rigorous financial and asset and capital allocation metrics that we will put on the table every time we look at an investment on the upside potential. And energy efficiency falls into this space as well because we believe that as a European trend, there is something we can do specifically in Italy. We don't think we have any specific acts to go around the world to solve energy efficiency issues, but I think we can do something in Italy with our large clients, clients that on the next page are already giving contracts to Terna.\r\nSo I'm moving now to the second line of business in the nontraditional, the services, starting from the bottom, the O&M, this is basically activities that we do for large energy consumers and we basically maintain and service the primary stations.  We do the same for large PV projects, starting with the one we sold that all of you will remember with a lot of satisfaction a few years ago.\r\nThe EPC business is important and in the service space is based in Italy and abroad. And of the EUR 400 million in the plan, this could be as much as 50%. And specifically, we have recurring business of -- in the TLC space where we basically host optical fibers on our lines. All this business and we're being very conservative here, we're just looking on what we can touch, what we have basically on our hands, without being too optimistic, we cumulate and we are assuming cumulating EUR 400 million of revenues in the plan for 50% margin.\r\nTamini. We believe that we are getting into the -- we bought the company 1 year ago and we're getting into the possibility to get a real turnaround, which is not a turnaround because the company was and very successful from a financial standpoint point of view only a few months or years ago, now is coming back retaining a very strong technical expertise also on the financial side. We're looking at the recent figures on revenues and backlog, and we see the first positive signs of our presence. We recently appointed a very experienced CEO, Mr. Alberto Iperti, that I'm very happy to have with us today in London, with a very strong experience from Tenova and Tenaris before joining us and leading Tamini for Terna.\r\nWhat -- I'm sure you're all aware, but couple of words on what Tamini does, unique expertise globally in transformers, industrial transformers, where in some regions or in some industries, the market share is probably the highest globally in some specific regions. So we are very good at industrial transformers and the power transformers. In excess of 8,000 transformers sold around the world, 90 countries, and 60% revenues based outside Italy. So strong base to bring this excellent company back to produce an EBITDA margin that would create additional value through the incorporation for Terna.\r\nWe now move to the fourth pillar, which is, if you remember, the OpEx discipline. And I anticipated OpEx is organizational work and labor cost on one hand and external cost on the other. As Pierpaolo pointed out, we posted EUR 37 million accrual expense in 2014 for a voluntary turnover program. We have a total headcount of around 3,500. The plan will allow at least 300 employees to reach retirement a few years ahead of the due date that requires some efforts, financial efforts on our side that we expense in 2014. And that will allow us to hire a new generation of 200 people joining the firm, with a significant delta in terms of employee cost that goes down at EUR 20 million per annum when the full measure is in place. This gives us an excellent opportunity to, at the same time, put in place a new organization starting from the top. And I remind you that we did -- we officially stated last year, we did an initial cost-cutting initiative at the level of the governance and top management last year that resulted in some EUR 6 million of savings to start with. But starting from the top, the management, the staffing, we're creating a new organization where we give accountability and centralized services. So we have clear functions of the companies within the group, which was there already, to be blunt. But what was not there was clear responsibility on services. So we had functions that were spread around the companies in the group. Now we have decided which company in the group is best and is most suited to do a specific function and we have located the function to the group, and this is creating resources that will allow us also to support the growth of the nontraditional activities in terms of headcount, obviously.\r\nWe are optimizing all the operational aspect. This is an ongoing project with 3,200 people working on the ground. The optimization is something that can make you saving and be more efficient quite substantially.\r\nThe second action we're doing on optimizing our OpEx is on external cost. This is, I will say, more than housekeeping. We have looked carefully on our services contract and we have revised them. We have reviewed our fleet management cost and we are optimizing it. We have centralized IT and that you know in companies that are very IT-intensive and Terna is clearly spread out all around the country with only \"3,200 people,\" so we need to be very smart and efficient in IT and we are now centralizing the function and having a different organization around it. And we have renegotiated some extensive contracts that we could reduce in terms of cost for Terna. All in all, another EUR 10 million going to our EBITDA.\r\nAnd to summarize on the additional activities, I will say the nontraditional would increase and more than double the contribution to the total revenues of the firm at the end of 2019. We are indicating more than 10%. Otherwise, you are too fast to reverse engineer all our figures. But it's more than double, that we can tell you, of nonregulated revenues in 2019 versus what we approved today in 2014.\r\nSumming up, the EUR 20 million on labor and the EUR 10 million on external cost is EUR 30 million additional. And all this is creating additional support to our EBITDA basis and to our cash flow, which, as Pierpaolo anticipated, is something we work on carefully. And as you can see, the projection of our cash flow over the period are on the positive. We will move from an operating cash flow positive to a free cash flow positive over the course of the plan. And from 2018, we will manage to reduce, you see the red line going above the threshold, we are going to start reducing the net indebtedness.\r\nIn figures, that means creating in excess of EUR 2 billion of free cash flow to fund EUR 3.2 billion of CapEx -- after having funded, sorry, EUR 3.2 billion of CapEx. But the EUR 2 billion, other than supporting our financial charges, as I anticipated, allow us to retain a very ample and significant flexibility to sustain our shareholder return and dividend objectives.\r\nFor the first time, we, shortly, I can anticipate that we're going to show you also the 2015 guidance. But you need to give me another 15 seconds of patience. This is a KPI credit metrics. We stick to a very conservative balance sheet. We are assuming to plan a 2% cost of debt, and that compares to the 2.5% we have experienced on a net-net basis in 2014. This is due to the fact that cost of money today is much lower and we have some redemptions moving forward that will allow us to basically refinance at a lower level. And that translates into an improvement of funds from operation over net debt, increasing to 15%, which is welcomed by rating agencies and a basically stable net debt to calendar RAB but within the 60% threshold that the market is considering a meaningful one for companies in our space.\r\nAnd here we go with the guidance. We decided to do it this year, because we think it's something we feel comfortable to guide today. There is no regulatory uncertainty related to these figures with revenues breaching, for the first time in Terna's history, the EUR 2 billion threshold, EUR 2.05 billion around, the EBITDA breaching the EUR 1.5 billion threshold, reducing by another EUR 100 million CapEx. You remember, we had 1,100 in 2014. We're going down to EUR 1 billion. And tariff to RAB to increase to EUR 12.3 billion from EUR 11.6 billion that we have on tariff RAB end of this year. All in all to confirm for 2015 the EUR 0.20 per share dividend.\r\nSo in summary, we had modernized the Italian economy through our electricity grid CapEx, and that has allowed Terna to become a leading player in the space. We are the largest independent and one of the largest player in Europe. The business plan we present you today is based on some very specific management actions and KPIs that we have put on the table and aims to produce free cash flow for our investor base. But we believe that there is more upside and we're working on the upside, as I told you, from the nonregulated business and potential new opportunities such as the railway network.\r\nIn a nutshell, I was thinking this morning, how about owning -- being paid for owning a long call option. I think this is what Terna is today. So you get paid a healthy dividend for being long -- a call option on new activities that we'll bring to the table over the plan. Thank you very much. And now, I hand on to Mr. Antonio Colombi for the Q&A session.",
      "transcript_text3": "Thank you. So we can start the Q&A session. In order to make your question, please wait for the microphone. Please give your name and company name, speak loud and clear so everybody in the hall can understand your question. So we can start from Alberto?\n\n---\n\nAlberto Ponti, Societe Generale. Loud and clear enough, hopefully. I think, you're the first Italian company to actually came out with some sort of guidance on the numbers for the next regulatory period, so all the others have been sort of understandably so pretty silent. So my question really is, well, I know you're not going to give me the precise number, but can you give us some color in terms of what you're thinking about the returns for the next regulatory period? And the second question instead will be around CapEx incentives. The regulatory is proposing some changes. What are your thoughts about it?\n\n---\n\nI mean, the first question in terms of what we expect in terms of allowed return from the regulator, the new allowed return is a mix of components, and most of you have actually identified clearly the key driver. The market is focusing mainly on the risk-free rate, but allowed return is not only risk-free rate. And we believe that there are other parameters that needs attention and review from the regulator in order to come out with a fair return for the next regulatory period. What we can tell you is that we have done, obviously, simulations, sensitivities on several scenarios. And we believe we have a relatively strong business in place to face the review. But we also need to look at what happened in the past. I mean, there was a 7.4 allowed return in the previous period that has been already decreased to 6.3 only 2 years ago. And so now, there is going to be another increase. The question is, is it going to be of the same order of magnitude? Is it going to be slightly more or in that space? Hard to say. The issue for us is that we put on the table today some measures that are allowing the company to, one, be able to be relatively upfront with the regulator and say, look, we have started putting our house in order, so we have not waited next year to do the OpEx savings, which would be the natural behavior in a regulatory play in the industry. We started today because we want to be relatively transparent with the regulator and say that we are doing our best in the house, in the company, and we expect that this translates into a return that will allow us to perform the CapEx that we have already started reducing, as you have seen, but that the system needs. So there is a point where the excessive reduction is impacting our CapEx plan and capabilities. The second question on incentives, I think, is an interesting one because the document from the regulator in January is saying more selective on new incentives. We had to assume a stable regulatory framework in the plan, so I've shown you and I have specified that we are projecting stable incentives, but the regulator has stated that for future CapEx from 2016 onwards, they will be more selective. So that end of the plan mix 54% incentivized and 46% ordinary might be closer to a 50-50 kind of profile if the regulator decides that from next year we will have a different incentive mechanism. And we are open to discuss it with the regulator. And again, incentive is another of those parameters that are going into the allowed return. So I'm prepared to have less incentives, but maybe I would need to have more room on other parameters. So it's not a science, I think, it's more of an art.\n\n---\n\nThere, Monica Girardi.\n\n---\n\nMonica Girardi, Barclays. I have a few question. One goes back to the regulation and the dividend policy. I appreciate you are in the middle of a reregulation, so you may not be super explicit on that, but I will try to take out something. On the -- assuming that the regulator does not give to you a return that you consider to be satisfactory for whatever reason, do you have some flexibility in your CapEx to protect free cash flows and to grant a satisfactory return to shareholder anyway, i.e., what are your priorities in terms of between CapEx and dividends? The second question is on the international strategy. Last year, there was a great focus on the Greek privatization, which seems to be a bit of off the table for obvious reasons. I was wondering if you can just give us an update on what Terna maybe in the medium to long run might aspire to be in Europe? And last one on the refinancing, just a super quick question. Can you give us the assumption that you have in your plan in terms of maturity of lines that you are refinancing going forward, if you want to keep the 5.5 years tenor or if you are willing to go on a shorter maturity?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Starting with the first question is, I think, we are being relatively explicit today. Pending the regulatory review, we consider EUR 0.20 a solid basis for future dividend. So we think we have a business model and we have gone into details of our cash flow generation metrics that should make the market feel comfortable. In terms of Greece, one year ago, we had on the table a 700-ish million potential equity investment in Greece and there was the transaction that Terna was focusing on. In the meantime, we -- Greece has gone at the moment out of our agenda. But we have deployed time and resources and focus and potentially capital to the domestic grid extension initiative with Ferrovie dello Stato, with the national railway. So it's not a totally closed chapter, but now we are clearly giving a priority to the national railway transaction. And on the average maturity assumptions, I'll ask the CFO to support me.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you, Matteo. No, we are happy with the tenor that we have today. You'll know that we have substantial money coming due in 2017. And if I look at these spreads that we can enjoy today, we could have a substantial advantage going forward. We're looking into the math there, it doesn't mean that we'll do something about that. As of today, we're happy with the strategy that we are putting in place.\n\n---\n\nAntonella Bianchessi from Citigroup.\n\n---\n\nIt's Antonella from Citigroup. Just 3 question. The first one is on your credit metric. It seems to me that this plan is trying to optimize and to extract value from all the possibility that Terna has, but your credit metric are supposed to improve materially from 2017 onward. Do you think this is necessary? Or you think that the company should maintain a higher debt in order to reduce its cost of capital and given current market condition? The second question is that you will have regulatory framework that is set for the next 6 years, which probably will continue to allow the revision of your allowed return on a 2-year basis. How can you exploit the fact that you de facto-ed on type of huge bond risk exposure? You theoretically should shorten your debt and profit by this even if probably it's not the best things for the system in general but to play the regulatory game. The other question is on your new project. From the slide, it's not really clear if there is additional EBITDA compared to a 68 coming now because it looks like that the 50% margin is getting smaller and the other are bigger but the margin is lower. So if you can quantify the EBITDA of a new project, of a new initiative?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Not easy questions. The key metrics, at this point, we feel that we have to keep it strong because we have to be ready to see what will come out from the regulatory framework. So I'm sorry, in a way, to say, but I would like to give an answer, a detailed answer to most of the questions I receive in January, but I don't have to answer it now, we don't have time to wait until January. But what I can do from now to the end of the year, I can commit to keep a strong balance sheet. And if I have a benign or a relatively positive results from the regulator, I could consider optimization. The second question is about the rolling 2 years, which is an interesting consideration.  We keep our -- we basically split the average life of our debt from the risk exposure, and we cover risk only over the course of the regulatory period. And we will certainly do it more on the 2-year basis than the usual 4-year because the resetting now is rolling every 2 years. EBITDA, we believe, in terms of annual, that in the plan, at the end of the plan specifically, the known traditional activities will generate EUR 20 million additional EBITDA. So the EBITDA will improve by EUR 20 million from the nontraditional and around EUR 30 million from OpEx, so we're putting at the EBITDA level a EUR 50 million cushion towards the regulatory review decision.\n\n---\n\nStefano Gamberini.\n\n---\n\nStefano Gamberini, Equita SIM, 3 questions, if I may. First of all, regarding your CapEx, the Slide 22, if you can just give us an idea for what are the main projects you have inside the EUR 3.2 billion of investments? And also are you confident that all the investments could be realized in the period? And may I refer to the interconnection with Montenegro, how the project is going? The second, regarding the nontraditional, more or less it's the same question regarding the interconnection with France. So if I'm not wrong, you start to add the revenues from 2016, and so if you can update how are going the negotiations with the main investors in the project. The last one is regarding the acquisition of the railway network. You said that you have very strict financial criteria, so could you share with us what are these criteria? And my main question is, the RAB could be a ceiling of an acquisition of an offer that you can do because in this case we are speaking around a negotiation just between 2 parts, and probably to be clear, what is your target?\n\n---\n\nOkay. I will answer the second question if you allow me and then ask. The RAB of the railway network will be the starting point for our consideration on price together with the allowed return. What we have stated clearly is that we aim to obtain returns on the new investment that are comparable with the returns that our investor base is enjoying and benefiting in the current business plan. And that's clearly a positive outcome for us and that's what we are targeting. But at the end, there will be a minor negotiation process that eventually will take place and you have to trust us that we will do the best. At the end of the day, we have only 1 little advantage over the -- that we are the only listed player in this negotiation. And so we have to respect the interest of many investors, private and institutional, that are expecting our board and our company to create value for their share. On the second question, I will ask Gianni Armani, the CEO of Terna Rete Italia, to answer. The first question is the major projects and the second one is Montenegro/France.\n\n---\n\nThank you very much, Matteo. And first of all, on CapEx plan, more or less EUR 1 billion is -- of the EUR 3.2 billion is concentrated on interconnections, so Montenegro and France. Both of the lines will be in operations between 2018 and 2019, plus Montenegro is currently progressing. We laid down more or less 140 kilometers of sea cables, and the operations are going ahead both in Montenegro and in Italy. On the Italy-France interconnection, instead, we have awarded today to Prysmian the cable contract together with LTE, of course. And we are progressing also on the interconnector part of the link, that is the private line project for which we have the full mandate from the financer, both on asking the exemption, that is the right for extracting revenues from the line, and for operating on the financing part for all the project. And by the end of the year, we will have a news on this project.\n\n---\n\nAnna Maria Scaglia from Morgan Stanley.\n\n---\n\nIt's Anna Maria Scaglia from Morgan Stanley. Four questions, if I may. The first one is regarding your cash position in your balance sheet. So you keep having quite a lot of cash. So far, you have been able to get quite good returns, but I'm wondering what's your expectations during the plan? Are you thinking about reducing it? What's the rationale for keeping it? Or is there waiting for the FS grid acquisition? The second question is on regulation. We are not just waiting for the electricity regulation but also the allowed return regulation. Do you have any timeline for that? Any expectations when the document on the allowed return could be out? Third, you mentioned nonrecurring items in your revenue lines. I was wondering if you can clarify those? And last but not least, my impression is that with the acquisition of the FS grid, you could have CapEx savings in your plan. So I'm -- because the 2 lines going parallel, so I'm wondering whether your plan could change once you acquire the grid from FS?\n\n---\n\nSo I will take the last one, but maybe first, Pierpaolo, you want to answer the first and the second.\n\n---\n\nYes, on the cash position, as I said, year-end, we were at EUR 1.2 billion on top of an availability of additional EUR 700 million. And of course, we are trying to reduce our cash at minimum reasonabl because today, clearly, we don't enjoy any longer the investment rates that we used to enjoy in the past. So we decided to have available lines other than cash lines. If you look at and compare it year-on-year, we have already substantially reduced vis-à-vis last year. And in fact, we were able to decrease gross indebted vis-à-vis last year by EUR 100 million. So the amount of cash that we're willing to take on our books is the minimum that is needed in order to retain our rating figures at this point in time. So I don't want excess cash sitting on my books being idle. On the other end, in order to fuel whatever is necessary to do for either for this [ph] or additional opportunities that may materialize, rather than looking at cash, we would look at our ability to raise debt. We will -- we are already in the process of increasing our E&P program by an additional EUR 2 billion, which will come in a few weeks. So that would be allowing us to have in our formulation to support Matteo in the development plans that we'll have on the business.\n\n---\n\nAnd in terms of reviewing the CapEx plan, that was the last question, Anna Maria, on the back of the potential railway transaction, I think, it's a very fair question. And the answer is more or less, yes, in the sense that the optimization of the combined grids, we require the review of some of the projects we have in the EUR 3.2 billion, of some of the projects that we have in the 6.7. But it will have to be done after due diligence. So it's something that is very hard to do [indiscernible]. We will have to look side-by-side. I mean, Ferrovie is, from an operational standpoint, a very significant transaction, 9,000. And it might be that the RAB will be allowed for a smaller amount than 9,000, I don't know. But 9,000 kilometers over 63,000 is 15% of our size. So integrating 15% new grid in an existing grid is very important and very articulate operational exercise that will require a lot of focus and care, and that, at the end of the day, will have an impact also on the overall grid efficiency in the system because grids work better when they have more potential lines of contact and 15% increase of the current, if you think that in 2014 we have created only \"EUR 300 million,\" clearly very focused on solving bottlenecks. But EUR 300 million and the one shot we are acquiring 9,000 admits that it's significant. And therefore, I believe that the answer is, yes, but it's a yes that requires work \r\n[Audio Gap]\r\nis that our lines and the Ferrovie lines are taking on the ground. And as you know, in many places, given these grids have been put in place when there was less presence of industries or housing, these are important areas where you can have new infrastructures or new developments if you don't need the grid any longer.\n\n---\n\nThere was the last question, I guess, on 2014 numbers about the nonrecurring items. We're talking approximately EUR 8 million as a combination of 2 effects. One is we had less surpluses as opposed to last year, so half and half. And on the other hand, we have a release in some provisions that we did in the last years, I would say, and concerning in particular our prototype projects because we had some provisions to care for some risks that didn't materialize. So the sum of the 2 is a positive EUR 8 million. The rest of that is, as I said, additional EPC and OEM revenues. And the rest is basically the same in term of TLC revenues that we extract from our hosting contract.\n\n---\n\nThere.\n\n---\n\nStefano Bezzato, Crédit Suisse. Three questions, please. The first one on the abolition of the Robin Hood Tax, whether you see the risk of any other measure replacing it or negatively affecting Terna's profitability? And if that's not the case, would you be able to share with us the guidance for 2015 net income? The second question, on the 2014 results, if you can provide or disclose the recurring net income for 2014? And the last question on deferred taxes, the adjustment that you mentioned on your press release for 2014, if you can quantify that?\n\n---\n\nOkay. You got the second and the third? If you can repeat them, apologies, the second and the third question again, sorry.\n\n---\n\nOkay. The second question was on the 2014 results, if you can provide a recurring net income number? And the third question was on the deferred taxes. You mentioned on the press release that there is an adjustment on deferred taxes because of the Robin Hood Tax abolition, if you can quantify that?\n\n---\n\nYes, you gave me the third and the first, but I remember now the second one, which was actually, if we can give you guidance for 2015 net income. Let's start with that one. We haven't put it on the screen because we think it's a bit premature. What I can tell you is that we would committing to a EUR 0.20 dividend. We would be in the region of 70% payout, which ranks both in absolute terms, and I would add, on a relative basis, with other peers in Italy and abroad in the regulator space, will look very solid. The first question on the abolition of the Robin Hood Tax, we have no anticipation. We haven't seen any declaration by officials that this will be replaced. In a way, Terna only has paid in excess of EUR 300 million of additional taxes since the Robin Hood Tax was put in place and up to the date of the ruling. So one could say that the measure has created the extra revenues for the state in the middle of probably an overall difficult balance sheet and economic scenario for public finances. And maybe that scenario is now not so difficult. But it's really above us to make any forecast. And the question on recurrent net income number for 2014.\n\n---\n\nYes. Speaking on the answer that I gave before, on the revenue side, taking away quality for a second, if I take away quality both on the cost and the revenue side, basically, we are compensating a positive and negative vis-à-vis last year, because as I said, we benefited in revenues for approximately net EUR 8 million. And on top of that, on the -- while on the negative we had this year, we didn't have the benefit and we will not have the benefit going forward of some remuneration that we got in the prior years for the reduction of volumes in the dispatching market. If you take into account the extraordinary accrual of EUR 37 million, so bottom line, we basically funded that difference through the additional revenues that we got in quality. So exactly the last sentence they had on my slide. So this year, we had very strong quality. Does it happen every year? We don't know, because partially, it depends on us, partially, it doesn't. But this year, we used a fair amount of money that we were able to extract from the management of the network in order to fund that additional provision that we took on our books. All in all, the other things substantially compensate each other because we had something surplus, but we had accrued something else. And on top of that, on the negative side, we also did some additional provision from IMU, which is a lot of tax in Italy according to some degree that came along with the new tax at year-end. Would it materialize or not, we have something there. So bottom line, it wouldn't be any different, if anything, probably would be slightly better than anticipated.\n\n---\n\nMaurice Choy from Royal Bank of Canada.\n\n---\n\nThis is Maurice Choy from RBC Capital Markets. Two questions. First question is on dividend, second question is on CapEx. The first question, dividends, I remember last year the policy was EUR 0.19 plus 6% of payout for the nontraditional activities. And this year, that's changed to EUR 0.20 guidance. Can I just get a little understand of how you got to the change in your train of thought on dividends? That's the first question. And the second question on CapEx, Slide 20 shows you the CapEx for every single year. And I do notice that a little bit of a decrease from '15 all the way to '18 and a little bit of uptick into 2019. So I just wanted to understand what's driving that up? And should we consider that that should be continue rising up?\n\n---\n\nOn the dividend, it's very straightforward, we just wanted to make it easier. There was no specific material reason to put a weight, any \"risk\" on this very small portion of the dividend, the nontraditional. We will review after the regulatory ruling. Potentially, we can go back if we see the reason and we see -- but it's not something that we attach a lot of relevance. In terms of the CapEx, the answer is no. You have a blimp in 2019 for a very specific project that has a lump sum payment that we expect in 2019. But net of that project, we will expect CapEx to stabilize with decreasing trend in the EUR 500 million to EUR 400 million per annum.\n\n---\n\nSo seems no more questions. So thank you very much, and we'll see the first quarter results. Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\nThank you.",

What we can tell you is that we have done, obviously, simulations, sensitivities on several scenarios. And we believe we have a relatively strong business in place to face the review. But we also need to look at what happened in the past. I mean, there was a 7.4 allowed return in the previous period that has been already decreased to 6.3 only 2 years ago. And so now, there is going to be another increase. The question is, is it going to be of the same order of magnitude? Is it going to be slightly more or in that space? Hard to say. The issue for us is that we put on the table today some measures that are allowing the company to, one, be able to be relatively upfront with the regulator and say, look, we have started putting our house in order, so we have not waited next year to do the OpEx savings, which would be the natural behavior in a regulatory play in the industry. We started today because we want to be relatively transparent with the regulator and say that we are doing our best in the house, in the company, and we expect that this translates into a return that will allow us to perform the CapEx that we have already started reducing, as you have seen, but that the system needs. So there is a point where the excessive reduction is impacting our CapEx plan and capabilities. The second question on incentives, I think, is an interesting one because the document from the regulator in January is saying more selective on new incentives. We had to assume a stable regulatory framework in the plan, so I've shown you and I have specified that we are projecting stable incentives, but the regulator has stated that for future CapEx from 2016 onwards, they will be more selective. So that end of the plan mix 54% incentivized and 46% ordinary might be closer to a 50-50 kind of profile if the regulator decides that from next year we will have a different incentive mechanism. And we are open to discuss it with the regulator. And again, incentive is another of those parameters that are going into the allowed return. So I'm prepared to have less incentives, but maybe I would need to have more room on other parameters. So it's not a science, I think, it's more of an art.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Antonio Colombi (Executives)】\nThere, Monica Girardi.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Monica Girardi (Analysts)】\nMonica Girardi, Barclays. I have a few question. One goes back to the regulation and the dividend policy. I appreciate you are in the middle of a reregulation, so you may not be super explicit on that, but I will try to take out something. On the -- assuming that the regulator does not give to you a return that you consider to be satisfactory for whatever reason, do you have some flexibility in your CapEx to protect free cash flows and to grant a satisfactory return to shareholder anyway, i.e., what are your priorities in terms of between CapEx and dividends? The second question is on the international strategy. Last year, there was a great focus on the Greek privatization, which seems to be a bit of off the table for obvious reasons. I was wondering if you can just give us an update on what Terna maybe in the medium to long run might aspire to be in Europe? And last one on the refinancing, just a super quick question. Can you give us the assumption that you have in your plan in terms of maturity of lines that you are refinancing going forward, if you want to keep the 5.5 years tenor or if you are willing to go on a shorter maturity?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matteo del Fante (Executives)】\nOkay. Starting with the first question is, I think, we are being relatively explicit today. Pending the regulatory review, we consider EUR 0.20 a solid basis for future dividend. So we think we have a business model and we have gone into details of our cash flow generation metrics that should make the market feel comfortable. In terms of Greece, one year ago, we had on the table a 700-ish million potential equity investment in Greece and there was the transaction that Terna was focusing on. In the meantime, we -- Greece has gone at the moment out of our agenda. But we have deployed time and resources and focus and potentially capital to the domestic grid extension initiative with Ferrovie dello Stato, with the national railway. So it's not a totally closed chapter, but now we are clearly giving a priority to the national railway transaction. And on the average maturity assumptions, I'll ask the CFO to support me.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pierpaolo Cristofori (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you, Matteo. No, we are happy with the tenor that we have today. You'll know that we have substantial money coming due in 2017. And if I look at these spreads that we can enjoy today, we could have a substantial advantage going forward. We're looking into the math there, it doesn't mean that we'll do something about that. As of today, we're happy with the strategy that we are putting in place.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Antonio Colombi (Executives)】\nAntonella Bianchessi from Citigroup.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Antonella Bianchessi (Analysts)】\nIt's Antonella from Citigroup. Just 3 question. The first one is on your credit metric. It seems to me that this plan is trying to optimize and to extract value from all the possibility that Terna has, but your credit metric are supposed to improve materially from 2017 onward. Do you think this is necessary? Or you think that the company should maintain a higher debt in order to reduce its cost of capital and given current market condition? The second question is that you will have regulatory framework that is set for the next 6 years, which probably will continue to allow the revision of your allowed return on a 2-year basis. How can you exploit the fact that you de facto-ed on type of huge bond risk exposure? You theoretically should shorten your debt and profit by this even if probably it's not the best things for the system in general but to play the regulatory game. The other question is on your new project. From the slide, it's not really clear if there is additional EBITDA compared to a 68 coming now because it looks like that the 50% margin is getting smaller and the other are bigger but the margin is lower. So if you can quantify the EBITDA of a new project, of a new initiative?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matteo del Fante (Executives)】\nOkay. Not easy questions. The key metrics, at this point, we feel that we have to keep it strong because we have to be ready to see what will come out from the regulatory framework. So I'm sorry, in a way, to say, but I would like to give an answer, a detailed answer to most of the questions I receive in January, but I don't have to answer it now, we don't have time to wait until January. But what I can do from now to the end of the year, I can commit to keep a strong balance sheet. And if I have a benign or a relatively positive results from the regulator, I could consider optimization. The second question is about the rolling 2 years, which is an interesting consideration.  We keep our -- we basically split the average life of our debt from the risk exposure, and we cover risk only over the course of the regulatory period. And we will certainly do it more on the 2-year basis than the usual 4-year because the resetting now is rolling every 2 years. EBITDA, we believe, in terms of annual, that in the plan, at the end of the plan specifically, the known traditional activities will generate EUR 20 million additional EBITDA. So the EBITDA will improve by EUR 20 million from the nontraditional and around EUR 30 million from OpEx, so we're putting at the EBITDA level a EUR 50 million cushion towards the regulatory review decision.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Antonio Colombi (Executives)】\nStefano Gamberini.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stefano Gamberini (Analysts)】\nStefano Gamberini, Equita SIM, 3 questions, if I may. First of all, regarding your CapEx, the Slide 22, if you can just give us an idea for what are the main projects you have inside the EUR 3.2 billion of investments? And also are you confident that all the investments could be realized in the period? And may I refer to the interconnection with Montenegro, how the project is going? The second, regarding the nontraditional, more or less it's the same question regarding the interconnection with France. So if I'm not wrong, you start to add the revenues from 2016, and so if you can update how are going the negotiations with the main investors in the project. The last one is regarding the acquisition of the railway network. You said that you have very strict financial criteria, so could you share with us what are these criteria? And my main question is, the RAB could be a ceiling of an acquisition of an offer that you can do because in this case we are speaking around a negotiation just between 2 parts, and probably to be clear, what is your target?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matteo del Fante (Executives)】\nOkay. I will answer the second question if you allow me and then ask. The RAB of the railway network will be the starting point for our consideration on price together with the allowed return. What we have stated clearly is that we aim to obtain returns on the new investment that are comparable with the returns that our investor base is enjoying and benefiting in the current business plan. And that's clearly a positive outcome for us and that's what we are targeting. But at the end, there will be a minor negotiation process that eventually will take place and you have to trust us that we will do the best. At the end of the day, we have only 1 little advantage over the -- that we are the only listed player in this negotiation. And so we have to respect the interest of many investors, private and institutional, that are expecting our board and our company to create value for their share. On the second question, I will ask Gianni Armani, the CEO of Terna Rete Italia, to answer. The first question is the major projects and the second one is Montenegro/France.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Gianni Armani (Executives)】\nThank you very much, Matteo. And first of all, on CapEx plan, more or less EUR 1 billion is -- of the EUR 3.2 billion is concentrated on interconnections, so Montenegro and France. Both of the lines will be in operations between 2018 and 2019, plus Montenegro is currently progressing. We laid down more or less 140 kilometers of sea cables, and the operations are going ahead both in Montenegro and in Italy. On the Italy-France interconnection, instead, we have awarded today to Prysmian the cable contract together with LTE, of course. And we are progressing also on the interconnector part of the link, that is the private line project for which we have the full mandate from the financer, both on asking the exemption, that is the right for extracting revenues from the line, and for operating on the financing part for all the project. And by the end of the year, we will have a news on this project.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Antonio Colombi (Executives)】\nAnna Maria Scaglia from Morgan Stanley.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Anna Maria Scaglia (Analysts)】\nIt's Anna Maria Scaglia from Morgan Stanley. Four questions, if I may. The first one is regarding your cash position in your balance sheet. So you keep having quite a lot of cash. So far, you have been able to get quite good returns, but I'm wondering what's your expectations during the plan? Are you thinking about reducing it? What's the rationale for keeping it? Or is there waiting for the FS grid acquisition? The second question is on regulation. We are not just waiting for the electricity regulation but also the allowed return regulation. Do you have any timeline for that? Any expectations when the document on the allowed return could be out? Third, you mentioned nonrecurring items in your revenue lines. I was wondering if you can clarify those? And last but not least, my impression is that with the acquisition of the FS grid, you could have CapEx savings in your plan. So I'm -- because the 2 lines going parallel, so I'm wondering whether your plan could change once you acquire the grid from FS?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matteo del Fante (Executives)】\nSo I will take the last one, but maybe first, Pierpaolo, you want to answer the first and the second.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pierpaolo Cristofori (Executives)】\nYes, on the cash position, as I said, year-end, we were at EUR 1.2 billion on top of an availability of additional EUR 700 million. And of course, we are trying to reduce our cash at minimum reasonabl because today, clearly, we don't enjoy any longer the investment rates that we used to enjoy in the past. So we decided to have available lines other than cash lines. If you look at and compare it year-on-year, we have already substantially reduced vis-à-vis last year. And in fact, we were able to decrease gross indebted vis-à-vis last year by EUR 100 million. So the amount of cash that we're willing to take on our books is the minimum that is needed in order to retain our rating figures at this point in time. So I don't want excess cash sitting on my books being idle. On the other end, in order to fuel whatever is necessary to do for either for this [ph] or additional opportunities that may materialize, rather than looking at cash, we would look at our ability to raise debt. We will -- we are already in the process of increasing our E&P program by an additional EUR 2 billion, which will come in a few weeks. So that would be allowing us to have in our formulation to support Matteo in the development plans that we'll have on the business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matteo del Fante (Executives)】\nAnd in terms of reviewing the CapEx plan, that was the last question, Anna Maria, on the back of the potential railway transaction, I think, it's a very fair question. And the answer is more or less, yes, in the sense that the optimization of the combined grids, we require the review of some of the projects we have in the EUR 3.2 billion, of some of the projects that we have in the 6.7. But it will have to be done after due diligence. So it's something that is very hard to do [indiscernible]. We will have to look side-by-side. I mean, Ferrovie is, from an operational standpoint, a very significant transaction, 9,000. And it might be that the RAB will be allowed for a smaller amount than 9,000, I don't know. But 9,000 kilometers over 63,000 is 15% of our size. So integrating 15% new grid in an existing grid is very important and very articulate operational exercise that will require a lot of focus and care, and that, at the end of the day, will have an impact also on the overall grid efficiency in the system because grids work better when they have more potential lines of contact and 15% increase of the current, if you think that in 2014 we have created only \"EUR 300 million,\" clearly very focused on solving bottlenecks. But EUR 300 million and the one shot we are acquiring 9,000 admits that it's significant. And therefore, I believe that the answer is, yes, but it's a yes that requires work \r\n[Audio Gap]\r\nis that our lines and the Ferrovie lines are taking on the ground. And as you know, in many places, given these grids have been put in place when there was less presence of industries or housing, these are important areas where you can have new infrastructures or new developments if you don't need the grid any longer.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pierpaolo Cristofori (Executives)】\nThere was the last question, I guess, on 2014 numbers about the nonrecurring items. We're talking approximately EUR 8 million as a combination of 2 effects. One is we had less surpluses as opposed to last year, so half and half. And on the other hand, we have a release in some provisions that we did in the last years, I would say, and concerning in particular our prototype projects because we had some provisions to care for some risks that didn't materialize. So the sum of the 2 is a positive EUR 8 million. The rest of that is, as I said, additional EPC and OEM revenues. And the rest is basically the same in term of TLC revenues that we extract from our hosting contract.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Antonio Colombi (Executives)】\nThere.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stefano Bezzato (Analysts)】\nStefano Bezzato, Crédit Suisse. Three questions, please. The first one on the abolition of the Robin Hood Tax, whether you see the risk of any other measure replacing it or negatively affecting Terna's profitability? And if that's not the case, would you be able to share with us the guidance for 2015 net income? The second question, on the 2014 results, if you can provide or disclose the recurring net income for 2014? And the last question on deferred taxes, the adjustment that you mentioned on your press release for 2014, if you can quantify that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matteo del Fante (Executives)】\nOkay. You got the second and the third? If you can repeat them, apologies, the second and the third question again, sorry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Stefano Bezzato (Analysts)】\nOkay. The second question was on the 2014 results, if you can provide a recurring net income number? And the third question was on the deferred taxes. You mentioned on the press release that there is an adjustment on deferred taxes because of the Robin Hood Tax abolition, if you can quantify that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matteo del Fante (Executives)】\nYes, you gave me the third and the first, but I remember now the second one, which was actually, if we can give you guidance for 2015 net income. Let's start with that one. We haven't put it on the screen because we think it's a bit premature. What I can tell you is that we would committing to a EUR 0.20 dividend. We would be in the region of 70% payout, which ranks both in absolute terms, and I would add, on a relative basis, with other peers in Italy and abroad in the regulator space, will look very solid. The first question on the abolition of the Robin Hood Tax, we have no anticipation. We haven't seen any declaration by officials that this will be replaced. In a way, Terna only has paid in excess of EUR 300 million of additional taxes since the Robin Hood Tax was put in place and up to the date of the ruling. So one could say that the measure has created the extra revenues for the state in the middle of probably an overall difficult balance sheet and economic scenario for public finances. And maybe that scenario is now not so difficult. But it's really above us to make any forecast. And the question on recurrent net income number for 2014.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pierpaolo Cristofori (Executives)】\nYes. Speaking on the answer that I gave before, on the revenue side, taking away quality for a second, if I take away quality both on the cost and the revenue side, basically, we are compensating a positive and negative vis-à-vis last year, because as I said, we benefited in revenues for approximately net EUR 8 million. And on top of that, on the -- while on the negative we had this year, we didn't have the benefit and we will not have the benefit going forward of some remuneration that we got in the prior years for the reduction of volumes in the dispatching market. If you take into account the extraordinary accrual of EUR 37 million, so bottom line, we basically funded that difference through the additional revenues that we got in quality. So exactly the last sentence they had on my slide. So this year, we had very strong quality. Does it happen every year? We don't know, because partially, it depends on us, partially, it doesn't. But this year, we used a fair amount of money that we were able to extract from the management of the network in order to fund that additional provision that we took on our books. All in all, the other things substantially compensate each other because we had something surplus, but we had accrued something else. And on top of that, on the negative side, we also did some additional provision from IMU, which is a lot of tax in Italy according to some degree that came along with the new tax at year-end. Would it materialize or not, we have something there. So bottom line, it wouldn't be any different, if anything, probably would be slightly better than anticipated.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Antonio Colombi (Executives)】\nMaurice Choy from Royal Bank of Canada.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Maurice Choy (Analysts)】\nThis is Maurice Choy from RBC Capital Markets. Two questions. First question is on dividend, second question is on CapEx. The first question, dividends, I remember last year the policy was EUR 0.19 plus 6% of payout for the nontraditional activities. And this year, that's changed to EUR 0.20 guidance. Can I just get a little understand of how you got to the change in your train of thought on dividends? That's the first question. And the second question on CapEx, Slide 20 shows you the CapEx for every single year. And I do notice that a little bit of a decrease from '15 all the way to '18 and a little bit of uptick into 2019. So I just wanted to understand what's driving that up? And should we consider that that should be continue rising up?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matteo del Fante (Executives)】\nOn the dividend, it's very straightforward, we just wanted to make it easier. There was no specific material reason to put a weight, any \"risk\" on this very small portion of the dividend, the nontraditional. We will review after the regulatory ruling. Potentially, we can go back if we see the reason and we see -- but it's not something that we attach a lot of relevance. In terms of the CapEx, the answer is no. You have a blimp in 2019 for a very specific project that has a lump sum payment that we expect in 2019. But net of that project, we will expect CapEx to stabilize with decreasing trend in the EUR 500 million to EUR 400 million per annum.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Antonio Colombi (Executives)】\nSo seems no more questions. So thank you very much, and we'll see the first quarter results. Thank you very much.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Matteo del Fante (Executives)】\nThank you.",

      "transcript_text1": "Good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our Year-End 2014 Results Conference Call. In this call, our CEO, Burak Basarir, will briefly talk about our operations in 2014; then our CFO, Orhun Köstem, will share with you the financial review of the year. Following Burak's closing remarks, we will start the Q&A session.\r\nBefore we begin, please kindly be advised of our cautionary statement. This conference call may contain forward-looking management comments, including projections, and these should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary language contained in this earnings release. A copy of the release and financials are available on our website at cci.com.tr.\r\nNow let me turn the call over to Burak.\n\n---\n\nWell, thank you, Deniz. Good afternoon, everyone. As you know, 2014 was a very challenging year for the beverage business, both in Turkey and international operations. Despite tough headwinds, CCI delivered 7% consolidated volume growth and double-digit revenue growth.\r\nIn 2014, transactions grew ahead of the volume growth in Turkey. In line with our long-term strategy, transitions towards immediate consumption packages in the sparkling category continued in Turkey. Accordingly, transaction figures for IC packages continue to increase, which creates opportunity by new recruitment and supports profitability of the category in the long run.\r\nCCI delivered very strong performance in international operations as well, despite the macro and geopolitical situations in key markets, including recent devaluations in Central Asia and declining oil prices, political instability in Pakistan and Iraq.\r\nIn 2014, international operations showed double-digit top line growth and a marginal EBITDA margin increase. CCI generated positive free cash flow in 2014 despite the high CapEx additions, especially in international operations.\r\nNow let me turn into our contribution to growth for the past year. Turkey sales volume increased by 1%, adding 4 million unit cases; and international operations delivered 14% growth, adding 69 million unit cases to our top line volume numbers. Year-to-date total volume growth was almost in the 3 million cases, resulting in 7% over a strong 13% growth of last year.\r\nInternational sales volume now account about 49% of our total volume compared to 46% a year ago. International sales contribution is led by Pakistan at 21%; Iraq 9%; and Kazakhstan 9% of our total consolidated volume.\r\nHow did we do on the category side in 2014? We grew across all beverage categories, which is a great news. Sparkling is 71% of our total volume mix, and the category posted 5% growth, driven by our 3 core brands: Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Zero, Fanta, Sprite and particularly in the international operations.\r\nStill, excluding water, grew by 16%, led by mainly juice and iced tea categories. Water, on the other hand, grew by 11% in the same period. As still beverages' portfolio growth was higher than sparkling in the last year, the share of the stills category in the total mix was slightly down.\r\nNow let's briefly review Turkey operations. Overall, Turkey volume growth slowed down as the sparkling category contracted 5%, while still category posted double-digit growth, driven mainly by juice and iced tea segments. The shift of sales mix towards immediate consumption packages continued in all categories, creating recruitment opportunities in our Turkish franchise.\r\nIn 2014, the construction in -- contraction in future consumption packages adversely impacted sparkling category expansion, and hence, weighed on the volume growth in Turkey.\r\nOn the other hand, total transaction numbers in sparkling categories were almost flat due to strong iced tea performance, despite the contraction of the category. In line with our strategy to address health and wellness trends, sugar-free segment continued its strong growth.\r\nCoca-Cola Zero grew almost 50%. The new product launch of Coca-Cola Zero PET 2.5-liter in the first quarter surpassed Zero PET 1.5-liter in the third quarter, so far with the strong growth.\r\nWhile sugar-free segment makes only 3% of our total sparkling volume, we believe there's a substantial opportunity for sugar-free segment growth going forward. \r\nStill beverages, excluding water, grew at high teens in 2014 on the back of double-digit growth both in iced tea and juice categories. Cappy brand maintained its strong momentum, with all subcategories posting over 10% overall growth.\r\nFuse Tea delivered over 50% volume growth, supported by successful IC pack introductions, such as can 250ml and 500ml packages and new peach sugar-free flavor expansion.\r\nThe water category grew at 5% in 2014 despite the contraction in Home and Office Delivery segment, as the focus on profitable growth of water category to iced tea packages in the total portfolio continue to increase.\r\nThe non-ready-to-drink tea category grew by 12% in 2014. As you know, we only do sales and distribution of our Dogadan brand.\r\nIn 2014, while average price increases was only 4% in Turkey, the fourth quarter average price increased by 16%, thanks to the increase of the high-selling, large-factor [indiscernible] effective from October '14, as well as the favorable package mix.\r\nWe are starting 2015 with a better price base in Turkey, which will support margins, given the stable outlook in raw material prices, but of course, the currency fluctuations will always be on our radar screen.\r\nNow let's move into international operations. In line with our guidance, international operations delivered mid-teens growth in 2014, with substantial market share gains below our median markets.\r\nPakistan posted 17% volume growth in 2014 despite the devastating floods, political unrest in the high season. In 2014, Pakistan's growth rate was in line with last 5 years' average growth. We led industry growth with a market share increase from 31% in 2013 to 35% in '14.\r\nNow let me throw down the line that the Coca-Cola brand is that #1 cola brand in Pakistan. Successful campaigns such as returnable glass bottle 250ml under-the-cap promotion, surprise promotion Fanta flavor launch and the Ramadan campaign supported the strong volume growth in Pakistan.\r\nCentral Asia posted 16% volume growth. Kazakhstan, the largest market in the region, delivered 19% volume growth in 2014, supported by market share gains in the sparkling category. Our market share gain in the sparkling category increased from 48% in 2013 to 49% in 2014. Both sparkling and iced tea categories posted double-digit volume growth in Kazakhstan, in spite of sharp devaluation in February and unfavorable weather conditions in Kazakhstan.\r\nSuccessful Nowruz, FIFA World Cup and Fanta Youth Festival campaigns supported the volume growth across the Central Asia.\r\nMiddle East posted 7% volume growth in '14. On the back of the security situation in Iraq, as we all know, Iraq volume grew by 6%, with strong organic growth in South, compensating for the contraction in the northern part of the country.\r\nSparkling category market share in Iraq increased from 22% in 2013 to 29% on the back of continuous improvement in our Iraq market, the market execution and successful marketing campaigns.\r\nIn addition with our plants, we brought production records in high season in almost every geography we operate in, in the international operations. And our new facilities in Multan, Pakistan; Astana, Kazakhstan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan are planned to be operational in the second quarter.\r\nNow I would like to turn the call over to Orhun for an update on the financials.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Burak. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I move on to and talk about the numbers, let me briefly give, as always, a backdrop of the financial information. Coca-Cola Icecek reports in Turkish liras. Our international operations and functional reporting currencies are U.S. dollar, except for Pakistan, where the functional currency is rupee and reporting currency is dollars. So therefore, it is quite important we understand the Turkish lira movement against, especially dollar, and the inflation prevailing at the time of the financial statement.\r\nThe annual inflation in 2014 was 8.2%. And if you look at the average dollar tier rate, it has moved about 8.6% -- sorry, 14.9%, and year-on-year FX rate has moved about 8.6%. So quite a bit of volatility on that front.\r\nAnd if you move over to talk about the financial performance that's on Slide 11, I will not necessarily go through the volume performance. Burak has given a thorough analysis of the commercial performance, basically, other than saying on volume trends, we're pretty much in line with our original guidance, which was high-single digit. But obviously, the constituents or the contribution to that performance has been different between -- among different geographies.\r\nIn Turkey, first of all, we've seen a net revenue growth of about 5% in 2014. And as you remember in our earlier discussions, the revenue growth for most parts of the year was slow in Turkey and primarily driven by mix effect, rather than price increases. And such increases are implemented in the last quarter of the year, so therefore, on a per-unit-case basis, you've seen the last quarter prices in Turkey coming up just under 16%, as we had described in our last call, basically.\r\nOn the international side, on dollar basis, the revenues were up by, again, just under 12%. The average prices throughout 2014 was 2% less than 2013, mainly by 2 reasons, one of them is obviously the devaluation that we've seen in Kazakhstan, the 19% devaluation of tenge was actually quite visible in the revenue line. But otherwise, the markets where we have relatively lower net revenue per case, which is obviously, Iraq and Pakistan, continue to have a higher share in the overall mix.\r\nIf we move on to the other page, which is 12, to talk about the profitability. Obviously, as we discussed, we've seen quite a favorable year in terms of raw material pricing in 2014.\r\nIn Turkey, the resin prices were down, of course, in mid-teens; aluminum prices were down, can prices were down in the low-single digit. The only raw material item which had a price increase was sugar. And as you remember, the prices of sugar in Turkey increased by about 10% in June.\r\nHowever, the gross profit margin in Turkey actually contracted by just over 200 basis points and was realized at 39.8% in 2014 for 2 reasons, obviously: one, a slow revenue per-case growth throughout 2014; and then the impact of currency volatility, that was instrumental in Turkey's overall cost base.\r\nIf you look at the international operations, the cost of sales was more or less -- the growth in cost of sales was about 11.4%, which was more or less in line with the net sales growth. And our gross profit margin was up by 20 basis points to 32.80%.\r\nSimilar to Turkey, we have seen a quite favorable raw material environment. And of course, unlike Turkey, we have seen favorable prices for sugar as well in many of our markets, usually to the tune of high single to low double digits in 2014. So on a consolidated basis, our gross margin contracted to 36.4%. That's, again, primarily driven by the gross margin contraction of the Turkish business.\r\nIf you look at the operating expenses, the operating expenses in Turkey increased by about 4%. If you look at 2014 in general, in international operations, our OpEx per unit case was flat. So from this angle, actually, less contribution toward potential profit leak at the OpEx level. Having said that, of course, our EBIT and EBITDA numbers, obviously, reflecting the impact of the gross margin contraction.\r\nIn Turkey, EBIT was down by 16%, with about 200 basis points contraction of EBIT margin to about 80%. And EBITDA margin was down just under 300 basis points or about 12%.\r\nOn the international side, our EBIT was up by 11%. EBIT margin was flat, about 12.7%, 12.8% levels. And then EBITDA, again, increased by about 12%, and our EBITDA margin remained flat. So all in all, if you look at on a consolidated basis, we've seen an EBITDA margin contraction of about 110 basis points.\r\nNow if you look -- go back and compare to our initial guidance for 2014, you'd remember, we first expected a flat EBITDA margin and revised it to a contraction under 150 basis points. Basically, what has taken place is that we have looked -- we've seen quite a, I think, important achievement on the international front, given that the things that has been taking place from devaluation in Kazakhstan and war breaking out in Iraq and floods and political volatility in Pakistan, these are our largest markets of operation outside of Turkey, we have been able to maintain the profitability together with the growth of the business.\r\nObviously, the original plan potentially was to expand the margins across international territories, but given the backdrop in 2014, we believe we delivered successfully in those markets. And Turkey, again, given the pricing policy that we described to you a year ago, we were expecting the margin contractions, so therefore, at the end of the year, we've seen a margin contraction in line or a bit better than our margin revision that we presented to you back in November.\r\nNow if you look at the financial expenses and break it down, that's on Page 13, our interest income is almost flat, although our interest expense has increased by about TRY 50 million. That's obviously a function of us refinancing the debt on our balance sheet, which was basic in 2013, which was basically bank debt with a short-term maturity of 1.5 years on average, with a longer-term debt instruments, such as the Eurobond and product placement, which brought our average maturity at the end of 2014 to under -- just under 4 years, 3.6 years, but of course, bears to highest interest expense.\r\nThe FX loss, unrealized FX loss in 2014 was half of that in 2013 at TRY 149 million. So overall, if you look at the net-net financial expenses from TRY 257 million a year ago, it came down to TRY 194 million -- minus TRY 194 million in 2014.\r\nAgain, together with the EBIT performance and together with the financial income in the FX, and the FX loss has come down to TRY 93 million from about TRY 200 million to TRY 203 million. And in 2013, we saw our net income increasing by 28% to TRY 315 million in 2014.\r\nNow the source of those financial expenses, if you go on to the next slide, which is 14, I've mentioned that, actually, on gross terms, has declined to TRY 1,140,000,000. But at the same time, our cash has also declined in the same period. And if you look at our net financial debt, our net financial debt has moved from $750 million to about $812 million at the end of 2014.\r\nYou would remember, end of 2013, there is still cash that we're carrying and debt that we're carrying in our balance sheet, that lead then into 2014, met the bank that we had closed down with the proceeds we received from Eurobond and private placement. So both a decrease of -- debt and decrease of cash are due to that -- possibly due to that movement as well. The majority of our debt is in foreign currency. Obviously, 86% is in dollars. Some -- about 13% is Pakistan rupees, basically. And as we discussed, it has a duration of about 3.6 years.\r\nAnd the last part of our debt is now maturing in 2018. Our net debt has moved from 1.8x to just under 2x, 1.96x at the end of 2014, still at just under the level we want to maintain, which is about -- or at the level that we might maintain our net debt-to-EBITDA result, which, as you know, is about 2x in general.\r\nAnd if you move to the cash flow performance, we believe one area which we have been able to manage quite successfully is the components of the cash flow. If you look at our net operating cash -- cash flow generated from our operating activities has increased by about 13% in 2014. Now that's a function of also our management of our net working capital, where we're reducing net working capital as a percentage of revenues from 13% a year ago to 11.3% in 2014.\r\nAnd for those of you who have been following CCI, you remember that figure was 14% to 15% levels 4 to 5 years ago, so we continue to take steps in that area as well.\r\nIf you look at the CapEx performance, our CapEx, well, on a TL basis, only up by about TRY 34 million. And as a percent of revenue, again, has remained about 11%, 12%. That's usually the target that we love to talk about. And I think in 2015 as well, the level will not be necessary be very different of around 12% of revenue levels. And as a result, our free cash flow had almost TRY 50 million, went from a base of minus TRY 44 million in 2013 to TRY 10 million at the end of 2014, basically.\r\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Burak to share the outlook for this year and the guidance, overall.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Orhun. Well, 2015 looks like it's going to be another exciting year, so we expect Turkey volume to grow at low single digits in Turkey, while we expect international operations to grow at low teens, and consequently, the consolidated volume to grow at high single digits.\r\nWe expect, as usual, net sales revenue growth to be ahead of volume growth, and EBITDA growth to be ahead of our revenue growth.\r\nThe declining share of large packs within total portfolio will continue to weigh on total volume growth in Turkey. However, as the number of transactions increase on the back of IC growth, our sales mix will evolve with a healthier, profitable and more sustainable base.\r\nDespite the economic challenges in Central Asia, we plan to increase our prices to mitigate the effect of currency devaluations, while taking affordability into account, obviously.\r\nIn 2015, we expect to benefit from declining raw material prices as well, as Orhun has also talked about.\r\nSo how are we going to deliver these commitments? Our near-term strategy is well in place, which is basically, we will be focusing on main strategic imperatives. One, our goal is to accelerate our revenue and margin growth, obviously, in all of the markets we operate in. Two, capture the great opportunity in our geography through growing sparkling category and the per caps. So we all know about the opportunities in 10 of the geographies we operate in.\r\nThree, be mindful on the stills category, while selectively expanding the category profitably is a must. And we will enable these 3 commercial imperatives through always winning at point-of-sale through effective sales force and by effective revenue growth management by new OBPPC initiatives. And four, continue enhancing our reputation in every geography we operate in. And also, lastly, keeping us in our most important asset, which is our people.\r\nSo thank you. Now I think we can open the floor for Q&A.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Deniz Can Yücel (Executives)】\nGood morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our Year-End 2014 Results Conference Call. In this call, our CEO, Burak Basarir, will briefly talk about our operations in 2014; then our CFO, Orhun Köstem, will share with you the financial review of the year. Following Burak's closing remarks, we will start the Q&A session.\r\nBefore we begin, please kindly be advised of our cautionary statement. This conference call may contain forward-looking management comments, including projections, and these should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary language contained in this earnings release. A copy of the release and financials are available on our website at cci.com.tr.\r\nNow let me turn the call over to Burak.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Burak Basarir (Executives)】\nWell, thank you, Deniz. Good afternoon, everyone. As you know, 2014 was a very challenging year for the beverage business, both in Turkey and international operations. Despite tough headwinds, CCI delivered 7% consolidated volume growth and double-digit revenue growth.\r\nIn 2014, transactions grew ahead of the volume growth in Turkey. In line with our long-term strategy, transitions towards immediate consumption packages in the sparkling category continued in Turkey. Accordingly, transaction figures for IC packages continue to increase, which creates opportunity by new recruitment and supports profitability of the category in the long run.\r\nCCI delivered very strong performance in international operations as well, despite the macro and geopolitical situations in key markets, including recent devaluations in Central Asia and declining oil prices, political instability in Pakistan and Iraq.\r\nIn 2014, international operations showed double-digit top line growth and a marginal EBITDA margin increase. CCI generated positive free cash flow in 2014 despite the high CapEx additions, especially in international operations.\r\nNow let me turn into our contribution to growth for the past year. Turkey sales volume increased by 1%, adding 4 million unit cases; and international operations delivered 14% growth, adding 69 million unit cases to our top line volume numbers. Year-to-date total volume growth was almost in the 3 million cases, resulting in 7% over a strong 13% growth of last year.\r\nInternational sales volume now account about 49% of our total volume compared to 46% a year ago. International sales contribution is led by Pakistan at 21%; Iraq 9%; and Kazakhstan 9% of our total consolidated volume.\r\nHow did we do on the category side in 2014? We grew across all beverage categories, which is a great news. Sparkling is 71% of our total volume mix, and the category posted 5% growth, driven by our 3 core brands: Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Zero, Fanta, Sprite and particularly in the international operations.\r\nStill, excluding water, grew by 16%, led by mainly juice and iced tea categories. Water, on the other hand, grew by 11% in the same period. As still beverages' portfolio growth was higher than sparkling in the last year, the share of the stills category in the total mix was slightly down.\r\nNow let's briefly review Turkey operations. Overall, Turkey volume growth slowed down as the sparkling category contracted 5%, while still category posted double-digit growth, driven mainly by juice and iced tea segments. The shift of sales mix towards immediate consumption packages continued in all categories, creating recruitment opportunities in our Turkish franchise.\r\nIn 2014, the construction in -- contraction in future consumption packages adversely impacted sparkling category expansion, and hence, weighed on the volume growth in Turkey.\r\nOn the other hand, total transaction numbers in sparkling categories were almost flat due to strong iced tea performance, despite the contraction of the category. In line with our strategy to address health and wellness trends, sugar-free segment continued its strong growth.\r\nCoca-Cola Zero grew almost 50%. The new product launch of Coca-Cola Zero PET 2.5-liter in the first quarter surpassed Zero PET 1.5-liter in the third quarter, so far with the strong growth.\r\nWhile sugar-free segment makes only 3% of our total sparkling volume, we believe there's a substantial opportunity for sugar-free segment growth going forward. \r\nStill beverages, excluding water, grew at high teens in 2014 on the back of double-digit growth both in iced tea and juice categories. Cappy brand maintained its strong momentum, with all subcategories posting over 10% overall growth.\r\nFuse Tea delivered over 50% volume growth, supported by successful IC pack introductions, such as can 250ml and 500ml packages and new peach sugar-free flavor expansion.\r\nThe water category grew at 5% in 2014 despite the contraction in Home and Office Delivery segment, as the focus on profitable growth of water category to iced tea packages in the total portfolio continue to increase.\r\nThe non-ready-to-drink tea category grew by 12% in 2014. As you know, we only do sales and distribution of our Dogadan brand.\r\nIn 2014, while average price increases was only 4% in Turkey, the fourth quarter average price increased by 16%, thanks to the increase of the high-selling, large-factor [indiscernible] effective from October '14, as well as the favorable package mix.\r\nWe are starting 2015 with a better price base in Turkey, which will support margins, given the stable outlook in raw material prices, but of course, the currency fluctuations will always be on our radar screen.\r\nNow let's move into international operations. In line with our guidance, international operations delivered mid-teens growth in 2014, with substantial market share gains below our median markets.\r\nPakistan posted 17% volume growth in 2014 despite the devastating floods, political unrest in the high season. In 2014, Pakistan's growth rate was in line with last 5 years' average growth. We led industry growth with a market share increase from 31% in 2013 to 35% in '14.\r\nNow let me throw down the line that the Coca-Cola brand is that #1 cola brand in Pakistan. Successful campaigns such as returnable glass bottle 250ml under-the-cap promotion, surprise promotion Fanta flavor launch and the Ramadan campaign supported the strong volume growth in Pakistan.\r\nCentral Asia posted 16% volume growth. Kazakhstan, the largest market in the region, delivered 19% volume growth in 2014, supported by market share gains in the sparkling category. Our market share gain in the sparkling category increased from 48% in 2013 to 49% in 2014. Both sparkling and iced tea categories posted double-digit volume growth in Kazakhstan, in spite of sharp devaluation in February and unfavorable weather conditions in Kazakhstan.\r\nSuccessful Nowruz, FIFA World Cup and Fanta Youth Festival campaigns supported the volume growth across the Central Asia.\r\nMiddle East posted 7% volume growth in '14. On the back of the security situation in Iraq, as we all know, Iraq volume grew by 6%, with strong organic growth in South, compensating for the contraction in the northern part of the country.\r\nSparkling category market share in Iraq increased from 22% in 2013 to 29% on the back of continuous improvement in our Iraq market, the market execution and successful marketing campaigns.\r\nIn addition with our plants, we brought production records in high season in almost every geography we operate in, in the international operations. And our new facilities in Multan, Pakistan; Astana, Kazakhstan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan are planned to be operational in the second quarter.\r\nNow I would like to turn the call over to Orhun for an update on the financials.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Nusret Köstem (Executives)】\nThank you, Burak. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I move on to and talk about the numbers, let me briefly give, as always, a backdrop of the financial information. Coca-Cola Icecek reports in Turkish liras. Our international operations and functional reporting currencies are U.S. dollar, except for Pakistan, where the functional currency is rupee and reporting currency is dollars. So therefore, it is quite important we understand the Turkish lira movement against, especially dollar, and the inflation prevailing at the time of the financial statement.\r\nThe annual inflation in 2014 was 8.2%. And if you look at the average dollar tier rate, it has moved about 8.6% -- sorry, 14.9%, and year-on-year FX rate has moved about 8.6%. So quite a bit of volatility on that front.\r\nAnd if you move over to talk about the financial performance that's on Slide 11, I will not necessarily go through the volume performance. Burak has given a thorough analysis of the commercial performance, basically, other than saying on volume trends, we're pretty much in line with our original guidance, which was high-single digit. But obviously, the constituents or the contribution to that performance has been different between -- among different geographies.\r\nIn Turkey, first of all, we've seen a net revenue growth of about 5% in 2014. And as you remember in our earlier discussions, the revenue growth for most parts of the year was slow in Turkey and primarily driven by mix effect, rather than price increases. And such increases are implemented in the last quarter of the year, so therefore, on a per-unit-case basis, you've seen the last quarter prices in Turkey coming up just under 16%, as we had described in our last call, basically.\r\nOn the international side, on dollar basis, the revenues were up by, again, just under 12%. The average prices throughout 2014 was 2% less than 2013, mainly by 2 reasons, one of them is obviously the devaluation that we've seen in Kazakhstan, the 19% devaluation of tenge was actually quite visible in the revenue line. But otherwise, the markets where we have relatively lower net revenue per case, which is obviously, Iraq and Pakistan, continue to have a higher share in the overall mix.\r\nIf we move on to the other page, which is 12, to talk about the profitability. Obviously, as we discussed, we've seen quite a favorable year in terms of raw material pricing in 2014.\r\nIn Turkey, the resin prices were down, of course, in mid-teens; aluminum prices were down, can prices were down in the low-single digit. The only raw material item which had a price increase was sugar. And as you remember, the prices of sugar in Turkey increased by about 10% in June.\r\nHowever, the gross profit margin in Turkey actually contracted by just over 200 basis points and was realized at 39.8% in 2014 for 2 reasons, obviously: one, a slow revenue per-case growth throughout 2014; and then the impact of currency volatility, that was instrumental in Turkey's overall cost base.\r\nIf you look at the international operations, the cost of sales was more or less -- the growth in cost of sales was about 11.4%, which was more or less in line with the net sales growth. And our gross profit margin was up by 20 basis points to 32.80%.\r\nSimilar to Turkey, we have seen a quite favorable raw material environment. And of course, unlike Turkey, we have seen favorable prices for sugar as well in many of our markets, usually to the tune of high single to low double digits in 2014. So on a consolidated basis, our gross margin contracted to 36.4%. That's, again, primarily driven by the gross margin contraction of the Turkish business.\r\nIf you look at the operating expenses, the operating expenses in Turkey increased by about 4%. If you look at 2014 in general, in international operations, our OpEx per unit case was flat. So from this angle, actually, less contribution toward potential profit leak at the OpEx level. Having said that, of course, our EBIT and EBITDA numbers, obviously, reflecting the impact of the gross margin contraction.\r\nIn Turkey, EBIT was down by 16%, with about 200 basis points contraction of EBIT margin to about 80%. And EBITDA margin was down just under 300 basis points or about 12%.\r\nOn the international side, our EBIT was up by 11%. EBIT margin was flat, about 12.7%, 12.8% levels. And then EBITDA, again, increased by about 12%, and our EBITDA margin remained flat. So all in all, if you look at on a consolidated basis, we've seen an EBITDA margin contraction of about 110 basis points.\r\nNow if you look -- go back and compare to our initial guidance for 2014, you'd remember, we first expected a flat EBITDA margin and revised it to a contraction under 150 basis points. Basically, what has taken place is that we have looked -- we've seen quite a, I think, important achievement on the international front, given that the things that has been taking place from devaluation in Kazakhstan and war breaking out in Iraq and floods and political volatility in Pakistan, these are our largest markets of operation outside of Turkey, we have been able to maintain the profitability together with the growth of the business.\r\nObviously, the original plan potentially was to expand the margins across international territories, but given the backdrop in 2014, we believe we delivered successfully in those markets. And Turkey, again, given the pricing policy that we described to you a year ago, we were expecting the margin contractions, so therefore, at the end of the year, we've seen a margin contraction in line or a bit better than our margin revision that we presented to you back in November.\r\nNow if you look at the financial expenses and break it down, that's on Page 13, our interest income is almost flat, although our interest expense has increased by about TRY 50 million. That's obviously a function of us refinancing the debt on our balance sheet, which was basic in 2013, which was basically bank debt with a short-term maturity of 1.5 years on average, with a longer-term debt instruments, such as the Eurobond and product placement, which brought our average maturity at the end of 2014 to under -- just under 4 years, 3.6 years, but of course, bears to highest interest expense.\r\nThe FX loss, unrealized FX loss in 2014 was half of that in 2013 at TRY 149 million. So overall, if you look at the net-net financial expenses from TRY 257 million a year ago, it came down to TRY 194 million -- minus TRY 194 million in 2014.\r\nAgain, together with the EBIT performance and together with the financial income in the FX, and the FX loss has come down to TRY 93 million from about TRY 200 million to TRY 203 million. And in 2013, we saw our net income increasing by 28% to TRY 315 million in 2014.\r\nNow the source of those financial expenses, if you go on to the next slide, which is 14, I've mentioned that, actually, on gross terms, has declined to TRY 1,140,000,000. But at the same time, our cash has also declined in the same period. And if you look at our net financial debt, our net financial debt has moved from $750 million to about $812 million at the end of 2014.\r\nYou would remember, end of 2013, there is still cash that we're carrying and debt that we're carrying in our balance sheet, that lead then into 2014, met the bank that we had closed down with the proceeds we received from Eurobond and private placement. So both a decrease of -- debt and decrease of cash are due to that -- possibly due to that movement as well. The majority of our debt is in foreign currency. Obviously, 86% is in dollars. Some -- about 13% is Pakistan rupees, basically. And as we discussed, it has a duration of about 3.6 years.\r\nAnd the last part of our debt is now maturing in 2018. Our net debt has moved from 1.8x to just under 2x, 1.96x at the end of 2014, still at just under the level we want to maintain, which is about -- or at the level that we might maintain our net debt-to-EBITDA result, which, as you know, is about 2x in general.\r\nAnd if you move to the cash flow performance, we believe one area which we have been able to manage quite successfully is the components of the cash flow. If you look at our net operating cash -- cash flow generated from our operating activities has increased by about 13% in 2014. Now that's a function of also our management of our net working capital, where we're reducing net working capital as a percentage of revenues from 13% a year ago to 11.3% in 2014.\r\nAnd for those of you who have been following CCI, you remember that figure was 14% to 15% levels 4 to 5 years ago, so we continue to take steps in that area as well.\r\nIf you look at the CapEx performance, our CapEx, well, on a TL basis, only up by about TRY 34 million. And as a percent of revenue, again, has remained about 11%, 12%. That's usually the target that we love to talk about. And I think in 2015 as well, the level will not be necessary be very different of around 12% of revenue levels. And as a result, our free cash flow had almost TRY 50 million, went from a base of minus TRY 44 million in 2013 to TRY 10 million at the end of 2014, basically.\r\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Burak to share the outlook for this year and the guidance, overall.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Burak Basarir (Executives)】\nThank you, Orhun. Well, 2015 looks like it's going to be another exciting year, so we expect Turkey volume to grow at low single digits in Turkey, while we expect international operations to grow at low teens, and consequently, the consolidated volume to grow at high single digits.\r\nWe expect, as usual, net sales revenue growth to be ahead of volume growth, and EBITDA growth to be ahead of our revenue growth.\r\nThe declining share of large packs within total portfolio will continue to weigh on total volume growth in Turkey. However, as the number of transactions increase on the back of IC growth, our sales mix will evolve with a healthier, profitable and more sustainable base.\r\nDespite the economic challenges in Central Asia, we plan to increase our prices to mitigate the effect of currency devaluations, while taking affordability into account, obviously.\r\nIn 2015, we expect to benefit from declining raw material prices as well, as Orhun has also talked about.\r\nSo how are we going to deliver these commitments? Our near-term strategy is well in place, which is basically, we will be focusing on main strategic imperatives. One, our goal is to accelerate our revenue and margin growth, obviously, in all of the markets we operate in. Two, capture the great opportunity in our geography through growing sparkling category and the per caps. So we all know about the opportunities in 10 of the geographies we operate in.\r\nThree, be mindful on the stills category, while selectively expanding the category profitably is a must.

And four, continue enhancing our reputation in every geography we operate in. And also, lastly, keeping us in our most important asset, which is our people.\r\nSo thank you. Now I think we can open the floor for Q&A.",
      "transcript_text3": "This is Bayina Bashtaeva from Barclays. Just a few questions. First of all, I'm curious, what's your view on the Turkish consumer demand for this year? It just looks like your qualitative guidance for this year for Turkish volume is pretty much the same as you guided for 2014, even though it's more expected that the consumer demand should improve in Turkey this year. That's the first question. And second question, what is your EBITDA margin outlook for this year? I couldn't find it in your notes. And finally, on CapEx. What kind of number into the CapEx we should expect this year? And where would you spend it?\n\n---\n\nBayina, I'd like to answer your first part of your first question, actually, and then leave the last 2 to Orhun to take it on. Consumer demand in Turkey is a million-dollar question, I think. So we will be having a general election this year. Usually, the pattern we see is then a consumer's sentiment to improve, which will reflect positive on our volume numbers. But I would like to remind you, we did -- in fact, in Q1 last year, we had a very strong quarter. We grew 7% last year. So this year, Q1 is going to be a challenging quarter for us. So we're going to be factoring a very strong quarter. Looking at it from our side right now, I don't see any major deterioration in the consumer demand. But on the other hand, I'm not seeing any major uplift on the consumer demand either. So you'll kind of expect a flattish in terms of consumer demand. But again, in last year's performance, especially in the high season, we had some negative surprises. So taking that, reminding that to ourselves, we should be growing our business about 2% to 3% in Turkey in 2015.\n\n---\n\nAnd Bayina, can you just let me understand, could you repeat the second part of the question? You said you couldn't find EBITDA margin regarding what?\n\n---\n\nGuidance. Yes, what's your guidance for EBITDA margin for this year?\n\n---\n\nOkay. I mean, there was not actually a specific number for the EBITDA margin basically. What we are expecting is, again, a high single-digit consolidated volume growth on top of this. We expect the revenues to grow faster and EBITDA margin expansion. And that was actually the number. I think reasonably, we may try to -- we plan to go try nearing the 2013 figures because, obviously, 2014 is not a goal. Having said that, there are challenges and we would like to share performance throughout the year resulting in those challenges in attaining that margin expansion goal. Will that be clear enough?\n\n---\n\nYes. And on the CapEx?\n\n---\n\nOn the CapEx, we -- obviously, as you have seen in the months as well, we are now -- expect 3 greenfields -- sorry, 2 greenfields and 1 brownfield facilities to come on stream, one in Astana, Kazakhstan, the other one in Multan, Pakistan and 1 brownfield in Tajikistan, Dushanbe. So that suggests -- I think we would be spending some 80%, 85% of the annual CapEx outside of Turkey vis-à-vis Turkey in 2015. And as a total, I think we should be doing something on average of about 12%, which in -- or 12% of our revenue in 2015, which you should expect, given the fact that we continue to expect demand growth in Pakistan, especially in Iraq and in the Central Asian markets as well. That average we expect to maintain in the course of next 2 to 3 years.\n\n---\n\nMy question is regarding your international operations, regarding your potential cost pressures and your strategy regarding better to go for volumes or maintain margins. Can you elaborate on this?\n\n---\n\nKenan, I mean, we have not seen any significant cost pressures in our international markets because you know when the oil prices decline, usually we benefit from that. But the other side of the coin is in Turkmenistan, we had a devaluation, significant devaluation, a surprise actually as of January 1. And we had a recent devaluation in Azerbaijan, and there's some expectations about Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan at the same time because of the reflection of what's happening in Russia. Obviously, our main focus is profitability, but the sustainable profitable growth. So meaning that you're not going to choose only one of them. We will obviously focus on profitable growth. So the profit is #1, but we are not going to let go the volume opportunities or we're not going to lead the market to other players. So same time, we want to touch base on the affordability piece, so there are consumers who will consume beverages. And we want to hold on to our consumer base and even expand that, but the profitability is an important piece. So we cannot take our eyes off from the profitability. I don't know if that explains your question.\n\n---\n\nYes. And I just wonder, which one is your first priority for the timing? I just wonder.\n\n---\n\nProfits. Profits, obviously.\n\n---\n\nThis is Muneeza Hasan from JP Morgan. I just wanted to follow up on the question on your CapEx. So you said there are 2 lines coming up, 1 in Pakistan, 1 in Kazakhstan and 1 brownfield again in Kazakhstan. I think you have 2 more lines also in Pakistan. When are those lines coming? And for the 3 lines that will be operational this year, could you give some sense on which quarters then you could possibly will hit?\n\n---\n\nMuneeza, I mean, it's not the lines, actually, it's the production plants we are starting. So we have multiple production lines in those facilities. So 1 production plant in Multan, Pakistan, which has multiple lines in it. And then we have also another greenfield in Kazakhstan, Astana, which has multiple production lines again. And Dushanbe, which is a brownfield, so we just filed a x factory and we have converted that facility into a beverage plant, which has then multiple production lines as well. So we still have plans to expand, obviously, in Pakistan because Pakistan is growing, as you saw from the numbers 17% and it is proudly #1 for cola brand in Pakistan right now. So we will invest as long as we have the demand from the marketplace, and it will continue. I mean, in the near future, we have another greenfield plant in place and we will also be adding new production lines to our existing plants.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And the other question was on your cover for raw materials?\n\n---\n\nYes, what's that about raw materials?\n\n---\n\nYes. How much cover do you have in place? And with prices coming off, how do you see that play out? Would you expect some impact coming through in the first half itself? Or would you rather that it hits in the second half of 2015?\n\n---\n\nYes. Muneeza, hi, this is Orhun speaking. First of all, as we discussed a few things for 2015, one, we still see a quite benign raw material environment and the recent prices in our largest markets of operation versus in January, for example, this year versus the same period last year had been declining in low double-digits levels. And on revenue, for example, we've already pre-bought over 60% of our annual requirements. So we have a good, let's say, visibility on what our raw material cost prices are going to be. And obviously, as we move forward, the prices, we normally said we expect to change other than go start in the near future. We would like to see it would benefit that as well. If you look at sugar prices and other important obviously raw material, with the exception of Turkey, because in Turkey, I have to tell you, we still expect sugar prices to increase. Just like 2014 where the prices increased by 10%, in 2015, we still expect the price increase along those lines. However, markets outside of Turkey, we see again, and correct me, benign raw material environment especially in Central Asia, obviously, that's one of the, let's say, items for us as we look into 2015, together with Turkey where we see a margin opportunity as we see these raw material prices. And for sugar, basically, we've hedged over 90% of our requirements for 2015. So again, we do have a clear visibility of what the raw material price -- or no, of the sugar prices will be. Can prices, it's a mixed bag, but in some markets, it's still single-digit contraction; in some markets, over low-single-digit contraction; and some markets are low from single-digit increase, but overall, not necessarily significant changes to what we have experienced back in 2014. And again, the provisions that we will be taking provide us with visibility to our raw material base in 2015.\n\n---\n\nAnd just one final question. On your packaging in Turkey, last year, even though prices were down because of TRY depreciation, there was a margin hit. And we've seen year-to-date that TRY is again depreciated by 10%. You have increased prices in the fourth quarter, so do you think those price increases will be enough to offset any new depreciation that we've seen year-to-date? Or do you think that it will have another round of impact on your packaging costs in Turkey?\n\n---\n\nYes. Thank you. That's a good question. If you look at Turkey's cost base throughout 2014, for example, you'll see on a per-unit case basis, there was an 80% increase. And much of that increase actually -- a significant part of that increase was driven by the fixed disclosure in Turkey's cost base, which is about 27%. And obviously, if you look at the last quarter, that has implications as well because, obviously, devaluation, as we discussed, was a cost of 15% in 2015. Now somewhat good performance. Usually, the prevailing inflation and devaluation, but nevertheless, were the source of margin contraction for Turkey. Now what we do is -- look, if you look on the EBIT level and if you think of the currency, there are 2 things we need to discuss that impact CCI's consolidated results. One, the contribution that's coming from our international businesses, which are, as we discussed, reported in dollars. So any, let's say, Turkey's share weakness against the dollar actually is not by a very significant anchor in our -- coming from our international -- consolidation of our international business. And again, you'd remember these -- we've seen, for example, on EBIT line, as these businesses become quite, size-wise, comparable. Accordingly, experience in Turkey as a shortfall, we experienced the same amount of, let's say, improvement coming from international, so it's almost flat. Even in EBITDA, one could argue we could benefit in absolute terms of Turkey's share weakness. And moreover, what we discussed last year, we put in -- as this was one of the primary movers of our cost base in 2014, we put in some credit transactions in place for 2015 at the time of our -- especially purchases, so we actually increased or decreased the impact of FX exposure in Turkey's base as well to an extent. And that's how we're moving into 2015.\n\n---\n\nI just have one remaining question. On your short-term debt that you have of TRY 628 million, where does this debt sits? And what's your plan to refinance this debt?\n\n---\n\nThank you. Well, what you see in Turkey's share was actually the debt that we carried in Pakistan. And that's the, I would have to tell you, in 2015, probably the only funding requirement that we may have, given the demand growth in Pakistan and the consumer to be of capacity in the market, some of them is in the process of being refinanced with longer-term maturity debt, basically. And then that's -- then now we're going to move into 2015. Other than that, it's actually -- there is not -- there is no, let's say, short-term debt that we need to meet in 2015.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So it's mostly just Pakistan and a little bit of debt at the consolidated level?\n\n---\n\nYes. And then, of course, that's part is in dollars, part is in rupees because they -- and also have working capital requirements borrowed in local currency, in rupees, and that's what constitutes the short-term debt that you see in the balance sheet.\n\n---\n\nJust 2 quick questions. Could you tell us about the FX rates for your cash balance? And also, do you have any plans to hedge the outstanding Eurobonds, which is denominated in dollars?\n\n---\n\nLet me start from the second one. The answer is, yes, although it's a function of -- primarily a function of cost to us because, essentially, what we're doing is we are converting a noncash expense that creates volatility in our P&L with the cash interest that we're going to pay. And by way of comparison, in the course of last, let's say, 3 to 4 years, if you look at the net interest on our P&L, if you see an average of about, let's say, 13%, of which about 8% is roughly the average devaluation and diversity of interest that we're paying. And when we hedge it, it means all of it will become the interest that we pay. So basically, we have a plan in place and we seek to make -- well, we seek to put it in place as soon as we find a reasonable level that we can hedge from a cost perspective. If you look at the cash that sits on our balance sheet, we have a cash management policy in place whereby we like to carry half of the free cash in half currency that, let's say, a small anchorage to mitigate the net debt we carry or FX that we carry in our balance sheet. So therefore, most of the cash that you see are coming from 2014 with forward transactions. I don't have them on top of my head, the exact dates that we carry them, but I can tell you, they are a little bit than 2.40 levels, 2.30, 2.40 levels against the dollar, obviously.\n\n---\n\nI was just wondering whether you have an update on whether you might be adding any new market this year or in the coming years, if you have any guidance for that piece.\n\n---\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot give any guidance, but we can give you our intention. Our intention is clearly communicated with the Coca-Cola Company that we want to extend our footprint. And if any lifestyle, any opportunity comes to our table, we will evaluate it. And if it makes value and creates value for our shareholders, we will obviously be interested in the opportunity.\n\n---\n\nAre you looking at any specific deals at the moment?\n\n---\n\nI mean, we obviously look in everything, but there's nothing specific on the radar right now.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then in terms of the size of a potential transaction, where would you -- how leveraged would you let the balance sheet go for a meaningful deal?\n\n---\n\nThat's an interesting question. In theory, what we have disclosed in the past is that we may lever our balance sheet up to 2x net debt-to-EBITDA. Having said that, our long-term policy in line with our, let's say, investment-grade positions to get back to 2x net debt-to-EBITDA levels or lower. Now the reason why I'm saying this in theory because as we don't know what exactly we're talking about, obviously, we don't know the level of EBITDA or debt that we would be absorbing through such a transaction. But at least in theoretical terms, that's what we could think of, let's say, as a ballpark guideline.\n\n---\n\nWell, thank you. Let me say a few words about our overall performance. As I said, 2015 is going to be another challenging year, but we have the experience and the capability to go through these rough waters. But I'm glad to see that we [indiscernible] strong top line growth despite the weak consumer sentiment in Turkey and some major adversities in the international markets. We continue to focus on beverage category on packaged mix management, and we are confident that our strong, balanced portfolio and geography footprint will continue to provide healthy top line and profitability growth going forward. We believe that there are plenty of opportunities to grow our business in all markets where we operate, and we have the right competencies to explore these opportunities, obviously.\r\nSo I would like to thank you, all, for your participation in the call, and wish you a great day. Thank you very much.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Bayina Bashtaeva (Analysts)】\nThis is Bayina Bashtaeva from Barclays. Just a few questions. First of all, I'm curious, what's your view on the Turkish consumer demand for this year? It just looks like your qualitative guidance for this year for Turkish volume is pretty much the same as you guided for 2014, even though it's more expected that the consumer demand should improve in Turkey this year. That's the first question. And second question, what is your EBITDA margin outlook for this year? I couldn't find it in your notes. And finally, on CapEx.

Let me say a few words about our overall performance. As I said, 2015 is going to be another challenging year, but we have the experience and the capability to go through these rough waters. But I'm glad to see that we [indiscernible] strong top line growth despite the weak consumer sentiment in Turkey and some major adversities in the international markets. We continue to focus on beverage category on packaged mix management, and we are confident that our strong, balanced portfolio and geography footprint will continue to provide healthy top line and profitability growth going forward. We believe that there are plenty of opportunities to grow our business in all markets where we operate, and we have the right competencies to explore these opportunities, obviously.\r\nSo I would like to thank you, all, for your participation in the call, and wish you a great day. Thank you very much.",

On behalf of the Investment Analysts Society in Southern Africa, we would like to thank at the outset, Sanlam, Dr. Johan van Zyl, members of the board, the executive for hosting us here today in the presentation of the results for the period ending December 2014.\r\nSanlam is one of the pillars of South African society. It is the custodian of people savings and of investments and in more recent years focused on capitalizing on the opportunities in the emerging markets of this world.\r\nSanlam was formed, came into being or just after the first World War in 1918. It is a mutual company and demutualized itself in 1998. It is -- today, it has a market capitalization of ZAR 160 billion. It is one of the top biggest companies in South Africa in terms of market capitalization, and employees just on 13,000 people, and it is the home for people savings and also for employment. As I said, there is full of society, and this is manifested in the share price, which has risen from some ZAR 6, some 12x to 13x over the past few years since listing. So Dr. van Zyl and to the members of the management, who will be addressing us this morning, once again, thank you, and we look forward to having greater insight into Sanlam as a company, as an enterprise the past, the present and the future.  Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThank you so much for that kind introduction. It's always nice to be hosted by the Investment Analysts Society here in Johannesburg when we do announce our results. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Welcome. We will be talking a bit on what we've done in the last year, but before we start just a bit of welcome and I would like to welcome the Sanlam Chairman, Desmond Smith, the Chairman of our Audit and Risk Committee -- Audit Committee; Philip Rademeyer, number of executives that we have over here, Yegs Ramiah, [indiscernible], Themba Gamedze. I see Temba Mvusi here. Hubert Brody that's joined us recently from Imperial. And then, people will help me with the presentation, Ian Kirk, our CEO-Designate and presently the Deputy CEO of Sanlam; Kobus Möller, our Financial Director; and also Andre Zeeman, our Chief Actuary and Risk Officer.\r\nLadies and gentlemen, I'll be handling mainly the strategy and the operating environment. If we start off, then we will have Kobus Möller talking a bit about strategic delivery, and what has happened into the financial review. Priorities will be handled in the businesses by Ian and I will end off with 1 or 2 things that we plan to do in the rest of the year and issues that we have to look out for.\r\nIf we really look at the strategy, it is all about maximizing shareholder value. And we have a diagram that we really would like to drive in our own case returns on group equity value, which is the measure that we put forward. This is how we incentivized. This is how we measure ourselves. And in order to do that, we have a whole lot of strategic pillars within the business. We want to grow the business, operational efficiencies. Key part is capital optimization, diversification, transforming our business. And then, there's a whole lot of other strategic enablers like concentricity, doing the right thing, responsible -- products, a prosperous society.  These are the things that we focus on. If we really look at the key part of what we do. South Africa is still our home. It is a big part of what we do. We have a mature business here. So it's really about maximizing the return on the South African business. There is a lot of efficiencies and effectiveness issues that we have to do and that we have to drive out efficiencies, so it's about getting the return on our investment, a lot of it is mature. This is where we get the cash flow. This is where we get the dividend that we actually pay.\r\nAnd then through the process on the right, the capital management, drive out the surplus capital as old more capital policy -- or capital-intensive policies mature, using that capital, using some of the profit to apply to -- into higher growth areas, where we get higher returns, so it's really about that sourcing of new growth opportunities, making the investments and then growing those businesses and through both investment, but increasingly so also through organic growth, because our footprint is also quite big.\r\nAnd that is the story. It's been the story for a while. And we think there is quite a bit of it left. A few remarks on the operating environment. The environment is being fairly tough. Not the toughest that we've seen, but it is a difficult environment to operate in.\r\nThe business environment itself is characterized by weak global economy. It's not only low-growth rates in South Africa and unemployment that is driving things, but the pressure on the South African economy, I think, is very prevalent, and we also see it in our own numbers. Global demand has dropped off quite a bit, particularly for resources. We've seen in our own economy also substantial industrial action and we were impacted heavily by it.\r\nIn our Sanlam Sky business, for instance, we write quite a bit of our business in the platinum area. Rustenburg has been one of our major branches. And as we know, for full on 6 months last year, we sold way under what should have been done in that area, because of industrial action. Just as we got that right and got that going, we had low churning and other things that put pressure on how people see it and then their ability to save.\r\nAnd all of this, resulted in relatively low level of growth in the economy, but particularly so in disposable income with large segments of our particular retail client being under pressure.\r\nIn Africa, outside of South Africa, much more resilience despite pressure on income from resources, also in the oil-producing countries, but a lot of currency volatility, fortunately increasingly. We are about a basket of areas that we work in. It is about a portfolio of businesses. And in that lies an inherent stability. We focus on those areas, where there are opportunities and maybe close to that a little bit, where we have headwinds. And overall, the result is a very pleasing one.\r\nAnd India, growth is below the long-term potential, but massive optimism after the elections with share prices goes on doubling in the last few months or so. Investment markets, lots of volatility and lots of momentum investors and so forth, and particularly the value investors being hurt in many areas.\r\nLots of risk aversion in the market, and very difficult to get things right. But having said that a few numbers here, you can see the economy, the growth and so not doing very well. And in the long term, this is the picture that we have to play in about 70%, 75% of our business. This is the CAR that we've been built with. It is a tough one.  So increasingly, we're diversified. If you look at interest rates, a key part of our results and how things go forward. This is the 2 top lines there. The 9-year bond rate and the 5-year bond rate determine actually our discount rates for our middle market and our lower end of the market both of them.\r\nAnd if you really look at the top there, we've seen a 10 basis points lower discount rate that we're using for the middle and the affluent market, which has had a slightly positive effect and negative effect coming from the increase in the discount rate for the lower end of the market. The net value of new business impacting about 2% negatively by not so much. I think the absolute levels of the curve much more the point than the shape of where we're at. So new business margin because of those movements about 5 basis points down. But by and large, I think not much movement coming from interest rates.\r\nYou've seen a slight pickup in the short-term interest rates, which of course a 20 basis points tick up there, a slight tick up you can see in the lower end. The short-term interest rates, we have a lot of cash that we've invested at that rate, so our profit being slightly higher on that.\r\nIf we look at the equity markets, a major driver is that average Alsi up about 17% in the 2 years. We haven't had as great a year in 2014 as in the previous year. And this has resulted, of course, negatively on particularly our headline earnings, where we include a lot of our investment and Kobus will talk a bit about that.\r\nBut by and large, I think fairly pleasant picture on the bond side as well. On average, a higher base and because we didn't fizz in our asset management type business off the base, you would see the base was 17% up. We've done pretty well in those businesses.\r\nIf you really look at the exchange rates, increasingly as we move offshore, these things do impact us. The rand weakened about most of the pillar, against most of the developed currencies, where we operate. And you would see places like the U.K. and Europe having a bigger contribution to our profits, because the rand is weakened. That has helped us. In Botswana and India less so, but still a strengthening of those currencies relative to the rand. The rest of Africa, though, I spoke about currency volatility at the beginning, you can see we've been hurt by those currencies weakening against the rand by 3%.   Overall, the net result from financial services, our operating profit up 1.7% because of currency issues.\r\nNew business volumes up by about 1.4%, but value of new business coming mainly out of Africa down by 0.3%. So not too much, but overall a positive contribution coming from the currency valuation. \r\nIf we look at what's been achieved in the past year in the delivery, a key part of what we're driving [indiscernible], of course, the results. But we really look at the business quite carefully. We do a lot of investment into the business upfront, incur new business strength as long as that is positive, and which it makes our hurdle rate, so that we can get the profits into the future. We treat a lot of our business like that. It is all about capital, the management, the investment decision and so. Within that sort of a framework, our net operating profit per share increased by a very credible 26% over the past year. We're very just about that, normalized headline earnings a bit lower, mainly because the market didn't contribute as much in the past year, only about a 10% increase in the market as opposed to close to -- well, close to 20% increase in the previous period. So normalized headline earnings fairly flat. And in that, we incurred quite a bit of new business strength, because of the growth that you see below. New business volumes up 18% on how you know across the board, net funding flows up ZAR 42 billion. Those things don't mean as much. They're very positive and but you know an indication that things have gone well. They say nothing about margin. If we look about the margin stuff, our net life value of new business up 21%, up to ZAR 1.6 billion. And that of course, a big chunk of that incurs new business strength, particularly on the risk side, the EB side and so forth. This is where we had a negative impact because of the high growth on the actual profit that we've shown. But we will talk about that later when Kobus comes with his financial results. The margin is fairly flat on a per product basis maintained a bit of mix towards the higher or the lower yielding margins, more savings products in South Africa as opposed to risk and that sort of thing.\r\nGroup equity value, which is really a key part of what we try to drive. Group equity value at the end of December was of last year, ZAR $46.84 per share. We're pretty proud of what is being achieved there with a return on group equity value over the past year of 18.5%. On a normalized basis, that can help the market, which has been fairly flat about 18% return. This is how we measure ourselves. We have hurdles that we would like to achieve, and that is probably the main reason why we trade at the -- as the share price trade at substantially above the group embedded value. It is because our return is substantially more than simply the unwind of the discount rate.\r\nSo overall, if we look at the efficiencies in the business, the trick is not to only be bigger, but to be better. And the big part of it lies in growing the value of new business. I'm very happy to say that this has been a recurring story with about another 20% increase gross value of new business, 20% up over the period. In EB, we've had a very large single policy at a bit of a lower margin, overall, it decreased the margin a little bit. You would see that coming down. But on a per product basis, the margin very similar to the previous years, and increasingly you see the new territories that we've added and how it just makes a difference with the cherry on top. We're very proud of what is being achieved here. As I've said, of course, this incurs quite substantial new business trends on the risk in EB side, with EB's contribution being a major part of the growth there. And therefore, it's -- it impacted negatively on operating profit, despite of that still the 26% growth is very credible.\r\nQuality is key for us. We don't like to write business that will disappear before we made our money. You've see a slight uptick in 2013 in the second half from -- in lapses, surrenders fully paid ups. Mainly the Section 14 transfers, which is about administration, but we are also net gaining from a whole lot of that, which we don't show in the net number, but this is our book and the lapses as a percentage of book in the middle market. You can see after the strain that we've taken in the first half of the year a substantially better second half, also better than the second half of last year, and that is pretty good for us. And this goes to show a bit about the health of the South African consumer and our focus on different segments of the market. We feel happy with that. And overall, we don't see too many problems there for us. In the lower end of the market, persistency is a big issue. You've seen in the later half of 2013, industrial action, resulting and particularly that Rustenburg platinum area, in the later half of 2013, the beginning of 2014, with lapses ticking up a little bit, and have big chunk of that coming exactly from that. As soon as things started normalizing, we were able with [indiscernible] and the team there were doing a sterling job, getting things back to where we would like it to be and you see the persistency increasing there and lapses coming down a bit, so overall also a pretty pleasing story in terms of quality.\r\nAlways -- a slide on the experience variances and it's been a big part of the profit, where we simply do better on what assumptions are. Again, a number of sources of this. The big bulk of this experiences vary coming from risk, where we outperform in terms of what we assumed the assumptions to be, still well within that range of 3% and 4% of the value of enforce, but still a pleasing number at close to ZAR 1 billion of positive experience variances and of course, that help quite substantially in getting the return on group equity value up quite a bit.\r\nIf we look at our investment performance, I think we've had a very good year, a very sterling year. In fact, in a year where particularly, as I've said earlier, where value investors struggled. No clear direction in the market, difficult to fund opportunities, but I think our team [indiscernible] has done a sterling job. We've outperformed the benchmarks consistently by between about 100 and 200 basis points over the past 3 to 5 years rolling basis. And I think that puts us in a very good state. And a big part of our results is the shop window that is being created there under [indiscernible] to ship actually not only for the investment side of the business, but for a whole lot of our saving industry coming through SPF, personal loans businesses and so forth. So overall, I think a very credible number and something to be really proud of.\r\nWe're also in this business achieved quite a bit of -- on the profit side, achieved quite a bit of performance fees that Kobus, I'm sure, will allude to. The theme of diversification is key, not only in South Africa, but also in once we go beyond diversification on essentially for France. We used to be at middle market business only focusing on African business around 10, 15, 20 years ago. We've been able to diversify that middle market base. We've added the high end of the market through businesses in Malaysia, the mass affluent space, the high network space in Sanlam personal wealth, used to be Sanlam personal investments that we rebranded. In the lower end of the market through Sanlam sky, really expanding our business quite a bit on what we do and then the back end and the investment size and then going -- following our clients offshore in the high end and to niche areas in the developed markets, and into Africa, Southeast Asia, India, Malaysia and so in the middle market. So this is a key part. If we really look at our equity value, where our investments and value sit around 50% now in life business, down from about 80%, 10-odd years or so ago, a substantial contribution from general insurance, investment management, credit and banking, admin, health other stuff, surplus capital and so, so a much more, I think, robust and diversified base.\r\nAnd if we look at the profit that, that base generates to the right hand side there also much more diversified. Life being particularly profitable, once you've added the African businesses on to that. General insurance doing well. Investment management across the board carrying a bit more than its fair share of credit and banking, while only being 9% of our investment contributing roughly about 14% of our profit. So we're in the -- must be in some of the sweet spots in that area, so overall much more diversified.\r\nAnd if you look at that picture of diversification geographic stuff, every year we're strengthening that. We're into 10 African countries now, actually 11 by adding Mozambique there. We're into India and Malaysia, places where they speak English, the emerging market side. In the developed markets areas, we're into U.K., Ireland, Switzerland and we have now presence in Australia and U.S.A.\r\nAnd these businesses now contribute roughly about a quarter of our profit about 15% or 2/3 of it from the African base, the emerging markets base and about 1/3 of it from the developed market space, both of those businesses grew quite substantially on average close to 30%, but more importantly gave us a return of roughly 28%. So that's a big part of our business more than 25 doing very well. We'll see most of these places, they speak English, which means we can support them from Johannesburg.\r\nAnd although we maybe small in the countries we then can because of having a big base that we spread between the businesses, we spread that fixed cost investment, we can operate as if we're big in those places with the support coming from South Africa, following a partnership approach where we have great partners in those countries.\r\nSo overall, we're very happy with that approach. It provides opportunities to increase our investments to broaden our footprint and so forth. So overall, I think, a pleasing -- having been at that for quite further a while, I think Johan [indiscernible] have done a great job in creating footprint with many moving parts, where we have optionality into the future. And if you really look at how the businesses is growing from a traditional South African base 10 years or so ago to 1 that is much more diversified, where the traditional base still is important. We've added some new business into that traditional base like credit and so. So about 40% of what we use to have 10 years ago, still doing well, 60% of profits coming from new areas that we've added to that.\r\nThe entry-level market, Namibia, our emerging spaces, the rest of Africa, other international so doing fairly well.\r\nAnd if we really look the contribution to net operating profit over that time, not only have we've been able to grow the size of the pie, but also the composition. And this is the key part of it. We are now have many moving part, we have optionality as I have said, and it's a really -- I think a great story if you look at the progression. And into the future, it provides lots of optionality. You can now partner and focus on the area with potential, wait a little bit if there are headwinds in other areas and drive the things forward.\r\nThe overall picture is as you see in terms of investments on the right-hand side of the picture there, we now have 23% of our investments offshore, but they give us or gave us 26% of our profit on the left-hand side.\r\nAnd in terms of life, the future and so forth, you can see a pretty picture, a big chunk of it is offshore. Of course, a big part of our investments into Africa and India and so forth, not on the life side, but a big part of it is in general insurance side and also in credit and banking, and overall those complexes doing very well for us.\r\nCapital efficiency, a key theme over the past 10, 12 years. We've redeployed close to ZAR 30 billion over the past 8 to 10 years into buying back shares into your, first of all, selling our stake in APSA, then using that money wisely and buying back shares when we were underpriced.\r\nBuying businesses like African Life, building other businesses of that base, going into Africa, into the U.K., we have returns of well over 20% from those investments. So overall, it's done very well for us. In the past year, net basis ZAR 1.9 billion invested, we've done deals of around ZAR 3 billion, ZAR 3.2 billion. We sold some businesses in the U.K. And in India, reinvested that money elsewhere, so ZAR 1.9 billion on net basis invested. We realized another ZAR 930 billion from our operations, mainly returns on surplus cash, also a small part of dividends that we didn't pay out, the cash dividend added to that part of that ZAR 930 billion. We also got ZAR 185 billion from selling part of our stake in emerging markets, where we have short-term insurance exposure to Santam. They own now 35% of that. It's key that they support us there through their expertise, but also by having skin on the -- in the game.\r\nSo a key part of that and then discretionary capital at the year end, up about ZAR 3.3 billion, substantially allocated for acquisitions. Having just a word or 2 on that, we have quite a big pipeline. This is what -- how we came to that. We have quite big pipeline for that ZAR 3.3 billion. We already announced towards the end of last year, ZAR 700-odd million due with buying a small -- 30-odd percent stake into mid scheme [ph]. There's a big movement in India towards lifting the FDI limit of 26% in insurance to 49%. All indications are -- is that the rules it's already been announced. It's been through decree by the pause that be in India. They're now sorting out the rules. We think that should be done in the next month or so. And to take up our additional option of going to 49 there and the insurance companies will be another ZAR 600 million, ZAR 700 million. And then we have a whole lot of smaller bolt-on type transactions, both in South Africa, but also in -- particularly Africa and elsewhere, and that will take, in my mind, the bulk of what we have available.\r\nHopefully, we will add again during the year to this number. So -- but a pretty picture. I think with that sort of a basic story, very similar to what we've been talking about over the last 5 years, another step I think towards realizing our objectives, I would like to hand over to Kobus Möller, our Financial Director to talk a bit about the numbers. Kobus?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Johan. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We start off with just -- quickly on presentation and assumptions. I think we were fortunate this year that we didn't have any major IFRS changes or changes in our basis of presentation, so you'll find it very similar to last year, the comparison.\r\nAnd similar with our changes in long risk contracts in the long rate, as Johan already indicated, just a 10% -- 10 basis point change in the 9-year yield and 20 basis points up in the 5-year yield, so the discount rate for Sanlam Life 10.6% and 10.1% for Sanlam Sky. And we made some of the adjustments to our value discount rate that we applied for the valuation of our unlisted investments we used discounted cash flow, so very similar to last year in terms of valuations.\r\nYou've seen some of these numbers, equity value of ZAR 47 this year, return of 18.5% on that.\r\nAll our business remained well capitalized, Sanlam Life the CAR cover ZAR 4.5 million similar to last year. And then operating profit increased of 26% on this year basis, and our normalized headline earnings 3% up. On the back of those earnings, the board declared -- started declaring dividend of two hundred twenty five cents a share, which is 12.5% up on last year. And I think it's line with the policy that we -- as we followed a smooth growth in dividend based on the available cash earnings of the underlying businesses. So more or less following the same level of cover of cash earnings that we followed in the past. Life business growth of 33% and also very good net fund flows and life business value of no business, up 20%, 21%. \r\nThe next few slides, I'm just going to cover some of the highlights of the individual businesses starting with Sanlam Personal Finance, very good growth in the insurance business overall segment 14% growth, and Sanlam Sky that is the one area that we had the downside of the platinum strikes earlier in the year, which impacted on particular our agency force and the sales in that environment. I think the pleasing part of the result is that we carried throughout the year, overall, we had a 14% growth in our agency force for sales,  and it's actually 18% up in the last half of the year. So a good recovery in that environment. The negative thing was that we had some less sales -- group life sales. It's more chunky business, so that was down about 30%, essentially contributing to that minus 2% for the year. \r\nIndividual life business that's very well similar story than before, very good single premiums, good RA sales, somewhat negative performance from our risk business, minus 3% that negatively impact on the overall growth, but still very good growth overall in the individual life. Glacier that -- well, again, good flows on to your platform there, was finished 27% growth and you can also see that in the net flows of almost 20 billion ramped at SPF achieved, a big part of that actually in Glacier. A big part of that being new investment flows on to our administration platform. The value of new business in SPF followed more or less the trend of the life business flows. So you can see that increase of 10% in the value of new business with Sanlam Sky similar to last year, essentially because of the level of sales on the group site. The individual life, 14% increase. And the margins are more or less similar to last year, as Johan also said, on a by product basis, and essentially the same. And the only reason for that slight drop in the overall margins is the higher growth in Glacier, where the margins are slightly lower than the rest of the business. \r\nOverall, it's still about 3%, 3.1% average margin that we have achieved and have expressed that on a comparable interest basis, it's very similar. The profit contribution from SPF, I think that is one of the highlights for the year, it's exceptionally good performance to increase the profit contribution to less than ZAR 3.5 billion, 19% in a relatively mature business. I think the 2 areas that certainly help them in that is the higher asset base, so the unfees particularly, in the individual life, on the book -- huge in-force book that we have and also in Glacier we earn fees on the in-force book that had a big impact -- positive impact on the earnings contribution and then also Sanlam Sky and individual life both had a very good underwriting performance, particularly with valid the experience, very good investment in the period, contributing to the 25% or 19% increases that we've seen there. \r\nPersonal loans, the profitability of that book remains intact, 4% growth is really a result of us getting back on the growth in the book. So no issues with the profitability, but we didn't grow the book by that much. I think the book is now close to ZAR 4 billion from about ZAR 3.6 billion a year ago. \r\nThe cluster -- yes, we have clustered yield a return of almost 18% on equity value for the year, again, well above the target that we set for them. And if you compare that with a similar or even a higher return in 2013, a very good 2 years, actually for the SPF cluster. \r\nEmerging markets that dwell on the volume side, 27% growth in insurance business that includes both life insurance and general insurance. The life insurance business up by about 15%, Botswana and particularly, it's very well on the annuity side -- annuity business we have done, and Rest of Africa and India and Malaysia reflect some of the acquisitions that we've made in the last year, in particular the phasing in of the contribution of some of the general insurance businesses, but overall very good flows that we've experienced across the border from our businesses and you can also see that in the net fund flows plus ZAR 4 billion in net fund flows that those businesses have achieved. \r\nValue of new business follow the growth in the new life business, 18% increase in the margins are also more or less the same as last year, also a bit of a mix to change the average is likely higher but it's still a very good margin that we make in the business in Africa in particular. The profit contribution of selling emerging markets, ZAR 1.2 billion on a net basis, up 23% on last year. Again, that's a combination of growth of the existing businesses. The organic growth which was about 16%. On top of that is the contribution made by the acquisitions that we have made over time. In particular India, Malaysia, [indiscernible] where we bought indirect interest in Bank Windhoek that made the contributions of it. Botswana had a very good year, but in general, I think across the board our businesses performed very well, we had 1 or 2 areas like in Ghana where the currency made a negative impact on the results. We didn't perform that well, but we're quite happy, I think, with the overall performance of all our businesses in this last -- and as I said, this is now making substantial contributions on our results already, the ZAR 1.2 billion. And the return that we achieved on that cluster, 28% return in the value of the businesses there, the equity value and are operating ZAR 15 billion, becoming quite a sizable part of our business and relative -- and last year, we had a 30% return. This year, 28% return. So you can see that we actually achieved quite a big return on our investment in that businesses, which we are very happy. Sanlam Investments, the net investment flows of ZAR 4 billion for the year, which is quite a credible performance if you take into account that we've actually lost about ZAR 10 billion of PRC flows in the year and in wealth management that also lost about ZAR 2.5 billion of very low margin business that we have done for [indiscernible] companies. And to achieve a ZAR 4 billion net flows in that environment, I thinks it's excellent performance. New insurance business have the benefit of about -- the ZAR 8 billion single premium that is annuity business that we've sold in the year, that obviously, helped that -- the numbers there, or the 90% increase there. And that is also reflected in the value of new business, more than doubled and a big part of that increase is actually due to the single premium business -- the single premium policy that we sold during the year. \r\nThe operating profit contribution from the investment cluster, up 13% to just up below ZAR 1.5 billion. The investment business looked very well. I think they are the benefit of a higher base but as Johan also indicated that the investment performance resulted in quite a nice performance fees. I think maybe the one highlight is that even without the performance fees, the properties still up by about 20% and so the performance certainly helped -- get the higher base, but the underlying business is also doing very well. The employee benefits had a 16% drop in profit and that's the one area where we actually incurred the new business trailing on the big policy that we wrote. We had the benefit this year to have some modeling adjustments that we've made, so we could release some results. So the net effect on the profit is only about ZAR 137 million negative, if you take those 2, both the new business [indiscernible]. So without the employee benefits, profit would have been about 30% higher, which is a better reflection of the actual performance in that business, in particular, on the risk side, they have a very, very good year since it's distorted by the new business claim that we have to be incurred. The capital management, the 12% growth in net profit for the year. And the cluster in total yield of the return of 30%, again, well above our hurdle. And the positive side is that both the covered business and the non-covered business both yielded an excess of 20% returns. \r\nSantam had a exceptional yield last year as you had seen in their results already, underwriting margin increasing from 2.8% to 8.7%. Each turnaround in the crop business, the agricultural business, but the overall business has actually performed very well, to contribute to that performance. And if you invested in a Sanlam share, our investment in Santam over the -- last year yielded a 19% return. So the overall picture in terms of business growth, 18% growth in new business flows, gross flows and maybe the one -- I just want to clarify, the emerging markets share were minus 5, that's essentially because we've sold the Capricorn Unit Trust business in Namibia last year. If you exclude that from the base, the increase there is less than 40% the real actual increase like-for-like. And overall, you'll see we've achieved good net flows in all our businesses, less than ZAR 42 billion for the year. \r\nThe value of new covered business up by 21%, net of minorities, so the Sanlam portion of that less than ZAR 1.6 billion as we've seen good contributions from all our businesses, and obviously, they're not substantial jump in the Employee Benefits and this is for the year. For the margins remaining always similar to the year ago. Our overall net operating profit increased 27%, again all businesses contributing to that with this -- I mean the standard performance for the year being at of Santam each recovery and the contribution for the year. And our income statement, Johan already alluded to that, that investment returns down 40% in the -- that's the investment returns on our shareholders funds, that's really just a factor of the lower equity returns and also in 2013, we have the benefit of the depreciating rand in our international assets, which then took the same extent in this year. So lower returns are still within our normal assumptions and therefore, the investment returns is much lower than last year, and therefore, the drop in the investment return number and that contributed to the [indiscernible] earnings being down only by 3%. \r\nOur total Group Equity Value, the contribution or the composition of that. In total, less than ZAR 96 billion now and you can see the major contributors, the biggest tool being personal finance, but an increasing contribution now from emerging markets, almost ZAR 15 billion, as I said, and within investments about ZAR 6 billion of the ZAR 20 billion is International assets. So the international component of our equity value is now above ZAR 20 billion and you can see the ROTV [ph] that those individual businesses yielded for the year, all above the hurdles that we've set, all above 17%, 18% and the international component of that yield is about a 27% return. So a very good performance and we are very pleased off in terms of international contribution, but also our local South African business is doing very well. \r\nSince 18.5% return, and if you normalize that for the market, it's about 18%. And just looking at the different components in the build up of the group equity value earnings, starting with the covered business, the value of new business, the ZAR 1.6 billion on our existing in-force book, growth of earnings of ZAR 4.9 billion, including ZAR 991 million, almost ZAR 1 billion of experience variances -- positive experience variances, bulk of that would be part of that being mortality experience, good mortality experience in particular in the SPF side, but we have good experiences across our book. \r\nOperating assumptions changes at ZAR 522 million, part of that, but half of that is really capitalize some of the positive experiences, variances and then the other half would be more or less would be the modeling changes that I referred to earlier, we release some reserves. Our in-force book at the benefit of the higher equity markets -- the market that had another ZAR 550 million, and then in terms of our policy, we actually don't account for any goodwill in our GEV when we acquire life companies, so when we did the acquisition in Malaysia, in CIS, we most likely more than embedded values so we write off the goodwill in our GEV calculations. So that's from the bulk of ZAR 168 million is that. So if you add to the return of the net worth, the ZAR 1.3 billion, it's about ZAR 8.2 billion return on our covered business and that's about 19% return for the year. And we had a similar return of approximately 19% on our non-life businesses of about ZAR 7.3 billion to get to the ZAR 15.6 billion, overall. And on the right hand side, you can actually see the adjustments that we made to get to our normalized return, which is very similar to the return -- the normal return for the year. \r\nSo just last slide, in summary, I think in my view the results will show that we are on track to deliver on our strategy. I think we still add shareholder value by RoGEV returns, we had some strong profitable growth, and I think the pleasing part is that most of our businesses make strong contributions to the growth, 22% growth in VNB, operating profits growth and the diversification continues to add to our performance with our investment in the growth markets and as you also would have seen the bulk of our investments -- our capital investments in the past year, according to those growth markets and that will also continue to be the trend that we will look at as growth markets for the application of the ZAR 3.3 billion. With that, I'll hand you over to Ian to talk about the priorities for 2015.\n\n---\n\nKobus, thank you. Let me start by saying thank you to many of you in the room for the good wishes that you've sent me. Thank you, also for some of the suggestions that you've sent me. I greatly appreciate it. It's sort of privilege and honor for me to leave the group through the next stage of its development and a lot to do and that's very exciting, including the centenary year. So just before I get into the priorities, just a couple of comments. Number one is, I'm 9 weeks in the business. So please don't expect me to have all the answers. I've been, obviously, associated with the group since 2006, but I'm going through this transition phase. It's been well-structured by the board and by Johan and Johan is with us for the rest of the year, and I'm getting into it on an appropriate basis. One of the biggest mistakes, I think, I could make in this job is to assume I know stuff because I've been in the industry for long and I have been associated with the group. So this is a very important process of hand over. \r\nAnd second thing is, the business is in good shape, you can see from the results over a period of time, strategy is well set, it's being well-executed, there are no burning platforms. There are challenges, there's no doubt, there are challenges, mainly the external challenges, Johan is going to talk about it upfront, he's going to talk a bit about the end and of course, the challenges associated with the base. But the business is in good shape, so there's no dramatic need to get stuck and make changes. The other important point, I think, I'd like to make upfront is that don't assume a new CE equates to a new strategy. I've been involved with this, it does happen, it can happen, it has happened in financial services, it won't necessarily happen with someone to make that point upfront. Whatever happens we'll evolve over time, it will be a team effort. And just with regard to that, just to mention Hubert. Hubert joined us from Imperial 1st of January, so he is also a 9-weeker like myself. And his experience in banking and then subsequently the Investment Banking. Johan and I are not directing Hubert in a particular direction, but obviously, he is looking at the capital, he is looking for the strategy, and we'll hear from him next month as we go forward. \r\nOkay. So just to word about the priorities for these businesses as we go forward. The SPF business has done really well. You'll the results on the risk side in the year that's sold. So profitable business over a period of time. But we do see some opportunities to get the volumes up in that regard and some new players have come into the market with some new ideas and some new changes. The team have been busy towards the end of last year and have come up with some new ways of doing the business. So we think in the risk business we can do better. On the Sky side, we've predominantly filling the funeral business. We're resisted selling savings plans into that and the back of the TCF guidance and also the fundamental principle of Sanlam that we need offer value to customers in the savings products, some of the competitors have not done that. We think some new opportunity is there around techview[ph] savings and some other things that we've come up with. \r\nSo I think we'll be expanding that product range and as well as the bit distribution footprint. We are strong in certain areas. We have some opportunities in other geographies in the country. On the Glacier side, there's a new opportunities around savings products on the international side as well, and we can sell some more risk business into that base, on the Glacier side. MiWay is a different venture, as you all know, it's been done by others in South Africa and around the world. MiWay now has short-term insurance base of around 250,000 plans, which is a great achievement over 7 or 8 years. But you'd be interested to know that on the dollar base is substantially more than that. In fact, many of you on the room here are probably on the dollar base. So there is a very huge dollar base, and now, we can use that base and the skill that's been set up. There will be a J curve on MiWay on the life side, but not a substantial as we were starting from scratch. So I think it's a nice opportunity there. That's a different segment. It's a different market, different lifestyle type experience, the direct. It won't be as in short-term, whether it will be the significant part of the retail market will be direct, but the number is growing. We've looked at this. We've looked at what the brokers are delivering. We've looked at what the agents are delivering and we looked at how that growth in directors is coming out. It will mirror less --  it's actually as an opportunity, for us through the intermediaries and also on the direct basis, the legislation is coming effective on March. So we're busy with that. We're not going to sleep. We've got our product range, in fact, I'm sure there are a few agents. If you go online, sanlam.co.za, you can start buying now some of the product. It takes few savings products and I think that's a nice opportunity for us. It's a big mature business. We'll need to continue to look at the operational efficiencies on the distribution side, on the network and on the operations side. \r\nAnd of course, regulatory form is significant. SAM, you will understand we've talked about that before TCF as well, the big one now for us, of course, is the retail distribution. Reveal those significant changes. We're positive with that. We've identified what we think needs to change. We think the regulator here will be responsible. We know what's happened in U.K. We know what's happened in Australia. We've seen that. They've also seen that. We're working through a scissor [ph]. So we think -- we trust, we hope if any other regulators are here, we trust that they will be responsible in how we deal with this issue. So we see some opportunities there, not just the downside. \r\nOn the Emerging Markets side, you've seen from Johan and from Kobus what's been achieved. It's fantastic. It really has been a great story, but that story is not over, we can -- So by deepening the relationships and the opportunities that arise, as Johan indicated about India and the legislation changes that opportunity we get a chance to live to equity, the same opportunity exists in Africa and obviously in Southeast Asia as well. And it's about deepening that product range, particularly on the asset management side, on the pension’s fund, et cetera. We're strong on the life side, we're strong on the general side in many of the countries, some of the general companies we need to lift a bit. And those are considerable opportunities. It will remain on Africa in the Southeast Asia for structural growth, no doubt. We're looking at Francophone and Lusophone, Mozambique is the first entry there. We tended to move off a bit, not get too active in that in the initial years because of the culture and because of language, et cetera, regulatory system a little bit and not the same as in English-speaking countries, but our team has got a bit more confidence there now. \r\nShriram was introducing the [indiscernible] investment into the Shriram group has created a lot of capital opportunity there as well, under -- so we will look with Shriram and some of the opportunities in Southeast Asia. And I think a very important thing that will take place over the next few years is how we will vest the Sanlam brand in the mind of consumers, the intermediaries. Who've got -- obviously, we also move into a pan African scenario and importantly, for the employees that have been part of the Sanlam group mean something different. So they're not just sitting in the subsidiary or in the associated company in Malawi that actually fill part and parcel. I'm not saying we're going to transition to a multinational that will become more of a -- certainly a pan-African play. And that is important, I think, for the clients, for the intermediates, and for us now. So that's a good story and then there's a lot to do there. \r\nOn the investment side, I mean, Johan said that time and time again, priority 1, priority 2 and priority 3 in this business is investment performance. Johan is taking you through some of the steps there as to where we position ourselves. That's been good and if it's not good, it's very, very difficult to sell. We've had that experience many years ago as well. So the focus will remain on that. Having said that, the refreshed brand now that's been done around the world switches [ph], I'm sure, you all have seen that creates some opportunities. Johan has restructured the business last year in terms of the retail positioning and in the institutional positioning. The teams are in place now, they know where the money is, there know where the flows are. Of course, the open architecture within the SPF base has created some challenges in terms of the flows that go into other platforms, not just under the Sanlam platform. So we need to turn that on its head a little bit and get the flows on the other open platforms back into the semi-structured. Diversification of the asset base, that's important. New investment strategies around private equity, some Africa did and new things that come along. Africa is a big opportunity. We think both from money that's going to come in to Africa, we want to be there as the go-to investment destination. Investment has for the African money that's coming in, looking in for the opportunity as well as for the money that created and needs to be invested out of those countries. And of course, in South Africa, there has to be the retention of focus on the operating environment and transformation in this country is very important in the institutional space. So Johan and his team are continually on that transformation journey made a lot of progress there and also on the people development. \r\nOn the Santam side, this one I can speak a little bit about not fairly well. I've always said that any fool can sell a $2 ice cream for $1 and some people in the short term industry are quite good at that. I think Sanlam over a period of time -- Santam has demonstrated that it knows how to balance this issue of growth and profit. And to achieve the growth if you strip out the sell business to achieve 12% for the 20 -- almost a 25% market share in these tough times is an incredible achievement, given that the margin also moved up well above the top end of the target range. So business is in good shape, far more diversified now. It's got a good -- very strong positioning in the traditional intermediated space and the Specialist space, it's got unique positioning moving that into Africa and they got the direct business, which has started with short-term insurance, now moving into the small business insurance and into the life and then that model as well. It won't be just the South African story, it will also be a story in Africa. And I think this move into Africa and India Southeast Asia on the Specialist business side is also very important. On the Santam side, it's a 3-legged stool, so the investment is made, then we moved the Specialist business in there and then we moved the reinsurance business in there as well. And you can see, if you strip out and if you look at the results of Santam, you'll see the significant increase in businesses has been sourced into the Santam group from the strategy from outside of South Africa. But of course, the focus has to remain on pricing accuracy, on managing the supply chain, on improving the risk management on the ground, in Specialist businesses, in particular, you've got to make sure that you're on the good risks and that you're not on the bad risks? Because if you're on the bad risks at the wrong rate, you can really get clobbered. And that can be seen as well. And that's why it's important to work with other stakeholders. \r\nWe’re pleased to see the new minister now taking control in Corporate Governance and Traditional Affairs. He is talking about the back-to-basic strategy. He is talking about pairing up the particularly distressed municipalities with the stronger ones. It was some of the political guys have jumped onto that. But we know from the discussions with the minister and the from the local government authorities, that there's a really need to move these very weak municipalities with the stronger ones. Fearing is very, very important. And it's a critical component for us in the Santam business, as you know, because the risk on the ground is influenced by storm water drainage systems and building protection systems and et cetera or all with come adherence to that. So those are really the priorities. Business -- the business is in good shape and the strategies are well-indoctrinated within the business [indiscernible] aligned around that. So I'll now hand back to Johan to take us through the outlook.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Ian. Not bad for 7 weeks -- 9 weeks, sorry. I missed the 2. It must have been the last 2 weeks. I have only one slide and I need to talk a little bit on the outlook and what we see. We don't expect a massively quick increase in the economic growth expectations in most regions. In fact, we believe that we are in for a tougher period with a lot of volatility and then particularly, commodity-based economies will struggle. People like ourselves. And, therefore, we have to set the business up to be able to deal with some of these headwinds in conjunction with what is happening in the economy, we've had tremendous investment market returns of the past 4, 5 years. And certainly, since 2009, well above the average. We think the ratings are becoming much more demanding. And from here forward, it will be quite tougher to, again, achieve those sort of returns. Therefore, we think we're in for a bit more volatility looking forward. And therefore, you know we're likely to decrease our exposure in terms of simple equity exposure. But a big part of our business is still based on average value of assets under management and things like that. And we think there will be some headwinds there, but we are preparing for that, and I think we're well-priced with a diversified base different countries and so to take quite a bit of this expected strength out of our results. A big focus is on the growth areas in the world. And that will -- 2 or 3 pockets in South Africa, but increasingly into Africa the emerging markets and then 2 or 3 niche areas also on the high end of what we're doing. In these cases, we still think in spite of the headwinds, we can grow our offshore base quite substantially by investing a bit more money as we have, but increasingly by growing our existing investments. We already have substantial, when you look at the group equity value of over ZAR 20 billion outside of South Africa. If we keep on growing this close to 30%, it will have a massive effect on carrying the whole of the Sanlam return towards a higher base. And I think we priced for that, but we see a lot of that happening. So there's been a big focus on rather getting to grow the business increasingly, the deal that we've done with Santam, taking a 35% equity stake in our General Insurance, a deal with getting our people from Sanlam Investments involved in growing our businesses into Africa. And so increasingly getting skin on the table and growing things, I think, will be a key part. \r\nAnd if I look at the challenge that Ian will have and his new team that he will set up in the next few years, it's in a way Sanlam-izing a lot of these investments that we've done in the past year, corporatizing them a bit more, getting more of our people in there so that we cannot only drive the relationship part of things but also the actual result to the excellence and levels of excellence that we're used to here in South Africa. \r\nThere's a number of investment opportunities under consideration. We know that, and we've been waiting for a long time to increase our stake in India. You would have seen our Indian partners are -- for the first times in their 40 years or so are cash fash[ph] through the injection of money into that business. So we'll be partnering them in the areas surrounding India. They have a lot of human capital, great people there and then expanding our Shriram base into some of the surrounding countries into Southeast Asia. I think that's a good strategy for us where we -- becoming thin on people. We've added close to 15 countries that we operate in the past 4, 5 years and from most South African companies would be a bit of a stretch coming from Bellville maybe more so, but we've done pretty well. We have this first mover advantage and is really capitalizing on that. \r\nAnd then the last word, ladies and gentlemen, is on regulatory change. We know it's part and parcel of where we operate, and we can't hide behind the fact that the South African economies will govern.  I mean we haven't fallen over in 2007, '08. We haven't massive failures of companies because of bad management and these kinds of things. But in spite of that, we have what is happening in the rest of the world, if you know citizens' brain for blood. And it reminds me of my friend, GT Ferreira, who often talks about save the brain for blood. He says a mule likes to talk much more about his mother, the horse, than his father, the donkey. So people only talk about the great things that they've achieved and so forth. In our own case, I think we have a solid thing. We have great things. In spite of that, we also have to look at the downside, which is what is happening elsewhere and have become part and parcel for the course. \r\nWe have SAM. Many of these initiatives that we've been talking about and planning for many years are now on us. From next year onwards, this is how we'll run the business. This year onwards, we have a dual SAM measurement and the old basis of looking at how we calculate Solvency and economic capital and so forth. And we're feeling our way towards that. We don't know yet. And therefore, on the capital side, we haven't been massively expansive on how we treat capital. We've been treating this, we think, very responsibly and conservatively. We have enough capital, but we're not going to run around and do stupid things now only a year later to say, \"Well, we need some of that capital back.\" It's a key part of how we operate. And the rest of the year will be used to sort that out. \r\nThe TCF regime, that has been with us for a while and that we've been battling with, particularly conflict of interest, the whole area about do we pay commissions, do we pay fees and a whole range of things. What sort of product do we have? Do we expand into savings even though we know at the lower end, for small amounts, there's no value to the client? But in South Africa, we need to save. It's an imperative. We've chosen, for a long time, not to go into areas where we can't clearly illustrate to the client this value. These are things that we have to look at. Now there are new opportunities. We got Treasury to agree that we need, at least on the lower end of the market, a product that is very tax friendly, low fees to really get the savings rate up, so we'll be pushing part of that. \r\nAnd then on the retail distribution review, which has been announced, we're in negotiations with the government. There's a lot of to-ing and fro-ing. They have a massive slew of regulations. We believe, from industry side, by focusing on 4 or 5 top things, like what we do business, we can achieve maybe about 90% of the result instead of trying to drown ourselves in regulation and so forth. I think we've made good progress on this. \r\nWithin Sanlam, we've already done a lot of work, and we've prepared ourselves over the past 5 years. We have a business in the U.K., where we can see what is coming our way. Therefore, nothing is new to us. It's simply the implementation thereof. But it takes time away from focusing on the future, and it gets a lot of our effort and focus and time focusing on the past. It is becoming more difficult to do business. We know that. But within this framework, it is not trying to outrun the lion. I think it's being faster than the competition, and we've done a lot of that work. I think we will sit and thinking about the opportunities really going forward. We have a solid base, many moving parts and a lot of option value in this moving forward. \r\nWith those few remarks, ladies and gentlemen, I want to end off that we're very proud of our results. I think the operational part is great but of additional new business trend that we've encountered because of the high growth levels but overall, a very solid result across the board. \r\nI would now like to invite a few people to come and help me with answering questions, Kobus Möller on our results, Andre Zeeman on the actuarial stuff and Ian on some of the general issues and maybe Santam. Please come and join me here in the front. And if you do have a question, ladies and gentlemen, just ask your name -- announce your name and fire away.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of the Investment Analysts Society in Southern Africa, we would like to thank at the outset, Sanlam, Dr. Johan van Zyl, members of the board, the executive for hosting us here today in the presentation of the results for the period ending December 2014.\r\nSanlam is one of the pillars of South African society. It is the custodian of people savings and of investments and in more recent years focused on capitalizing on the opportunities in the emerging markets of this world.\r\nSanlam was formed, came into being or just after the first World War in 1918. It is a mutual company and demutualized itself in 1998. It is -- today, it has a market capitalization of ZAR 160 billion. It is one of the top biggest companies in South Africa in terms of market capitalization, and employees just on 13,000 people, and it is the home for people savings and also for employment. As I said, there is full of society, and this is manifested in the share price, which has risen from some ZAR 6, some 12x to 13x over the past few years since listing. So Dr. van Zyl and to the members of the management, who will be addressing us this morning, once again, thank you, and we look forward to having greater insight into Sanlam as a company, as an enterprise the past, the present and the future.  Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nThank you so much for that kind introduction. It's always nice to be hosted by the Investment Analysts Society here in Johannesburg when we do announce our results. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Welcome. We will be talking a bit on what we've done in the last year, but before we start just a bit of welcome and I would like to welcome the Sanlam Chairman, Desmond Smith, the Chairman of our Audit and Risk Committee -- Audit Committee; Philip Rademeyer, number of executives that we have over here, Yegs Ramiah, [indiscernible], Themba Gamedze. I see Temba Mvusi here. Hubert Brody that's joined us recently from Imperial. And then, people will help me with the presentation, Ian Kirk, our CEO-Designate and presently the Deputy CEO of Sanlam; Kobus Möller, our Financial Director; and also Andre Zeeman, our Chief Actuary and Risk Officer.\r\nLadies and gentlemen, I'll be handling mainly the strategy and the operating environment. If we start off, then we will have Kobus Möller talking a bit about strategic delivery, and what has happened into the financial review. Priorities will be handled in the businesses by Ian and I will end off with 1 or 2 things that we plan to do in the rest of the year and issues that we have to look out for.\r\nIf we really look at the strategy, it is all about maximizing shareholder value. And we have a diagram that we really would like to drive in our own case returns on group equity value, which is the measure that we put forward. This is how we incentivized. This is how we measure ourselves. And in order to do that, we have a whole lot of strategic pillars within the business. We want to grow the business, operational efficiencies. Key part is capital optimization, diversification, transforming our business. And then, there's a whole lot of other strategic enablers like concentricity, doing the right thing, responsible -- products, a prosperous society.  These are the things that we focus on. If we really look at the key part of what we do. South Africa is still our home. It is a big part of what we do. We have a mature business here. So it's really about maximizing the return on the South African business. There is a lot of efficiencies and effectiveness issues that we have to do and that we have to drive out efficiencies, so it's about getting the return on our investment, a lot of it is mature. This is where we get the cash flow. This is where we get the dividend that we actually pay.\r\nAnd then through the process on the right, the capital management, drive out the surplus capital as old more capital policy -- or capital-intensive policies mature, using that capital, using some of the profit to apply to -- into higher growth areas, where we get higher returns, so it's really about that sourcing of new growth opportunities, making the investments and then growing those businesses and through both investment, but increasingly so also through organic growth, because our footprint is also quite big.\r\nAnd that is the story. It's been the story for a while. And we think there is quite a bit of it left. A few remarks on the operating environment. The environment is being fairly tough. Not the toughest that we've seen, but it is a difficult environment to operate in.\r\nThe business environment itself is characterized by weak global economy. It's not only low-growth rates in South Africa and unemployment that is driving things, but the pressure on the South African economy, I think, is very prevalent, and we also see it in our own numbers. Global demand has dropped off quite a bit, particularly for resources. We've seen in our own economy also substantial industrial action and we were impacted heavily by it.\r\nIn our Sanlam Sky business, for instance, we write quite a bit of our business in the platinum area. Rustenburg has been one of our major branches. And as we know, for full on 6 months last year, we sold way under what should have been done in that area, because of industrial action. Just as we got that right and got that going, we had low churning and other things that put pressure on how people see it and then their ability to save.\r\nAnd all of this, resulted in relatively low level of growth in the economy, but particularly so in disposable income with large segments of our particular retail client being under pressure.\r\nIn Africa, outside of South Africa, much more resilience despite pressure on income from resources, also in the oil-producing countries, but a lot of currency volatility, fortunately increasingly. We are about a basket of areas that we work in. It is about a portfolio of businesses. And in that lies an inherent stability. We focus on those areas, where there are opportunities and maybe close to that a little bit, where we have headwinds. And overall, the result is a very pleasing one.\r\nAnd India, growth is below the long-term potential, but massive optimism after the elections with share prices goes on doubling in the last few months or so. Investment markets, lots of volatility and lots of momentum investors and so forth, and particularly the value investors being hurt in many areas.\r\nLots of risk aversion in the market, and very difficult to get things right. But having said that a few numbers here, you can see the economy, the growth and so not doing very well. And in the long term, this is the picture that we have to play in about 70%, 75% of our business. This is the CAR that we've been built with. It is a tough one.  So increasingly, we're diversified. If you look at interest rates, a key part of our results and how things go forward. This is the 2 top lines there. The 9-year bond rate and the 5-year bond rate determine actually our discount rates for our middle market and our lower end of the market both of them.\r\nAnd if you really look at the top there, we've seen a 10 basis points lower discount rate that we're using for the middle and the affluent market, which has had a slightly positive effect and negative effect coming from the increase in the discount rate for the lower end of the market. The net value of new business impacting about 2% negatively by not so much. I think the absolute levels of the curve much more the point than the shape of where we're at. So new business margin because of those movements about 5 basis points down. But by and large, I think not much movement coming from interest rates.\r\nYou've seen a slight pickup in the short-term interest rates, which of course a 20 basis points tick up there, a slight tick up you can see in the lower end. The short-term interest rates, we have a lot of cash that we've invested at that rate, so our profit being slightly higher on that.\r\nIf we look at the equity markets, a major driver is that average Alsi up about 17% in the 2 years. We haven't had as great a year in 2014 as in the previous year. And this has resulted, of course, negatively on particularly our headline earnings, where we include a lot of our investment and Kobus will talk a bit about that.\r\nBut by and large, I think fairly pleasant picture on the bond side as well. On average, a higher base and because we didn't fizz in our asset management type business off the base, you would see the base was 17% up. We've done pretty well in those businesses.\r\nIf you really look at the exchange rates, increasingly as we move offshore, these things do impact us. The rand weakened about most of the pillar, against most of the developed currencies, where we operate. And you would see places like the U.K. and Europe having a bigger contribution to our profits, because the rand is weakened. That has helped us. In Botswana and India less so, but still a strengthening of those currencies relative to the rand. The rest of Africa, though, I spoke about currency volatility at the beginning, you can see we've been hurt by those currencies weakening against the rand by 3%.   Overall, the net result from financial services, our operating profit up 1.7% because of currency issues.\r\nNew business volumes up by about 1.4%, but value of new business coming mainly out of Africa down by 0.3%. So not too much, but overall a positive contribution coming from the currency valuation. \r\nIf we look at what's been achieved in the past year in the delivery, a key part of what we're driving [indiscernible], of course, the results. But we really look at the business quite carefully. We do a lot of investment into the business upfront, incur new business strength as long as that is positive, and which it makes our hurdle rate, so that we can get the profits into the future. We treat a lot of our business like that. It is all about capital, the management, the investment decision and so. Within that sort of a framework, our net operating profit per share increased by a very credible 26% over the past year. We're very just about that, normalized headline earnings a bit lower, mainly because the market didn't contribute as much in the past year, only about a 10% increase in the market as opposed to close to -- well, close to 20% increase in the previous period. So normalized headline earnings fairly flat. And in that, we incurred quite a bit of new business strength, because of the growth that you see below. New business volumes up 18% on how you know across the board, net funding flows up ZAR 42 billion. Those things don't mean as much. They're very positive and but you know an indication that things have gone well. They say nothing about margin. If we look about the margin stuff, our net life value of new business up 21%, up to ZAR 1.6 billion. And that of course, a big chunk of that incurs new business strength, particularly on the risk side, the EB side and so forth. This is where we had a negative impact because of the high growth on the actual profit that we've shown. But we will talk about that later when Kobus comes with his financial results. The margin is fairly flat on a per product basis maintained a bit of mix towards the higher or the lower yielding margins, more savings products in South Africa as opposed to risk and that sort of thing.\r\nGroup equity value, which is really a key part of what we try to drive. Group equity value at the end of December was of last year, ZAR $46.84 per share. We're pretty proud of what is being achieved there with a return on group equity value over the past year of 18.5%. On a normalized basis, that can help the market, which has been fairly flat about 18% return. This is how we measure ourselves. We have hurdles that we would like to achieve, and that is probably the main reason why we trade at the -- as the share price trade at substantially above the group embedded value. It is because our return is substantially more than simply the unwind of the discount rate.\r\nSo overall, if we look at the efficiencies in the business, the trick is not to only be bigger, but to be better. And the big part of it lies in growing the value of new business. I'm very happy to say that this has been a recurring story with about another 20% increase gross value of new business, 20% up over the period. In EB, we've had a very large single policy at a bit of a lower margin, overall, it decreased the margin a little bit. You would see that coming down. But on a per product basis, the margin very similar to the previous years, and increasingly you see the new territories that we've added and how it just makes a difference with the cherry on top. We're very proud of what is being achieved here. As I've said, of course, this incurs quite substantial new business trends on the risk in EB side, with EB's contribution being a major part of the growth there. And therefore, it's -- it impacted negatively on operating profit, despite of that still the 26% growth is very credible.\r\nQuality is key for us. We don't like to write business that will disappear before we made our money. You've see a slight uptick in 2013 in the second half from -- in lapses, surrenders fully paid ups. Mainly the Section 14 transfers, which is about administration, but we are also net gaining from a whole lot of that, which we don't show in the net number, but this is our book and the lapses as a percentage of book in the middle market. You can see after the strain that we've taken in the first half of the year a substantially better second half, also better than the second half of last year, and that is pretty good for us. And this goes to show a bit about the health of the South African consumer and our focus on different segments of the market. We feel happy with that. And overall, we don't see too many problems there for us. In the lower end of the market, persistency is a big issue. You've seen in the later half of 2013, industrial action, resulting and particularly that Rustenburg platinum area, in the later half of 2013, the beginning of 2014, with lapses ticking up a little bit, and have big chunk of that coming exactly from that. As soon as things started normalizing, we were able with [indiscernible] and the team there were doing a sterling job, getting things back to where we would like it to be and you see the persistency increasing there and lapses coming down a bit, so overall also a pretty pleasing story in terms of quality.\r\nAlways -- a slide on the experience variances and it's been a big part of the profit, where we simply do better on what assumptions are. Again, a number of sources of this. The big bulk of this experiences vary coming from risk, where we outperform in terms of what we assumed the assumptions to be, still well within that range of 3% and 4% of the value of enforce, but still a pleasing number at close to ZAR 1 billion of positive experience variances and of course, that help quite substantially in getting the return on group equity value up quite a bit.\r\nIf we look at our investment performance, I think we've had a very good year, a very sterling year. In fact, in a year where particularly, as I've said earlier, where value investors struggled. No clear direction in the market, difficult to fund opportunities, but I think our team [indiscernible] has done a sterling job. We've outperformed the benchmarks consistently by between about 100 and 200 basis points over the past 3 to 5 years rolling basis. And I think that puts us in a very good state. And a big part of our results is the shop window that is being created there under [indiscernible] to ship actually not only for the investment side of the business, but for a whole lot of our saving industry coming through SPF, personal loans businesses and so forth. So overall, I think a very credible number and something to be really proud of.\r\nWe're also in this business achieved quite a bit of -- on the profit side, achieved quite a bit of performance fees that Kobus, I'm sure, will allude to. The theme of diversification is key, not only in South Africa, but also in once we go beyond diversification on essentially for France. We used to be at middle market business only focusing on African business around 10, 15, 20 years ago. We've been able to diversify that middle market base. We've added the high end of the market through businesses in Malaysia, the mass affluent space, the high network space in Sanlam personal wealth, used to be Sanlam personal investments that we rebranded. In the lower end of the market through Sanlam sky, really expanding our business quite a bit on what we do and then the back end and the investment size and then going -- following our clients offshore in the high end and to niche areas in the developed markets, and into Africa, Southeast Asia, India, Malaysia and so in the middle market. So this is a key part. If we really look at our equity value, where our investments and value sit around 50% now in life business, down from about 80%, 10-odd years or so ago, a substantial contribution from general insurance, investment management, credit and banking, admin, health other stuff, surplus capital and so, so a much more, I think, robust and diversified base.\r\nAnd if we look at the profit that, that base generates to the right hand side there also much more diversified. Life being particularly profitable, once you've added the African businesses on to that. General insurance doing well. Investment management across the board carrying a bit more than its fair share of credit and banking, while only being 9% of our investment contributing roughly about 14% of our profit. So we're in the -- must be in some of the sweet spots in that area, so overall much more diversified.\r\nAnd if you look at that picture of diversification geographic stuff, every year we're strengthening that. We're into 10 African countries now, actually 11 by adding Mozambique there. We're into India and Malaysia, places where they speak English, the emerging market side. In the developed markets areas, we're into U.K., Ireland, Switzerland and we have now presence in Australia and U.S.A.\r\nAnd these businesses now contribute roughly about a quarter of our profit about 15% or 2/3 of it from the African base, the emerging markets base and about 1/3 of it from the developed market space, both of those businesses grew quite substantially on average close to 30%, but more importantly gave us a return of roughly 28%. So that's a big part of our business more than 25 doing very well. We'll see most of these places, they speak English, which means we can support them from Johannesburg.\r\nAnd although we maybe small in the countries we then can because of having a big base that we spread between the businesses, we spread that fixed cost investment, we can operate as if we're big in those places with the support coming from South Africa, following a partnership approach where we have great partners in those countries.\r\nSo overall, we're very happy with that approach. It provides opportunities to increase our investments to broaden our footprint and so forth. So overall, I think, a pleasing -- having been at that for quite further a while, I think Johan [indiscernible] have done a great job in creating footprint with many moving parts, where we have optionality into the future. And if you really look at how the businesses is growing from a traditional South African base 10 years or so ago to 1 that is much more diversified, where the traditional base still is important. We've added some new business into that traditional base like credit and so. So about 40% of what we use to have 10 years ago, still doing well, 60% of profits coming from new areas that we've added to that.\r\nThe entry-level market, Namibia, our emerging spaces, the rest of Africa, other international so doing fairly well.\r\nAnd if we really look the contribution to net operating profit over that time, not only have we've been able to grow the size of the pie, but also the composition. And this is the key part of it. We are now have many moving part, we have optionality as I have said, and it's a really -- I think a great story if you look at the progression. And into the future, it provides lots of optionality. You can now partner and focus on the area with potential, wait a little bit if there are headwinds in other areas and drive the things forward.\r\nThe overall picture is as you see in terms of investments on the right-hand side of the picture there, we now have 23% of our investments offshore, but they give us or gave us 26% of our profit on the left-hand side.\r\nAnd in terms of life, the future and so forth, you can see a pretty picture, a big chunk of it is offshore. Of course, a big part of our investments into Africa and India and so forth, not on the life side, but a big part of it is in general insurance side and also in credit and banking, and overall those complexes doing very well for us.\r\nCapital efficiency, a key theme over the past 10, 12 years. We've redeployed close to ZAR 30 billion over the past 8 to 10 years into buying back shares into your, first of all, selling our stake in APSA, then using that money wisely and buying back shares when we were underpriced.\r\nBuying businesses like African Life, building other businesses of that base, going into Africa, into the U.K., we have returns of well over 20% from those investments. So overall, it's done very well for us. In the past year, net basis ZAR 1.9 billion invested, we've done deals of around ZAR 3 billion, ZAR 3.2 billion. We sold some businesses in the U.K. And in India, reinvested that money elsewhere, so ZAR 1.9 billion on net basis invested. We realized another ZAR 930 billion from our operations, mainly returns on surplus cash, also a small part of dividends that we didn't pay out, the cash dividend added to that part of that ZAR 930 billion. We also got ZAR 185 billion from selling part of our stake in emerging markets, where we have short-term insurance exposure to Santam. They own now 35% of that. It's key that they support us there through their expertise, but also by having skin on the -- in the game.\r\nSo a key part of that and then discretionary capital at the year end, up about ZAR 3.3 billion, substantially allocated for acquisitions. Having just a word or 2 on that, we have quite a big pipeline. This is what -- how we came to that. We have quite big pipeline for that ZAR 3.3 billion. We already announced towards the end of last year, ZAR 700-odd million due with buying a small -- 30-odd percent stake into mid scheme [ph]. There's a big movement in India towards lifting the FDI limit of 26% in insurance to 49%. All indications are -- is that the rules it's already been announced. It's been through decree by the pause that be in India. They're now sorting out the rules. We think that should be done in the next month or so. And to take up our additional option of going to 49 there and the insurance companies will be another ZAR 600 million, ZAR 700 million. And then we have a whole lot of smaller bolt-on type transactions, both in South Africa, but also in -- particularly Africa and elsewhere, and that will take, in my mind, the bulk of what we have available.\r\nHopefully, we will add again during the year to this number. So -- but a pretty picture. I think with that sort of a basic story, very similar to what we've been talking about over the last 5 years, another step I think towards realizing our objectives, I would like to hand over to Kobus Möller, our Financial Director to talk a bit about the numbers. Kobus?\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nThank you, Johan. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We start off with just -- quickly on presentation and assumptions. I think we were fortunate this year that we didn't have any major IFRS changes or changes in our basis of presentation, so you'll find it very similar to last year, the comparison.\r\nAnd similar with our changes in long risk contracts in the long rate, as Johan already indicated, just a 10% -- 10 basis point change in the 9-year yield and 20 basis points up in the 5-year yield, so the discount rate for Sanlam Life 10.6% and 10.1% for Sanlam Sky. And we made some of the adjustments to our value discount rate that we applied for the valuation of our unlisted investments we used discounted cash flow, so very similar to last year in terms of valuations.\r\nYou've seen some of these numbers, equity value of ZAR 47 this year, return of 18.5% on that.\r\nAll our business remained well capitalized, Sanlam Life the CAR cover ZAR 4.5 million similar to last year. And then operating profit increased of 26% on this year basis, and our normalized headline earnings 3% up. On the back of those earnings, the board declared -- started declaring dividend of two hundred twenty five cents a share, which is 12.5% up on last year. And I think it's line with the policy that we -- as we followed a smooth growth in dividend based on the available cash earnings of the underlying businesses. So more or less following the same level of cover of cash earnings that we followed in the past. Life business growth of 33% and also very good net fund flows and life business value of no business, up 20%, 21%. \r\nThe next few slides, I'm just going to cover some of the highlights of the individual businesses starting with Sanlam Personal Finance, very good growth in the insurance business overall segment 14% growth, and Sanlam Sky that is the one area that we had the downside of the platinum strikes earlier in the year, which impacted on particular our agency force and the sales in that environment. I think the pleasing part of the result is that we carried throughout the year, overall, we had a 14% growth in our agency force for sales,  and it's actually 18% up in the last half of the year. So a good recovery in that environment. The negative thing was that we had some less sales -- group life sales. It's more chunky business, so that was down about 30%, essentially contributing to that minus 2% for the year. \r\nIndividual life business that's very well similar story than before, very good single premiums, good RA sales, somewhat negative performance from our risk business, minus 3% that negatively impact on the overall growth, but still very good growth overall in the individual life. Glacier that -- well, again, good flows on to your platform there, was finished 27% growth and you can also see that in the net flows of almost 20 billion ramped at SPF achieved, a big part of that actually in Glacier. A big part of that being new investment flows on to our administration platform. The value of new business in SPF followed more or less the trend of the life business flows. So you can see that increase of 10% in the value of new business with Sanlam Sky similar to last year, essentially because of the level of sales on the group site. The individual life, 14% increase. And the margins are more or less similar to last year, as Johan also said, on a by product basis, and essentially the same. And the only reason for that slight drop in the overall margins is the higher growth in Glacier, where the margins are slightly lower than the rest of the business. \r\nOverall, it's still about 3%, 3.1% average margin that we have achieved and have expressed that on a comparable interest basis, it's very similar. The profit contribution from SPF, I think that is one of the highlights for the year, it's exceptionally good performance to increase the profit contribution to less than ZAR 3.5 billion, 19% in a relatively mature business. I think the 2 areas that certainly help them in that is the higher asset base, so the unfees particularly, in the individual life, on the book -- huge in-force book that we have and also in Glacier we earn fees on the in-force book that had a big impact -- positive impact on the earnings contribution and then also Sanlam Sky and individual life both had a very good underwriting performance, particularly with valid the experience, very good investment in the period, contributing to the 25% or 19% increases that we've seen there. \r\nPersonal loans, the profitability of that book remains intact, 4% growth is really a result of us getting back on the growth in the book. So no issues with the profitability, but we didn't grow the book by that much. I think the book is now close to ZAR 4 billion from about ZAR 3.6 billion a year ago. \r\nThe cluster -- yes, we have clustered yield a return of almost 18% on equity value for the year, again, well above the target that we set for them. And if you compare that with a similar or even a higher return in 2013, a very good 2 years, actually for the SPF cluster. \r\nEmerging markets that dwell on the volume side, 27% growth in insurance business that includes both life insurance and general insurance. The life insurance business up by about 15%, Botswana and particularly, it's very well on the annuity side -- annuity business we have done, and Rest of Africa and India and Malaysia reflect some of the acquisitions that we've made in the last year, in particular the phasing in of the contribution of some of the general insurance businesses, but overall very good flows that we've experienced across the border from our businesses and you can also see that in the net fund flows plus ZAR 4 billion in net fund flows that those businesses have achieved. \r\nValue of new business follow the growth in the new life business, 18% increase in the margins are also more or less the same as last year, also a bit of a mix to change the average is likely higher but it's still a very good margin that we make in the business in Africa in particular. The profit contribution of selling emerging markets, ZAR 1.2 billion on a net basis, up 23% on last year. Again, that's a combination of growth of the existing businesses. The organic growth which was about 16%. On top of that is the contribution made by the acquisitions that we have made over time. In particular India, Malaysia, [indiscernible] where we bought indirect interest in Bank Windhoek that made the contributions of it. Botswana had a very good year, but in general, I think across the board our businesses performed very well, we had 1 or 2 areas like in Ghana where the currency made a negative impact on the results. We didn't perform that well, but we're quite happy, I think, with the overall performance of all our businesses in this last -- and as I said, this is now making substantial contributions on our results already, the ZAR 1.2 billion. And the return that we achieved on that cluster, 28% return in the value of the businesses there, the equity value and are operating ZAR 15 billion, becoming quite a sizable part of our business and relative -- and last year, we had a 30% return. This year, 28% return. So you can see that we actually achieved quite a big return on our investment in that businesses, which we are very happy. Sanlam Investments, the net investment flows of ZAR 4 billion for the year, which is quite a credible performance if you take into account that we've actually lost about ZAR 10 billion of PRC flows in the year and in wealth management that also lost about ZAR 2.5 billion of very low margin business that we have done for [indiscernible] companies. And to achieve a ZAR 4 billion net flows in that environment, I thinks it's excellent performance. New insurance business have the benefit of about -- the ZAR 8 billion single premium that is annuity business that we've sold in the year, that obviously, helped that -- the numbers there, or the 90% increase there. And that is also reflected in the value of new business, more than doubled and a big part of that increase is actually due to the single premium business -- the single premium policy that we sold during the year. \r\nThe operating profit contribution from the investment cluster, up 13% to just up below ZAR 1.5 billion. The investment business looked very well. I think they are the benefit of a higher base but as Johan also indicated that the investment performance resulted in quite a nice performance fees. I think maybe the one highlight is that even without the performance fees, the properties still up by about 20% and so the performance certainly helped -- get the higher base, but the underlying business is also doing very well. The employee benefits had a 16% drop in profit and that's the one area where we actually incurred the new business trailing on the big policy that we wrote. We had the benefit this year to have some modeling adjustments that we've made, so we could release some results. So the net effect on the profit is only about ZAR 137 million negative, if you take those 2, both the new business [indiscernible]. So without the employee benefits, profit would have been about 30% higher, which is a better reflection of the actual performance in that business, in particular, on the risk side, they have a very, very good year since it's distorted by the new business claim that we have to be incurred. The capital management, the 12% growth in net profit for the year. And the cluster in total yield of the return of 30%, again, well above our hurdle. And the positive side is that both the covered business and the non-covered business both yielded an excess of 20% returns. \r\nSantam had a exceptional yield last year as you had seen in their results already, underwriting margin increasing from 2.8% to 8.7%. Each turnaround in the crop business, the agricultural business, but the overall business has actually performed very well, to contribute to that performance. And if you invested in a Sanlam share, our investment in Santam over the -- last year yielded a 19% return. So the overall picture in terms of business growth, 18% growth in new business flows, gross flows and maybe the one -- I just want to clarify, the emerging markets share were minus 5, that's essentially because we've sold the Capricorn Unit Trust business in Namibia last year. If you exclude that from the base, the increase there is less than 40% the real actual increase like-for-like. And overall, you'll see we've achieved good net flows in all our businesses, less than ZAR 42 billion for the year. \r\nThe value of new covered business up by 21%, net of minorities, so the Sanlam portion of that less than ZAR 1.6 billion as we've seen good contributions from all our businesses, and obviously, they're not substantial jump in the Employee Benefits and this is for the year. For the margins remaining always similar to the year ago. Our overall net operating profit increased 27%, again all businesses contributing to that with this -- I mean the standard performance for the year being at of Santam each recovery and the contribution for the year. And our income statement, Johan already alluded to that, that investment returns down 40% in the -- that's the investment returns on our shareholders funds, that's really just a factor of the lower equity returns and also in 2013, we have the benefit of the depreciating rand in our international assets, which then took the same extent in this year. So lower returns are still within our normal assumptions and therefore, the investment returns is much lower than last year, and therefore, the drop in the investment return number and that contributed to the [indiscernible] earnings being down only by 3%. \r\nOur total Group Equity Value, the contribution or the composition of that. In total, less than ZAR 96 billion now and you can see the major contributors, the biggest tool being personal finance, but an increasing contribution now from emerging markets, almost ZAR 15 billion, as I said, and within investments about ZAR 6 billion of the ZAR 20 billion is International assets. So the international component of our equity value is now above ZAR 20 billion and you can see the ROTV [ph] that those individual businesses yielded for the year, all above the hurdles that we've set, all above 17%, 18% and the international component of that yield is about a 27% return. So a very good performance and we are very pleased off in terms of international contribution, but also our local South African business is doing very well. \r\nSince 18.5% return, and if you normalize that for the market, it's about 18%. And just looking at the different components in the build up of the group equity value earnings, starting with the covered business, the value of new business, the ZAR 1.6 billion on our existing in-force book, growth of earnings of ZAR 4.9 billion, including ZAR 991 million, almost ZAR 1 billion of experience variances -- positive experience variances, bulk of that would be part of that being mortality experience, good mortality experience in particular in the SPF side, but we have good experiences across our book. \r\nOperating assumptions changes at ZAR 522 million, part of that, but half of that is really capitalize some of the positive experiences, variances and then the other half would be more or less would be the modeling changes that I referred to earlier, we release some reserves. Our in-force book at the benefit of the higher equity markets -- the market that had another ZAR 550 million, and then in terms of our policy, we actually don't account for any goodwill in our GEV when we acquire life companies, so when we did the acquisition in Malaysia, in CIS, we most likely more than embedded values so we write off the goodwill in our GEV calculations. So that's from the bulk of ZAR 168 million is that. So if you add to the return of the net worth, the ZAR 1.3 billion, it's about ZAR 8.2 billion return on our covered business and that's about 19% return for the year. And we had a similar return of approximately 19% on our non-life businesses of about ZAR 7.3 billion to get to the ZAR 15.6 billion, overall. And on the right hand side, you can actually see the adjustments that we made to get to our normalized return, which is very similar to the return -- the normal return for the year. \r\nSo just last slide, in summary, I think in my view the results will show that we are on track to deliver on our strategy. I think we still add shareholder value by RoGEV returns, we had some strong profitable growth, and I think the pleasing part is that most of our businesses make strong contributions to the growth, 22% growth in VNB, operating profits growth and the diversification continues to add to our performance with our investment in the growth markets and as you also would have seen the bulk of our investments -- our capital investments in the past year, according to those growth markets and that will also continue to be the trend that we will look at as growth markets for the application of the ZAR 3.3 billion. With that, I'll hand you over to Ian to talk about the priorities for 2015.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Ian Kirk (Executives)】\nKobus, thank you. Let me start by saying thank you to many of you in the room for the good wishes that you've sent me. Thank you, also for some of the suggestions that you've sent me. I greatly appreciate it. It's sort of privilege and honor for me to leave the group through the next stage of its development and a lot to do and that's very exciting, including the centenary year. So just before I get into the priorities, just a couple of comments. Number one is, I'm 9 weeks in the business. So please don't expect me to have all the answers. I've been, obviously, associated with the group since 2006, but I'm going through this transition phase. It's been well-structured by the board and by Johan and Johan is with us for the rest of the year, and I'm getting into it on an appropriate basis. One of the biggest mistakes, I think, I could make in this job is to assume I know stuff because I've been in the industry for long and I have been associated with the group. So this is a very important process of hand over. \r\nAnd second thing is, the business is in good shape, you can see from the results over a period of time, strategy is well set, it's being well-executed, there are no burning platforms. There are challenges, there's no doubt, there are challenges, mainly the external challenges, Johan is going to talk about it upfront, he's going to talk a bit about the end and of course, the challenges associated with the base. But the business is in good shape, so there's no dramatic need to get stuck and make changes. The other important point, I think, I'd like to make upfront is that don't assume a new CE equates to a new strategy. I've been involved with this, it does happen, it can happen, it has happened in financial services, it won't necessarily happen with someone to make that point upfront. Whatever happens we'll evolve over time, it will be a team effort. And just with regard to that, just to mention Hubert. Hubert joined us from Imperial 1st of January, so he is also a 9-weeker like myself. And his experience in banking and then subsequently the Investment Banking. Johan and I are not directing Hubert in a particular direction, but obviously, he is looking at the capital, he is looking for the strategy, and we'll hear from him next month as we go forward. \r\nOkay. So just to word about the priorities for these businesses as we go forward. The SPF business has done really well. You'll the results on the risk side in the year that's sold. So profitable business over a period of time. But we do see some opportunities to get the volumes up in that regard and some new players have come into the market with some new ideas and some new changes. The team have been busy towards the end of last year and have come up with some new ways of doing the business. So we think in the risk business we can do better. On the Sky side, we've predominantly filling the funeral business. We're resisted selling savings plans into that and the back of the TCF guidance and also the fundamental principle of Sanlam that we need offer value to customers in the savings products, some of the competitors have not done that. We think some new opportunity is there around techview[ph] savings and some other things that we've come up with. \r\nSo I think we'll be expanding that product range and as well as the bit distribution footprint. We are strong in certain areas. We have some opportunities in other geographies in the country. On the Glacier side, there's a new opportunities around savings products on the international side as well, and we can sell some more risk business into that base, on the Glacier side. MiWay is a different venture, as you all know, it's been done by others in South Africa and around the world. MiWay now has short-term insurance base of around 250,000 plans, which is a great achievement over 7 or 8 years. But you'd be interested to know that on the dollar base is substantially more than that. In fact, many of you on the room here are probably on the dollar base. So there is a very huge dollar base, and now, we can use that base and the skill that's been set up. There will be a J curve on MiWay on the life side, but not a substantial as we were starting from scratch. So I think it's a nice opportunity there. That's a different segment. It's a different market, different lifestyle type experience, the direct. It won't be as in short-term, whether it will be the significant part of the retail market will be direct, but the number is growing. We've looked at this. We've looked at what the brokers are delivering. We've looked at what the agents are delivering and we looked at how that growth in directors is coming out. It will mirror less --  it's actually as an opportunity, for us through the intermediaries and also on the direct basis, the legislation is coming effective on March. So we're busy with that. We're not going to sleep. We've got our product range, in fact, I'm sure there are a few agents. If you go online, sanlam.co.za, you can start buying now some of the product. It takes few savings products and I think that's a nice opportunity for us. It's a big mature business. We'll need to continue to look at the operational efficiencies on the distribution side, on the network and on the operations side. \r\nAnd of course, regulatory form is significant. SAM, you will understand we've talked about that before TCF as well, the big one now for us, of course, is the retail distribution. Reveal those significant changes. We're positive with that. We've identified what we think needs to change. We think the regulator here will be responsible. We know what's happened in U.K. We know what's happened in Australia. We've seen that. They've also seen that. We're working through a scissor [ph]. So we think -- we trust, we hope if any other regulators are here, we trust that they will be responsible in how we deal with this issue. So we see some opportunities there, not just the downside. \r\nOn the Emerging Markets side, you've seen from Johan and from Kobus what's been achieved. It's fantastic. It really has been a great story, but that story is not over, we can -- So by deepening the relationships and the opportunities that arise, as Johan indicated about India and the legislation changes that opportunity we get a chance to live to equity, the same opportunity exists in Africa and obviously in Southeast Asia as well. And it's about deepening that product range, particularly on the asset management side, on the pension’s fund, et cetera. We're strong on the life side, we're strong on the general side in many of the countries, some of the general companies we need to lift a bit. And those are considerable opportunities. It will remain on Africa in the Southeast Asia for structural growth, no doubt. We're looking at Francophone and Lusophone, Mozambique is the first entry there. We tended to move off a bit, not get too active in that in the initial years because of the culture and because of language, et cetera, regulatory system a little bit and not the same as in English-speaking countries, but our team has got a bit more confidence there now. \r\nShriram was introducing the [indiscernible] investment into the Shriram group has created a lot of capital opportunity there as well, under -- so we will look with Shriram and some of the opportunities in Southeast Asia. And I think a very important thing that will take place over the next few years is how we will vest the Sanlam brand in the mind of consumers, the intermediaries. Who've got -- obviously, we also move into a pan African scenario and importantly, for the employees that have been part of the Sanlam group mean something different. So they're not just sitting in the subsidiary or in the associated company in Malawi that actually fill part and parcel. I'm not saying we're going to transition to a multinational that will become more of a -- certainly a pan-African play. And that is important, I think, for the clients, for the intermediates, and for us now. So that's a good story and then there's a lot to do there. \r\nOn the investment side, I mean, Johan said that time and time again, priority 1, priority 2 and priority 3 in this business is investment performance. Johan is taking you through some of the steps there as to where we position ourselves. That's been good and if it's not good, it's very, very difficult to sell. We've had that experience many years ago as well. So the focus will remain on that. Having said that, the refreshed brand now that's been done around the world switches [ph], I'm sure, you all have seen that creates some opportunities. Johan has restructured the business last year in terms of the retail positioning and in the institutional positioning. The teams are in place now, they know where the money is, there know where the flows are. Of course, the open architecture within the SPF base has created some challenges in terms of the flows that go into other platforms, not just under the Sanlam platform. So we need to turn that on its head a little bit and get the flows on the other open platforms back into the semi-structured. Diversification of the asset base, that's important. New investment strategies around private equity, some Africa did and new things that come along. Africa is a big opportunity. We think both from money that's going to come in to Africa, we want to be there as the go-to investment destination. Investment has for the African money that's coming in, looking in for the opportunity as well as for the money that created and needs to be invested out of those countries. And of course, in South Africa, there has to be the retention of focus on the operating environment and transformation in this country is very important in the institutional space. So Johan and his team are continually on that transformation journey made a lot of progress there and also on the people development. \r\nOn the Santam side, this one I can speak a little bit about not fairly well. I've always said that any fool can sell a $2 ice cream for $1 and some people in the short term industry are quite good at that. I think Sanlam over a period of time -- Santam has demonstrated that it knows how to balance this issue of growth and profit. And to achieve the growth if you strip out the sell business to achieve 12% for the 20 -- almost a 25% market share in these tough times is an incredible achievement, given that the margin also moved up well above the top end of the target range. So business is in good shape, far more diversified now. It's got a good -- very strong positioning in the traditional intermediated space and the Specialist space, it's got unique positioning moving that into Africa and they got the direct business, which has started with short-term insurance, now moving into the small business insurance and into the life and then that model as well. It won't be just the South African story, it will also be a story in Africa. And I think this move into Africa and India Southeast Asia on the Specialist business side is also very important. On the Santam side, it's a 3-legged stool, so the investment is made, then we moved the Specialist business in there and then we moved the reinsurance business in there as well. And you can see, if you strip out and if you look at the results of Santam, you'll see the significant increase in businesses has been sourced into the Santam group from the strategy from outside of South Africa. But of course, the focus has to remain on pricing accuracy, on managing the supply chain, on improving the risk management on the ground, in Specialist businesses, in particular, you've got to make sure that you're on the good risks and that you're not on the bad risks? Because if you're on the bad risks at the wrong rate, you can really get clobbered. And that can be seen as well. And that's why it's important to work with other stakeholders. \r\nWe’re pleased to see the new minister now taking control in Corporate Governance and Traditional Affairs. He is talking about the back-to-basic strategy. He is talking about pairing up the particularly distressed municipalities with the stronger ones. It was some of the political guys have jumped onto that. But we know from the discussions with the minister and the from the local government authorities, that there's a really need to move these very weak municipalities with the stronger ones. Fearing is very, very important. And it's a critical component for us in the Santam business, as you know, because the risk on the ground is influenced by storm water drainage systems and building protection systems and et cetera or all with come adherence to that. So those are really the priorities. Business -- the business is in good shape and the strategies are well-indoctrinated within the business [indiscernible] aligned around that. So I'll now hand back to Johan to take us through the outlook.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nThank you, Ian. Not bad for 7 weeks -- 9 weeks, sorry. I missed the 2. It must have been the last 2 weeks. I have only one slide and I need to talk a little bit on the outlook and what we see. We don't expect a massively quick increase in the economic growth expectations in most regions. In fact, we believe that we are in for a tougher period with a lot of volatility and then particularly, commodity-based economies will struggle. People like ourselves. And, therefore, we have to set the business up to be able to deal with some of these headwinds in conjunction with what is happening in the economy, we've had tremendous investment market returns of the past 4, 5 years. And certainly, since 2009, well above the average. We think the ratings are becoming much more demanding. And from here forward, it will be quite tougher to, again, achieve those sort of returns. Therefore, we think we're in for a bit more volatility looking forward. And therefore, you know we're likely to decrease our exposure in terms of simple equity exposure. But a big part of our business is still based on average value of assets under management and things like that. And we think there will be some headwinds there, but we are preparing for that, and I think we're well-priced with a diversified base different countries and so to take quite a bit of this expected strength out of our results. A big focus is on the growth areas in the world. And that will -- 2 or 3 pockets in South Africa, but increasingly into Africa the emerging markets and then 2 or 3 niche areas also on the high end of what we're doing. In these cases, we still think in spite of the headwinds, we can grow our offshore base quite substantially by investing a bit more money as we have, but increasingly by growing our existing investments. We already have substantial, when you look at the group equity value of over ZAR 20 billion outside of South Africa. If we keep on growing this close to 30%, it will have a massive effect on carrying the whole of the Sanlam return towards a higher base. And I think we priced for that, but we see a lot of that happening. So there's been a big focus on rather getting to grow the business increasingly, the deal that we've done with Santam, taking a 35% equity stake in our General Insurance, a deal with getting our people from Sanlam Investments involved in growing our businesses into Africa. And so increasingly getting skin on the table and growing things, I think, will be a key part. \r\nAnd if I look at the challenge that Ian will have and his new team that he will set up in the next few years, it's in a way Sanlam-izing a lot of these investments that we've done in the past year, corporatizing them a bit more, getting more of our people in there so that we cannot only drive the relationship part of things but also the actual result to the excellence and levels of excellence that we're used to here in South Africa. \r\nThere's a number of investment opportunities under consideration. We know that, and we've been waiting for a long time to increase our stake in India. You would have seen our Indian partners are -- for the first times in their 40 years or so are cash fash[ph] through the injection of money into that business. So we'll be partnering them in the areas surrounding India. They have a lot of human capital, great people there and then expanding our Shriram base into some of the surrounding countries into Southeast Asia. I think that's a good strategy for us where we -- becoming thin on people. We've added close to 15 countries that we operate in the past 4, 5 years and from most South African companies would be a bit of a stretch coming from Bellville maybe more so, but we've done pretty well. We have this first mover advantage and is really capitalizing on that. \r\nAnd then the last word, ladies and gentlemen, is on regulatory change. We know it's part and parcel of where we operate, and we can't hide behind the fact that the South African economies will govern.  I mean we haven't fallen over in 2007, '08. We haven't massive failures of companies because of bad management and these kinds of things. But in spite of that, we have what is happening in the rest of the world, if you know citizens' brain for blood. And it reminds me of my friend, GT Ferreira, who often talks about save the brain for blood. He says a mule likes to talk much more about his mother, the horse, than his father, the donkey. So people only talk about the great things that they've achieved and so forth. In our own case, I think we have a solid thing. We have great things. In spite of that, we also have to look at the downside, which is what is happening elsewhere and have become part and parcel for the course. \r\nWe have SAM. Many of these initiatives that we've been talking about and planning for many years are now on us. From next year onwards, this is how we'll run the business. This year onwards, we have a dual SAM measurement and the old basis of looking at how we calculate Solvency and economic capital and so forth. And we're feeling our way towards that. We don't know yet. And therefore, on the capital side, we haven't been massively expansive on how we treat capital. We've been treating this, we think, very responsibly and conservatively. We have enough capital, but we're not going to run around and do stupid things now only a year later to say, \"Well, we need some of that capital back.\" It's a key part of how we operate. And the rest of the year will be used to sort that out. \r\nThe TCF regime, that has been with us for a while and that we've been battling with, particularly conflict of interest, the whole area about do we pay commissions, do we pay fees and a whole range of things. What sort of product do we have? Do we expand into savings even though we know at the lower end, for small amounts, there's no value to the client? But in South Africa, we need to save. It's an imperative. We've chosen, for a long time, not to go into areas where we can't clearly illustrate to the client this value. These are things that we have to look at. Now there are new opportunities. We got Treasury to agree that we need, at least on the lower end of the market, a product that is very tax friendly, low fees to really get the savings rate up, so we'll be pushing part of that. \r\nAnd then on the retail distribution review, which has been announced, we're in negotiations with the government. There's a lot of to-ing and fro-ing. They have a massive slew of regulations. We believe, from industry side, by focusing on 4 or 5 top things, like what we do business, we can achieve maybe about 90% of the result instead of trying to drown ourselves in regulation and so forth. I think we've made good progress on this. \r\nWithin Sanlam, we've already done a lot of work, and we've prepared ourselves over the past 5 years. We have a business in the U.K., where we can see what is coming our way. Therefore, nothing is new to us. It's simply the implementation thereof. But it takes time away from focusing on the future, and it gets a lot of our effort and focus and time focusing on the past. It is becoming more difficult to do business. We know that. But within this framework, it is not trying to outrun the lion. I think it's being faster than the competition, and we've done a lot of that work. I think we will sit and thinking about the opportunities really going forward. We have a solid base, many moving parts and a lot of option value in this moving forward. \r\nWith those few remarks, ladies and gentlemen, I want to end off that we're very proud of our results. I think the operational part is great but of additional new business trend that we've encountered because of the high growth levels but overall, a very solid result across the board. \r\nI would now like to invite a few people to come and help me with answering questions, Kobus Möller on our results, Andre Zeeman on the actuarial stuff and Ian on some of the general issues and maybe Santam. Please come and join me here in the front. And if you do have a question, ladies and gentlemen, just ask your name -- announce your name and fire away.",
      "transcript_text3": "I see Larissa. I see other questions in. Larissa?\n\n---\n\nLarissa from Barclays. Two quick questions, please. The first one, Sanlam Sky announced a drop in volumes, as you explained, but the margin was actually up quite appreciably from -- it was 8.6% to 9.5%. Were there efficiency-related benefits? And can we expect more going forward? Or will the margin be volume driven going forward? The second question pertains to the Rest of Africa. You touched on some difficulty in economies, a lot of the economies being oil driven. Are you seeing a strain on the Life side? Or have Life sales this fall been disconnected from the ties of the GDP growth to the oil prices?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Kobus, you take the question.\n\n---\n\nAbout the margin one,  [indiscernible] so she can give you some more detail. But essentially, it's in the mix of business. The 18% or 14% growth in the agency force, but the group business is actually down by 50%. Our margin is actually lower in the retail part of the business, so that's just a change in the mix there.\n\n---\n\nOn the African side and what we see, there are 2 main drivers of the African opportunity. One is the relatively high growth rates, this is certainly where your question comes from, do we see with oil prices. And we see a bit more volatility. The oil prices and resources in general, commodities and generally impacting the exchange rates quite negatively, not massively relative to South Africa, so there has been a bit of a drag. But what is really driving the African opportunity is not so much the GDP in the shorter term but really, I think, the low level of penetration. If you think about relative to South Africa penetration as a percentage of GDP in terms of insurance, around 15%. In Africa, those numbers are closer to 1%. So there's a massive pent-up demand there, and that is not so much dependent on the GDP. So no, we don't see any thing in the short term about the growth rates and that sort of a thing having a negative effect on the consumer yet simply because so many of the consumers don't have the product yet. There's a question here if you can just get the mic in, please. It will be detailed, of course [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\nGrowth on sales, you stated that you were proud of your results. I can only say, once again, that you and your team deserve to be congratulated. The results certainly are sparkling. In your outlook, you mentioned briefly the expectations of investment returns into the future. And you certainly suggested that they may very well be  muted, although you didn't use those terms. With all the pluses that I see in the report, I found it somewhat disconcerting to see one line that had a statistic with brackets around it. Now I'm referring to the table on Page 9 and the net investment return, which shows a 41% decrease. Now I found the reasoning for that on the income statement, which is on Page -- which appears on Pages 24 and 25. And it's under the line Other Investments Surpluses, which shows that all the segments except corporate with a substantially reduced statistic from the year before, but I cannot find an explanation for that. So rather than get a long detailed story from me, would you care to give me the detailed story?\n\n---\n\nYes. The answer is really on the slide on Page 10. Last year, we had a 21% growth in the equity market returns. This year, it was only 10%. So although we still have positive returns on our investment returns, and investment returns that we show on that line is what we are own on our shareholder funds. So it's just a lower level of returns relative to last year. So it' 41% lower than last year, but it's still positive returns.\n\n---\n\nIs there math -- is there some arithmetic somewhere in the report? Because I can't find anything to explain how you arrived at the numbers.\n\n---\n\nWell, it should be roughly -- we've got about 17%, 18% in shareholder funds. And last year, we had a 20% return on that number, and this year, we have a 10% return on that number. And it's really the difference between the 2.\n\n---\n\nYes. The 10% is still more than the long-term expected return, but it's lower than the previous year. And this is where the base actually starts mattering or really matters. Results, unfortunately, if you look at the growth numbers and so forth, aren't only in the absolute sense. It's also relative to the previous year. So you have a high base -- an extraordinary high base of return that we can't -- we would love to have another 20% at the year, but that is the point. Already, we haven't had 1 last year. And going forward, we think it may be even more strained.\n\n---\n\nAnd this is despite the fact that 2014 in the marketplace was a good year for returns.\n\n---\n\nYes, it was good.\n\n---\n\nJust lesser than the year before.\n\n---\n\nBut lesser than the year before.\n\n---\n\nTo the extent as shown.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nYes, exactly that. It's a big number. And that shows to what an extent life insurance companies are actually influenced by markets. If you have positive effects in the markets and high returns, we do well. We have the wind from behind. Risto is there [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\nGregory [ph] from Marvel Douglas [ph]. Just 2 questions, if I may. Firstly, Botswana is quite a significant piece of your emerging market exposure. That's quite developed, I suppose. Just in terms of going forward, it will probably get smaller in significance giving capital deployment and relative growth rates. But are you finding it easy to sell business there on a savings basis and immunize those liabilities? That's question one, so just the growth in Botswana. And I wonder if you could just sort of discuss the high-level long-term rationalization for the investment into Medscheme. Is it going to be completely integrated in terms of an additional product to sell for your agents? Or is it going to sort of drive the employee benefits business? If we could just get some sort of high-level comments on that.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Botswana is high, and increasingly, we're selling a lot of annuities into that space. And in the past, we have had, once or twice, to stop sales because we couldn't find assets to balance those liabilities. We don't like to run risks outside of the country. We have additional balance with the South African base. There is not a 100% correlation between the puller on the rant [indiscernible]. And therefore, it's quite difficult in a relatively small country to find the right kind of assets. Would you like to add to that?\n\n---\n\nYes. So what do we do is we budget the sales on the assets that we can get. So if we can't get the assets, we can't do the sales.\n\n---\n\nWe can't do the sales. I think the second part of Botswana that overestimates its contribution in terms of our results comes through our exposure to  [indiscernible] is an excellent credit business, of which about half of the exposure in Botswana. But half in the growing component of it is in places like Namibia, Mozambique, Tanzania and so forth. And it comes up as -- because the holding company sits in Botswana. If the profits originate in Botswana, it actually comes from other areas. So it bloats the contribution from Botswana, but -- and you're right. In future, it is likely to -- it already is a bit smaller than what it appears. And in future, it will be a bit more smaller. The mixing Medscheme opportunity comes from -- the way we see it, it's sort of win-win between ourselves and Medscheme. All the open schemes -- and Medschemes is of course not a -- they have [indiscernible]. There's a whole range of other schemes that they do administer. Most of those schemes struggle to grow. And on our side, we have a big distribution force with no clear product set to really put. And if we can't make that marriage work for us, we keep our clients by selling them another very important part of what they require, a health product. Medscheme gets the distribution to continue to grow in a very competitive environment. And the manage is essentially made from this. Of course, we have the essential additional opportunity for us, is that it brings around 1.5 million lives, principal lives and a whole bigger number that when we start selling some of our products into that base, that is a big opportunity for us. And within that, we think it's a very good business. If we can make a hurdle from the investment by itself, we certainly think the synergies down the line and what it can bring them will drive that up to an investment of well over -- a return of well over 20% which, in South Africa, is tough to achieve on anything upscale scale very quickly. And this is where we are.\n\n---\n\nIt's Risto from Standard Bank. I assume this year, the dividend discussion of the Board was a bit more interesting than usual. I think you are fully aware that the consensus presentation was, I think, double the growth and dividend than what you had. Now looking at the numbers, I think the cash cover went up marginally from 1.1 to 1.2x. Secondly, the gap between the operating profits and the cash earnings seems to have widened a bit. So the question, really, is I mean how should I look at the Emerging Market earnings going forward? Because obviously, that's where the gap is opening up from. I mean should I just take the Emerging Markets earnings and assume some low percentage, like 20%, 10%, being distributable? Should I ignore it totally? How should I treat that?\n\n---\n\nYes. You have to look at the different countries. In some countries that are fairly mature, like Botswana and Namibia, you can expect a bigger number, but it's much more like Santam. We don't get the full operational profit as a dividend. We only get the declaration of a dividend. And so the cash component of what is being paid is relatively small, and you have to discount that even in the fairly mature countries. In the countries that's growing, we reinvest all of the profit into growth. That's our strategy, and that's what we would like to do. When you look at the cash, the cash available from operations, this is how we discuss the dividend. And it wasn't a long discussion, because the amount -- in spite of Santam having done very well, they didn't increase the dividend massively. So it wasn't a long discussion. The cash available, fairly limited and we take a longer-term view, expecting to grow that thing consistently. And so we thought it fairly prudent to -- within the pipeline, within whatever we're doing, to declare the dividend of what is still constantly a higher number.\n\n---\n\n[Question Inaudible]\n\n---\n\nNo, that is -- I think it was the high end.\n\n---\n\nYes. We set a range of 1.1%. So in time, it may come down. For the moment, we're comfortable at a 1.2% level.\n\n---\n\nMike Brown [ph] from ATP [ph]. Just leading on from that last question. And I'm not an expert on the accounts of companies such as yours. And obviously, within the Group Equity Value and the better values and flows that you used, it's quite hard to find a sort of simple cash flow statement. And how much capital have you guys really got sitting down unencumbered to help finance your expansion? I know you said that you often use the profits in the countries in which you are into to finance expansion. But if you're looking at the acquisition strategies that you might be pursuing, do you believe the group has sufficient capital to really make a big difference?\n\n---\n\nYes, we have. We have ZAR 3.3 billion. We've pulled it up on the capital slide and so forth. If we really squeeze things, there may be more. But we would be inopportune to do that now because we're changing the whole capital regime from one that we've been using for 20 years or longer to one that we will be using next year. And while we think we're adequately capitalized, we simply don't know, because it's a new way. And we don’t go into the new regime, which is risk based, for people to have less capital. I can guarantee you that. The idea from government and from the regulations is to have more capital. So let's cross that bridge when we get there. We don't know, by towards the middle and end of this year, how that thing will pan out, and then we will show you exactly where we are. At this moment in time, we're adequately -- don't expect too much. It is a new place. And we've seen across the world, in Solvency II, which is our SAM environment that people have to carry more capital. So the ZAR 3.3 billion is more than adequate, we think. The already existing exposure that we have offshore is about ZAR 15 billion in the Emerging Markets. The ZAR 3 billion will add us another 20%. That's a big chunk in 1 year. We don't want to run ahead for -- of ourselves. There's another question here, Brian at the back.\n\n---\n\nIt's Brian Mushonga from Crédit Suisse. We've seen a lot more players interested in acquiring assets in Africa and being prepared to pay eye-popping sort of prices. How has that affected your own expansion strategy in Africa? And is that why you're looking to Lusophone and Francophone countries now versus your strategy in the past?\n\n---\n\nAs in most of the Anglophone countries, we already have a footprint. We're very happy with the partners that we have. And we may have 1 or 2 blocks missing, like Investment management or maybe pension funds business or a General Insurance business or whatever, and we will still buy those things. But the big focus for us is really using and growing what we already have, and the big reason for that is simply because what has happened in the past 2 years. We've seen massive flows coming from private equity funds from some of our competitors into Africa, and prices are 4x booked, not being off the scale at all. In fact, that is, certainly in the past 6 months or so, become the norm. We struggle to see how you can make those things work, certainly in the next 20 years from that base, and yet, people rush in. And they want to be part of the African story, and they sell it to their clients and so forth. And therefore, I think we have a big first mover advantage and while everybody will be wondering what they've bought. Because often, those things that are available, we've looked at in the past 10 years, and some of them we wouldn't have touched at all and still, they go at 4x book. It tells you a story about a fool and his money.\n\n---\n\nOne more question, if I may. It's for Ian and Santam. Santam Re is obviously very exciting going in behind specialized business up in Africa. And how far along are you in terms of progress of making sure that you know what programs you are on and duplicating exposure? I know it takes a while to built those systems, get the data, but I suppose that's the success or failure of reinsure at the end of the day.\n\n---\n\nYes. I think we're making solid progress, Greg. We're not rushing. We're not rushing into it. We realize that this is a different market. It's a new market for us. We've been amazed with the amount of data and amount of modeling information that we have been able to get in a fairly short period of time. But we don't set them targets from the Santam side. They've gotten to decide what they can do. And if it's within the risk appetite, we will ride the business. You can see from looking at the numbers that it's progressing quite nicely. But building a reinsurance business, you don't want to rush the thing. It's going to take time. And we're talking 5 or 7 years' story. But I mean we're making very acceptable returns at the moment relative to the hurdle, and I think it's important to diversify within the overall Santam story.\n\n---\n\nAll right, ladies and gentlemen, we have 1 question on the webcast. Can you read it for us, please?\n\n---\n\nThe question comes from WJ Defris [ph] from Avia Capital Markets [ph]. He said, \"Your persistency levels have improved and have been on a downward trend since 2007. How can you improve these levels further? And what are your views on incentivizing policyholders to remain loyal?\"\n\n---\n\nWell, if you sell them the right product, they'll stay with you. If you sell -- so for us, the thing -- the whole issue about persistency is before you issue the policy, making sure that this client -- this is exactly what the client wants and so forth. And I think, we've said it many times, a big part in running that is the modeling. In banks, they have a credit scoring model before they give you credit. In our own case, we run the odds model that determines, by looking at how long have you been in a stable job, what's your income or your available income, would you be able to keep this policy on the books for a number of years and not to sell things that don't work. I think that is the critical thing, and that is how you manage it. A second part of it, and this was what anyone will tell you, is simply management information. Once a client is on the book, really keeping close to it, knowing when to run your debit run order, when to do the debit run. For some people, it's on the 15th of the month, for others, on the 21st and others, a day before the other people get paid. So these things are critical, but that means staying close to the client. And that information is where we've done a much better job than in the past. And clearly, we can always do better. We think the numbers where we are, relative of course to what we've assumed, is where we make great money. We can lift the hurdle a little bit but then lose a lot of business by not writing at that front. We think we're relatively close to the sweet spot. But it's always -- persistency is always the number that you keep relative to what you've assumed. That's where the really sweet spot is. It's not our persistency of 10%, losing 10% of our book relative to our peers, who may lose 15%. It is relative to what we assume we will have, and that will come through then in positive experiences variances and these kind of things. That is really the key. Andre, that's you're game as well.\n\n---\n\nYes. And of course, to keep the client, you need consistent good investment performance, good service and things like that as well.\n\n---\n\nYes, but that goes, to my mind, actually, without saying. People have a choice. And if you compare the companies in South Africa, a pretty competitive bunch. I would have liked for them to be useless, but they're not. They come with credible offerings and on the service side. And so you have to what -- the differences are essentially marginal between us. It's a bit like our rugby teams, marginal difference and often, the ref and the bounce of the ball that determines the outcome, not necessarily the player. \r\nLadies and gentlemen, any last questions? With that, thank you so much for the support. Like always, it's been a pleasure to share with you. I haven't said anything about our new building. It is brand new, and it's still a bit like -- it feels a bit like Kimberley coming here with a hole on the side here where they're putting up another building. But we really appreciate your coming up, and it's part of our drive to -- around our new brand that we've consolidated. We've consolidated a lot of our businesses in this building. We would like to increase our presence here in Harten [indiscernible] and Johannesburg in particular and then use this also as a base and as a very visible base into Africa where a lot of our African people. So thanks a lot for supporting us, and good luck.",
      "transcript_text4": "【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nI see Larissa. I see other questions in. Larissa?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Larissa van Deventer (Analysts)】\nLarissa from Barclays. Two quick questions, please. The first one, Sanlam Sky announced a drop in volumes, as you explained, but the margin was actually up quite appreciably from -- it was 8.6% to 9.5%. Were there efficiency-related benefits? And can we expect more going forward? Or will the margin be volume driven going forward? The second question pertains to the Rest of Africa. You touched on some difficulty in economies, a lot of the economies being oil driven. Are you seeing a strain on the Life side? Or have Life sales this fall been disconnected from the ties of the GDP growth to the oil prices?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nOkay. Kobus, you take the question.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nAbout the margin one,  [indiscernible] so she can give you some more detail. But essentially, it's in the mix of business. The 18% or 14% growth in the agency force, but the group business is actually down by 50%. Our margin is actually lower in the retail part of the business, so that's just a change in the mix there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nOn the African side and what we see, there are 2 main drivers of the African opportunity. One is the relatively high growth rates, this is certainly where your question comes from, do we see with oil prices. And we see a bit more volatility. The oil prices and resources in general, commodities and generally impacting the exchange rates quite negatively, not massively relative to South Africa, so there has been a bit of a drag. But what is really driving the African opportunity is not so much the GDP in the shorter term but really, I think, the low level of penetration. If you think about relative to South Africa penetration as a percentage of GDP in terms of insurance, around 15%. In Africa, those numbers are closer to 1%. So there's a massive pent-up demand there, and that is not so much dependent on the GDP. So no, we don't see any thing in the short term about the growth rates and that sort of a thing having a negative effect on the consumer yet simply because so many of the consumers don't have the product yet. There's a question here if you can just get the mic in, please. It will be detailed, of course [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nGrowth on sales, you stated that you were proud of your results. I can only say, once again, that you and your team deserve to be congratulated. The results certainly are sparkling. In your outlook, you mentioned briefly the expectations of investment returns into the future. And you certainly suggested that they may very well be  muted, although you didn't use those terms. With all the pluses that I see in the report, I found it somewhat disconcerting to see one line that had a statistic with brackets around it. Now I'm referring to the table on Page 9 and the net investment return, which shows a 41% decrease. Now I found the reasoning for that on the income statement, which is on Page -- which appears on Pages 24 and 25. And it's under the line Other Investments Surpluses, which shows that all the segments except corporate with a substantially reduced statistic from the year before, but I cannot find an explanation for that. So rather than get a long detailed story from me, would you care to give me the detailed story?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nYes. The answer is really on the slide on Page 10. Last year, we had a 21% growth in the equity market returns. This year, it was only 10%. So although we still have positive returns on our investment returns, and investment returns that we show on that line is what we are own on our shareholder funds. So it's just a lower level of returns relative to last year. So it' 41% lower than last year, but it's still positive returns.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nIs there math -- is there some arithmetic somewhere in the report? Because I can't find anything to explain how you arrived at the numbers.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nWell, it should be roughly -- we've got about 17%, 18% in shareholder funds. And last year, we had a 20% return on that number, and this year, we have a 10% return on that number. And it's really the difference between the 2.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nYes. The 10% is still more than the long-term expected return, but it's lower than the previous year. And this is where the base actually starts mattering or really matters. Results, unfortunately, if you look at the growth numbers and so forth, aren't only in the absolute sense. It's also relative to the previous year. So you have a high base -- an extraordinary high base of return that we can't -- we would love to have another 20% at the year, but that is the point. Already, we haven't had 1 last year. And going forward, we think it may be even more strained.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nAnd this is despite the fact that 2014 in the marketplace was a good year for returns.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nYes, it was good.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nJust lesser than the year before.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nBut lesser than the year before.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nTo the extent as shown.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nYes, exactly that. It's a big number. And that shows to what an extent life insurance companies are actually influenced by markets. If you have positive effects in the markets and high returns, we do well. We have the wind from behind. Risto is there [indiscernible].\n\n---\n\n【質問: Unknown Analyst (Analysts)】\nGregory [ph] from Marvel Douglas [ph]. Just 2 questions, if I may. Firstly, Botswana is quite a significant piece of your emerging market exposure. That's quite developed, I suppose. Just in terms of going forward, it will probably get smaller in significance giving capital deployment and relative growth rates. But are you finding it easy to sell business there on a savings basis and immunize those liabilities? That's question one, so just the growth in Botswana. And I wonder if you could just sort of discuss the high-level long-term rationalization for the investment into Medscheme. Is it going to be completely integrated in terms of an additional product to sell for your agents? Or is it going to sort of drive the employee benefits business? If we could just get some sort of high-level comments on that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nOkay. Botswana is high, and increasingly, we're selling a lot of annuities into that space. And in the past, we have had, once or twice, to stop sales because we couldn't find assets to balance those liabilities. We don't like to run risks outside of the country. We have additional balance with the South African base. There is not a 100% correlation between the puller on the rant [indiscernible]. And therefore, it's quite difficult in a relatively small country to find the right kind of assets. Would you like to add to that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Kobus Möller (Executives)】\nYes. So what do we do is we budget the sales on the assets that we can get. So if we can't get the assets, we can't do the sales.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Johan van Zyl (Executives)】\nWe can't do the sales. I think the second part of Botswana that overestimates its contribution in terms of our results comes through our exposure to  [indiscernible] is an excellent credit business, of which about half of the exposure in Botswana. But half in the growing component of it is in places like Namibia, Mozambique, Tanzania and so forth. And it comes up as -- because the holding company sits in Botswana. If the profits originate in Botswana, it actually comes from other areas. So it bloats the contribution from Botswana, but -- and you're right. In future, it is likely to -- it already is a bit smaller than what it appears. And in future, it will be a bit more smaller. The mixing Medscheme opportunity comes from -- the way we see it, it's sort of win-win between ourselves and Medscheme. All the open schemes -- and Medschemes is of course not a -- they have [indiscernible]. There's a whole range of other schemes that they do administer. Most of those schemes struggle to grow. And on our side, we have a big distribution force with no clear product set to really put. And if we can't make that marriage work for us, we keep our clients by selling them another very important part of what they require, a health product. Medscheme gets the distribution to continue to grow in a very competitive environment. And the manage is essentially made from this. Of course, we have the essential additional opportunity for us, is that it brings around 1.5 million lives, principal lives and a whole bigger number that when we start selling some of our products into that base, that is a big opportunity for us. And within that, we think it's a very good business. If we can make a hurdle from the investment by itself, we certainly think the synergies down the line and what it can bring them will drive that up to an investment of well over -- a return of well over 20% which, in South Africa, is tough to achieve on anything upscale scale very quickly. And this is where we are.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Risto Ketola (Analysts)】\nIt's Risto from Standard Bank. I assume this year, the dividend discussion of the Board was a bit more interesting than usual.

It is brand new, and it's still a bit like -- it feels a bit like Kimberley coming here with a hole on the side here where they're putting up another building. But we really appreciate your coming up, and it's part of our drive to -- around our new brand that we've consolidated. We've consolidated a lot of our businesses in this building. We would like to increase our presence here in Harten [indiscernible] and Johannesburg in particular and then use this also as a base and as a very visible base into Africa where a lot of our African people. So thanks a lot for supporting us, and good luck.",

I would also like to take the opportunity to welcome those who are viewing this conference via webcast. Together with Roland Iff, I am pleased to report to you about another very successful year for Geberit. Our presentation is structured as follows: First, I will give you an overview of 2014 and comment on sales development over the last year. Roland Iff will then present the financial results and thereafter, I will introduce the most important new products which we launched this year and give you an outlook of the construction industry and following a few comments regarding Sanitec, I will also comment on perspectives for Geberit in 2015. At the end, I will summarize and take your questions. \r\nIn 2014, the Geberit Group was able to further improve the already very solid results achieved in the previous year. Sales amounted to CHF 2.4 billion, corresponding to an increase of 6.4% in local currencies. The operating cash flow increased by 10.8%, reaching CHF 657 million, a new record level. With 27.3%, the EBITDA margin exceeded our midterm target corridor of 23% to 25%. The operating result also significantly increased by 13% to CHF 577 million. The EBIT margin reached 24.0%. The net income increased by 14.4% to CHF 499 million, corresponding to a margin of 20.7% of sales, also a new record level and first time above 20%. Earnings per share increased by 14.6% to CHF 13.28. At CHF 460 million, the free cash flow exceeded last year's excellent performance by roughly 4%. The Board of Directors proposes a distribution of CHF 8.30 per share to be distributed as a regular dividend. This corresponds to an increase of about 10%. Furthermore, the Board of Directors decided to resume the share buyback program started in 2014 and which was interrupted due to the Sanitec acquisition. \r\nLast year, we were once again able to introduce various new important products. Among others, we launched the Omega flushing systems with corresponding actuator plates. Omega flushing systems offer maximum flexibility, with 3 different system heights. In addition, the extra small actuator plates can be mounted at the front or at the top and provide an elegant, minimalistic design. In addition, we expanded in 2014 our Geberit Monolith family. We introduced WC module Monolith Plus with odor extraction directly from the toilet bowl orientation light and electronic flush activation. In China, we introduced a Monolith washbasin module developed specially for the middle class that is entirely produced in China. The module is available in 4 different options, with different ceramics and faucets. Further, we introduced new and revised Geberit wall draining system, slimmer in design and even easier and safer to install. As an example, for our regular extensions of our pipe and product portfolio, we introduced in 2014 the patent Geberit Sovent fitting. The Sovent fitting increases the flow performance by 40% and hence, enables relatively small-sized drainage stacks especially for high-rise buildings. \r\nLast year, Geberit invested roughly CHF 100 million or 4.4% of sales. This corresponds to an increase of 7.7% versus the previous year. Capacity expansion represented roughly 1/3 of the total investments. Over 40% of investments were dedicated to modernization and rationalizations and investment into new products accounted for 1/4 of the total investment. Let me now continue to highlight a few selected investment projects last year. We completed the newly built production facility in Ruse in Slovenia and started with production in July 2014. In Ruse, we produced fittings for our drainage piping systems, exposed cisterns and walls. The total investments amounted to EUR 60 million, which was in plan. A second key investment in 2014 was the expansion of our Italian production site in Villadose. In Villadose we produce our Geberit drainage pipes. The expansion addresses the volume growth in this important product line. The total investments amounted to EUR 12 million as we took up cap production in October 2014. \r\nAn important event in 2014 was the 50th anniversary of our concealed cistern. Since 1964, Geberit sold more than 60 million concealed cisterns. We celebrated the success with our customers on the occasion of various events. For example, with 5 VIP gala events across Europe that were attended by 3,800 customers. To address a broader customer base, we conducted 36 so-called construction site parties, with 8,500 customers, to strengthen our customer relationships and our brand reputation. \r\nIn addition to the 50th anniversary, we further invested into our customer relationships. As an example, the slide shows our customer activities 2014 in Germany. In total, we conducted 60,000 individual customer visits with our sales force. On top, more than 10,000 customers participated in 1 of our 200 events in Germany, addressing specific topics, for example, training on fire protection with live demonstrations or sales trainings together with AquaClean or new product demonstration with our on-tour events. \r\nLet me now comment on the development of our number of employees. Organic sales growth initiatives contributed to a slight increase of the headcount. Overall, the number of employees at the end of the year 2014 increased by 21 respectively, 0.3%, reaching 6,247 employees. Sales per employee increased to CHF 380,000, an increase of 3.5%. Roughly half of Geberit employees work in production, followed by nearly 1/3 in sales and marketing. Roughly 13% of our employees are active in administration or development, and we have a high number of apprentices which currently represent 4% of our employees. \r\nThe total environmental impact declined further by 1.6% despite the currency-adjusted sales growth of 6.4%. We also achieved a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption by 1%, respectively, 0.5%, versus the previous year, and our recycling rate increased further and reached 85%. In the context of our social engagement, we funded and carried out again a social project in 2014. Ten Geberit employees, paired with 8 apprentices, spent 2 weeks in Varanasi, in India, to renovate the sanitary infrastructure of Kiran Village. Koran Village is a school for 360 children, mostly handicapped. The project was planned, funded and carried out entirely by Geberit. \r\nLet me finish the review of 2014 with an overview of our investments over the last 5 years. The slide shows that we have -- that we follow a long-term investment strategy, with continuous investments in all key areas: into our infrastructure, in R&D and new products and in marketing. These continuous investments build the basis for our future value creation. Let me now comment our sales development 2014 in more detail. \r\nThe sales growth rate in local currencies of 6.4% corresponds to a sales increase of CHF 146 million. The negative currency effect of CHF 34 million or minus 1.5% lead to an overall sales increase by CHF 112 million or 4.9%. In the first half of 2014, sales increased at a higher pace compared to the second 6 months. The stronger growth in the first half of the year can be explained by the relatively weak sales in the first half of the previous year 2013 and the mild winter at the beginning of 2014. All global regions recorded a positive sales growth in local currencies. Europe grew by 5.9%, with positive growth rates in all countries and regions. Sales in America increased by 6.4% and in Middle East and Africa, we were growing by 21.2%. Far East/Pacific also recorded double-digit growth rate, with 12.8%. \r\nLet me now give you a few comments on the different countries and the market developments last year. We outperformed the market in Germany, which showed a higher growth in the first half of the year compared to the second half of the year. We outperformed the market in Switzerland, which was running at full capacity and achieved the growth rate of 6.6%. We generated a currency-adjusted growth rate of 4% in Benelux, where the construction industry is still in crisis. Lower growth rates were recorded in Italy due to a weak market environment. And although the Austrian market is declining since the second half of 2014, we increased sales over the entire year by 2.5%. The Central and Eastern European markets showed, in 2014, a mixed picture. Our sales were growing by 11.7%, driven by double-digit growth in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. In the Nordic region, we faced challenging markets and recorded a sales growth of 2.4%. In France, we achieved a sales growth of 3% despite an overall weak economy. We outperformed the already strong market in U.K., with a double-digit growth rate of nearly 20%. On the Iberian Peninsula, we achieved a slight growth in a stabilized market environment, which is still on historically very low level. In America, the residential sector further recovered. However, the most important sector for Geberit, the institutional sector, remained weak during 2014. In Far East/Pacific, we have seen a slowdown of residential markets in some of our key markets, for example, in China. However, we achieved a double-digit growth in China, India and also in Southeast Asia. The total region grew by 12.8% in local currencies. In Middle East/Africa, the region grew by 21.2%, with double-digit growth rates in the Gulf region as well as in South Africa. \r\nI come now to the sales growth per product area. Both product areas, Sanitary Systems and Piping Systems, grew to a similar extent. The Sanitary Systems generated sales growth of 5.1% to CHF 1.37 billion. Piping Systems exceeded sales of CHF 1 billion with a sales growth of 4.6% in Swiss francs. All product lines contributed to growth, with positive growth rates in local currencies. The product line with the highest sales levels, insulation systems, grew by 7.5%. Building drainage systems showed the strongest development, with almost double-digit growth. Roland Iff will now lead through the financial results 2014.\n\n---\n\nLadies and gentlemen, good morning. For 2014, the group, Geberit Group, can once again present very solid results. Many key figures show all-time high levels. And despite the challenging market conditions, sales development measured in local currency lies slightly above our midterm target corridor and profitability was improved again. I start my presentation with the overview of the most important key figures. Overall, sales increased from CHF 2.2916 billion to CHF 2.4044 billion, corresponding to 4.9% increase. In 2014, currency exchange rate had a negative impact on sales in Swiss francs again. Changes in exchange rate negatively influenced sales by CHF 34 million, which impacted sales growth by minus 1.5%. The 2 major currencies, euro and US dollars, both weakened about 1.3% over the period. The operating cash flows and operating results increased over-proportionally to sales. The net income and EPS also increased at double-digit rates, growing faster than sales. At CHF 498.6 million, the net income reached a margin of 20.7%. And with CHF 460 million, we were also able to again increase our free cash flow. \r\nIn 2014, the EBITDA margin increased by 140 basis points to 27.3%. In absolute terms, EBITDA grew by CHF 64.3 million or 10.8%. On the EBIT level, the increase was CHF 66.2 million or 13%. In the reporting period, the overall unfavorable currency development impacted the results only slightly negatively. \r\nIn the fourth quarter, profitability was improved as well. The previous-year EBITDA margin was exceeded by 1.3 percentage points. Coming to some of the individual cost elements. Due to a favorable volume and volume development and shift in our market mix, the customer bonus quota increased also in 2014 as it already did in 2013. Material cost, as a percentage of sales, decreased from 26.1% to 25.1%, also due to slightly lower raw material prices. After having seen rising purchasing prices in the third quarter, the trend turned again in the fourth quarter. An increase versus the previous year was also recorded in personnel expenses. The cost increase of 1.8% is slightly higher than the increase in workforce, which grew by 1.4% or 84 employees on average. At year end, as we already heard, the increase was then only 0.3%. Further additional cost resulted from tariff increases on average in the group, about 2%, lower pension related expenses had a certain compensating effect. The additional employees, due to the volume growth, were mainly recruited in the European sales and production companies. Marketing expenses were on the previous year's level. In total, other operating expenses increased by 2.8%, which is clearly under proportional to our sales growth. \r\nThe analysis of the EBIT margin development summarizes what I commented before. The volume increase resulted in a margin increase of 1.4%. In 2014, the product mix was neutral. The previously mentioned increase in operating expenses led to a negative impact of only minus 0.4%. The small currency movements did not have a material impact on margins. The overall net margin impact between sales and purchasing price development in 2014 was positive again, and more than compensated the negative impact from the increase in our sales deductions. All in all, EBIT margin increased by 1.7 percentage points versus previous year. \r\nNet income almost reached CHF 500 million with CHF 498.6 million, corresponding to an increase of 14.4% versus previous year. This, compared to the operating results over-proportional increase, is mainly attributable to a slightly lower tax rate and an improved financial result. The improvement in the financial result is due to foreign currency losses, which we incurred in 2013. And the slightly over-proportional EPS growth of 14.6% to CHF 13.28 is driven by the share buyback program started in Q2 2014. \r\nAt CHF 460.4 million, Geberit achieved a 3.6% higher free cash flow than in the previous year. Whereas net cash flow improved in line with the operating profitability, free cash flow growth was slowed down because of an increase in net working capital. This net working capital increased results from a planned inventory buildup to secure delivery performance for certain products. Net investments intangible assets were CHF 7.1 million above previous year, mainly due to the already mentioned production-related projects. Out of this free cash flow of CHF 460 million, a dividend of CHF 282 million was paid and we bought back shares over the second trading line in the amount of CHF 37 million. Corporate cash therefore increased by about CHF 140 million. \r\nAs of the end of 2014, the cash position in the balance sheet therefore increased to almost CHF 750 million. Net cash amounted to CHF 739.2 million. Last year's pension liabilities increased again significantly. The net increase of CHF 67.6 million is, on the one hand, due to lower interest rates which led to a higher DCF value for these liabilities. And the other hand, it is partly compensated by an again, improved capital coverage of the Swiss pension plans. In 2014, this major change does not have a P&L impact, as the net amount is charged to equity. But higher -- but the higher liability level will lead to higher pension cost in 2015. The equity ratio was therefore also reduced from 74.8% to 70.6%. The financing of the group, however, remains solid and we continue to have a basis for an attractive payout policy. \r\nBased on this solid financial situation, the Board of Directors is proposing to the Annual General Meeting a dividend of CHF 8.30 per share. This corresponds to an increase of about 10% versus prior year. On that basis, CHF 312.7 million will be distributed, corresponding to a payout ratio of 62.7%. The Annual General Meeting will be held on April 1, 2015. Subject to the approval by the Annual General Meeting, the share buyback -- sorry, the dividend will be paid out on April 9. In addition, the Board of Directors has decided to continue the share buyback program started in Q2 2014. On a second trading line and over a period of 2 years, we had announced that the time to buy back shares in the amount of 5% of the capital. The shares will be canceled thereafter. As we had to interrupt the program while the Sanitec transaction was ongoing, we only purchased 123,000 shares for a total of CHF 37.4 million so far under the program. This is only 6.5% of the total buyback volume announced at the time. With this, I would now like to hand it back to Christian Buhl.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Roland. I will now make a few comments on the key product introductions 2015. We will introduce in 2015 a new, premium shower toilet, the AquaClean Mera. You see the picture on the slide. The new Mera combines innovative technology, comfort and design. Smart comfort functions, such as an automatic WC lid, seat heating and an orientation light are combined with a rimless ceramic toilet bowl to ensure highest standards for cleanliness and hygiene. The market introduction of Mera will be in September this year. In the product area of Piping Systems, we will introduce a new hygiene flush system to avoid stagnating water in drinking water systems. The automated flushing ensures safety and highest quality of drinking water in all buildings, especially in public buildings like hotels, hospitals or schools. The hygiene flush can be easily operated with a Geberit app on standard mobile phones. Another important product introduction this year for drainage systems is the new shower channel CleanLine for floor even showers. From an end-user perspective, the Clean Line convinces[ph] with an elegant design and an easy and practical way of cleaning. The advantages for the installers are an easy and secure installation. \r\nEspecially for the developing markets in Europe, we will introduce new actuator plates, Delta. The actuator plates are designed for the middle mass market and are clearly differentiated to our premium segment with the Sigma actuator plate family. After the short tour through some of the new products, allow me now to comment on the outlook in the building industry for 2015.\r\nIn Europe, we expect no recovery and individual markets will develop again very differently. We are confident about positive market growth in Germany and in U.K. In Switzerland, the construction market is running on a high level. However, the impact of the new ForEx reality on the Swiss construction market remains unclear. We are still cautious about the Austrian market development. And we see a mixed picture in Central and Eastern Europe, with a positive development in Poland and mainly uncertain outlooks in the rest of the Eastern region. We expect no recovery in Netherlands, Belgium, Nordics, Spain and Portugal. And we foresee further declines of the markets in France and in Italy. \r\nFor North America, the recovery in the residential building sector has slowed down over the last 6 months. The outlook for the institutional sector remains uncertain, with the healthcare segment still declining, while the educational sector presents an unclear picture on a still historically low level. \r\nLet me now comment on the outlook for Asia. We foresee a further slowdown in the residential market in China. And we are generally positive about India and expect positive growth in this region. The markets in North and Southeast Asia are expected to remain rather flat, with the exceptions of Indonesia and the Philippines. For Australia, we expect generally a positive development of the building sector. \r\nIn the Middle East and Africa region, we see a continued positive growth trend for the Gulf region and we expect also positive market growth rates for South Africa. For the Northern African region and Near East, we are very critical due to the ongoing difficult political situations. \r\nLet me now give you an update on the Sanitec acquisition, which we closed on February 10. I will start with a short recap of the overall deal rationale. \r\nSanitec is the European leader in bathroom ceramics and complementary products. The bathroom ceramics product range includes toilets, wash basins, tanks, bidets, urinals, and ceramic shower trays and represents roughly 75% of Sanitec sales. The ceramics complementary products include bathroom furniture, bathtubs and shower solutions and are responsible for the remaining 25% of sales. The acquisition is a combination of 2 complementary businesses fitting to the European sanitary market. Geberit today is based on sanitary technology and focusing on technology products installed primarily behind the wall. Key decision-makers for us are professionals and qualified installers and planners. Our innovations drive plumbing standards and we build a strong B2B brand over the last decade. Sanitec, on the other hand, strength's is design, with its in front of the wall product portfolio for bathrooms. Hence, the key decision-makers and the influencers are end-users, architects, showrooms and retailers. Innovation in this category drives future bathroom trends. And Sanitec comprises a portfolio of long-standing local end-user brands across Europe. The acquisition of Sanitec is an expansion of our current strategy, based on our 4 pillars. We add the strategically relevant product portfolio of bathroom ceramics and complementary products. Thereby, we expand our focus from sanitary technology behind the wall to sanitary products and design in front of the wall. \r\nThe complementarity of the 2 businesses leads to a compelling acquisition rationale. First, with Sanitec, we will get better access to end-users and their influences, which is of increasing importance in markets where installers are a less-qualified and less-educated. Access to end-users is also key for our shower toilet business Geberit AquaClean. Second, we are able to leverage our combined position at our existing common customers, mostly wholesalers where we can add value. Thirdly, we will leverage the combined product portfolio to increase sales. For example, in projects across Europe. Fourth, with Sanitec, to get access to ceramics know-how and high-quality capacity, which is a key success factor for our shower toilet business, which we are growing in Europe. \r\nFifth, the acquisition is an expansion into a long-term attractive market segment of bathroom equipments. And last and finally, we will create, with this acquisition, the European leader in the sanitary products industry. And we'll remain and keep our strength -- strong position in Europe. The combined pro forma sales for 2014 -- sorry, the pro forma net sales for 2014 are CHF 2.9 billion. This is still based on a euro and Swiss franc of CHF 1.20. We will have 3 equally strong product areas: 40% will be Sanitary Systems; 30% are today's piping business; and 30% will be ceramics and complementary products. Central Europe remains the biggest region with 50% of sales; followed by South Europe with 14%; Nordics 11%; and Eastern Europe with 10%. \r\nWe will integrate the Sanitec organization by function into the Geberit Group. This means that the corporate and sales organization will be fully merged. The operational functions, with manufacturing, product management, logistics, will be complementary integrated into the Geberit Group. The integrated organization will allow us to capture sales and cost synergies of at least EUR 45 million in the midterm, with first synergy impact in 2016. The one-time integration costs will be on the level of the one-time synergy level. To address the increased importance of an integrated marketing and brand management behind the wall and in front of the wall, we expanded the Geberit Executive Board by the Marketing & Brands functions. I will now hand over to Roland Iff, who will present to you the financials of the transaction.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Christian. Now after a second short extension of the acceptance period, we now own 99.8% of the Sanitec shares. As we are well above the 90% threshold needed to start a squeeze-out procedure to obtain ownership also of the rest of the shares-- of the still outstanding shares, this procedure was already started. The total amount invested is CHF 1.4 billion. This is about CHF 200 million below the amount announced as as of October 14 last year. The difference is mainly due to lower debt to be replaced at Sanitec, and we could also partly benefit from the strength of the Swiss franc. However, on the currency side, we don't -- we did not have the full benefit as we hedged the major part of the FX exposure back in October when we announced the transaction. The financing currently in place consists of a CHF 900 million bridge loan, a 3-year EUR 400 million loan and the currently not used 5-year CHF 300 million revolving facility. The CHF 900 million bridge loan will be replaced by Swiss franc and Eurobonds over the coming weeks. The goodwill resulting out of the first consolidation of the Sanitec Group amounts to about CHF 1 billion. In the currently ongoing purchase price allocation analysis process, part of this goodwill will be allocated to other assets, which then will be depreciated over their lifetime. The remaining final goodwill will not be amortized, but is subject to annual impairment testing. \r\nLet me now briefly comment on Sanitec's financial results 2014. Sanitec's full year sales 2014 decreased by 1.8% to EUR 689 million. Measured in local currencies, sales were up by 0.7%. The 2 regions, South and Central Europe, showed a sales decrease but Northern Europe, Eastern Europe and U.K. were growing in local currencies. The operating profit improved by 6%, due to an improved operational performance, and led to an EBIT margin of 11.4%. On a comparable basis, an increase of 80 basis points. The EBITDA margin increased to 15%. The integration of the 2 companies will have consequences on the reporting. An important change for the Geberit Group will be that we align our sales reporting with Sanitec and switch from reporting sales to reporting net sales or using the IFRS term, revenue from sales. The difference between the 2 numbers are mainly the bonuses and cash discounts we pay to wholesalers. In 2014, Geberit achieved net sales in the amount of CHF 2.0891 billion. Customer bonuses and cash discounts amounted to CHF 350.3 million. As the closing of the transaction took place in early February, we will include only 11 months of the Sanitec results in the consolidated P&L 2015. The sales reporting will show total growth in Swiss francs, as well as the organic and the organic currency-adjusted sales growth rates.\r\nThe Sanitec sales will be included in our reporting as a new product area called ceramics and ceramic complementary products, including 2 product lines. In the current year, we will also have one-off charges out of the purchase accounting exercise, which we will specify with the H1 results and additional transaction costs related to financing cost in a total of about CHF 15 million. With that, I give back to Christian.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Roland. I will now give you an outlook for Geberit in 2015. Let me start with some of our key investment projects. Driven by the positive volume development and a larger product portfolio, we expand our Logistics Center in Pfullendorf, in South Germany. In addition to capacity expansion, we will optimize the long goods storage for pipes and further optimize our logistics due to new technologies and process optimizations. In total, we will invest EUR 40 million and start of the construction will be in the second quarter this year. Start of operations is expected to be in 2017. \r\nA second key project this year is the modernization and optimization of our product site in Langenfeld, also in Germany, where we manufacture our metal piping systems. We will modernize the infrastructure and renew the machinery. This will enable us to introduce new standardized processes and therefore to optimize the cost structure. In total, we will invest CHF 9 million this year in Langenfeld. \r\nLet me now give you a few comments on the impact of the SNB decision releasing the minimum euro-Swiss franc exchange rate on Geberit. The currency split of our sales volume is very similar to the currency split of our cost base, with a slight over-proportional cost base in Swiss francs. Due to this strong natural hedge, the impact of the strength in Swiss franc on the operating margins is limited. In figures, this means that the strengthening of the Swiss francs by 10% against all other currencies leads to a decline of the EBIT level by 9% to 11%, and the decline of the EBIT margin of roughly 50 basis points. However, to cope with the new exchange rate realities and price pressure in Switzerland, we introduced as of February, a temporary currency rebate of 10% for our customers in Switzerland. We will proceed with our strategy to continuously optimize our cost structure towards a perfect, natural hedge. \r\nNow I would like to conclude by summarizing our presentation. Geberit again outperformed the market in 2014 and we delivered operating results on new record levels. The newly introduced products in 2014 prove our innovation leadership and we continued to increase our productivity. We invested into our product production network and our product pipeline and finally, we were able to deliver once again strong cash flow results in 2014. We expect for 2015 another challenging year for the European construction markets. We are confident about Germany, U.K. The market in Switzerland will still operate on a high level. For the markets in Austria, we remain cautious. We do not see any recovery in Benelux, Nordics, Spain, and Portugal. The markets in France and Italy, we expect to further decline and we expect a mixed picture in Central and Eastern Europe. We foresee a further slowdown in China while we remain positive about India. The outlook for the Gulf region and South Africa remains positive. And finally, in the U.S., we see a slowdown of the recovery in the residential segment and no recovery is expected in the more important institutional segment for us. I will close our presentation by summarizing the Geberit outlook for 2015. We are strongly positioned in our core European countries like Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Benelux, and Italy, representing 70% of our sales. Our competitive position is based on our long-term customer relationships, our innovative product portfolio and a strong B2B Geberit brand. For developing countries, we offer a widened product range of products. And we will remain focused on an efficient cost structure and continuous process optimizations. The profitability level will lead to a strong cash generation also in 2014. And with the acquisition of Sanitec, we will expand our business to bathroom ceramics to further strengthen our leadership position in Europe. On the last slide, you will see the key dates for this year, where we will inform about our results during 2015. Many thanks for your attention. Roland Iff and myself are now happy to answer your questions.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Christian Buhl (Executives)】\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our analyst conference and my first conference as new CEO of Geberit. I would also like to take the opportunity to welcome those who are viewing this conference via webcast. Together with Roland Iff, I am pleased to report to you about another very successful year for Geberit. Our presentation is structured as follows: First, I will give you an overview of 2014 and comment on sales development over the last year. Roland Iff will then present the financial results and thereafter, I will introduce the most important new products which we launched this year and give you an outlook of the construction industry and following a few comments regarding Sanitec, I will also comment on perspectives for Geberit in 2015. At the end, I will summarize and take your questions. \r\nIn 2014, the Geberit Group was able to further improve the already very solid results achieved in the previous year. Sales amounted to CHF 2.4 billion, corresponding to an increase of 6.4% in local currencies. The operating cash flow increased by 10.8%, reaching CHF 657 million, a new record level. With 27.3%, the EBITDA margin exceeded our midterm target corridor of 23% to 25%. The operating result also significantly increased by 13% to CHF 577 million. The EBIT margin reached 24.0%. The net income increased by 14.4% to CHF 499 million, corresponding to a margin of 20.7% of sales, also a new record level and first time above 20%. Earnings per share increased by 14.6% to CHF 13.28. At CHF 460 million, the free cash flow exceeded last year's excellent performance by roughly 4%. The Board of Directors proposes a distribution of CHF 8.30 per share to be distributed as a regular dividend. This corresponds to an increase of about 10%. Furthermore, the Board of Directors decided to resume the share buyback program started in 2014 and which was interrupted due to the Sanitec acquisition. \r\nLast year, we were once again able to introduce various new important products. Among others, we launched the Omega flushing systems with corresponding actuator plates. Omega flushing systems offer maximum flexibility, with 3 different system heights. In addition, the extra small actuator plates can be mounted at the front or at the top and provide an elegant, minimalistic design. In addition, we expanded in 2014 our Geberit Monolith family. We introduced WC module Monolith Plus with odor extraction directly from the toilet bowl orientation light and electronic flush activation. In China, we introduced a Monolith washbasin module developed specially for the middle class that is entirely produced in China. The module is available in 4 different options, with different ceramics and faucets. Further, we introduced new and revised Geberit wall draining system, slimmer in design and even easier and safer to install. As an example, for our regular extensions of our pipe and product portfolio, we introduced in 2014 the patent Geberit Sovent fitting. The Sovent fitting increases the flow performance by 40% and hence, enables relatively small-sized drainage stacks especially for high-rise buildings. \r\nLast year, Geberit invested roughly CHF 100 million or 4.4% of sales. This corresponds to an increase of 7.7% versus the previous year. Capacity expansion represented roughly 1/3 of the total investments. Over 40% of investments were dedicated to modernization and rationalizations and investment into new products accounted for 1/4 of the total investment. Let me now continue to highlight a few selected investment projects last year. We completed the newly built production facility in Ruse in Slovenia and started with production in July 2014. In Ruse, we produced fittings for our drainage piping systems, exposed cisterns and walls. The total investments amounted to EUR 60 million, which was in plan. A second key investment in 2014 was the expansion of our Italian production site in Villadose. In Villadose we produce our Geberit drainage pipes. The expansion addresses the volume growth in this important product line. The total investments amounted to EUR 12 million as we took up cap production in October 2014. \r\nAn important event in 2014 was the 50th anniversary of our concealed cistern. Since 1964, Geberit sold more than 60 million concealed cisterns. We celebrated the success with our customers on the occasion of various events. For example, with 5 VIP gala events across Europe that were attended by 3,800 customers. To address a broader customer base, we conducted 36 so-called construction site parties, with 8,500 customers, to strengthen our customer relationships and our brand reputation. \r\nIn addition to the 50th anniversary, we further invested into our customer relationships. As an example, the slide shows our customer activities 2014 in Germany. In total, we conducted 60,000 individual customer visits with our sales force. On top, more than 10,000 customers participated in 1 of our 200 events in Germany, addressing specific topics, for example, training on fire protection with live demonstrations or sales trainings together with AquaClean or new product demonstration with our on-tour events. \r\nLet me now comment on the development of our number of employees. Organic sales growth initiatives contributed to a slight increase of the headcount. Overall, the number of employees at the end of the year 2014 increased by 21 respectively, 0.3%, reaching 6,247 employees. Sales per employee increased to CHF 380,000, an increase of 3.5%. Roughly half of Geberit employees work in production, followed by nearly 1/3 in sales and marketing. Roughly 13% of our employees are active in administration or development, and we have a high number of apprentices which currently represent 4% of our employees. \r\nThe total environmental impact declined further by 1.6% despite the currency-adjusted sales growth of 6.4%. We also achieved a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption by 1%, respectively, 0.5%, versus the previous year, and our recycling rate increased further and reached 85%. In the context of our social engagement, we funded and carried out again a social project in 2014. Ten Geberit employees, paired with 8 apprentices, spent 2 weeks in Varanasi, in India, to renovate the sanitary infrastructure of Kiran Village. Koran Village is a school for 360 children, mostly handicapped. The project was planned, funded and carried out entirely by Geberit. \r\nLet me finish the review of 2014 with an overview of our investments over the last 5 years. The slide shows that we have -- that we follow a long-term investment strategy, with continuous investments in all key areas: into our infrastructure, in R&D and new products and in marketing. These continuous investments build the basis for our future value creation. Let me now comment our sales development 2014 in more detail. \r\nThe sales growth rate in local currencies of 6.4% corresponds to a sales increase of CHF 146 million. The negative currency effect of CHF 34 million or minus 1.5% lead to an overall sales increase by CHF 112 million or 4.9%. In the first half of 2014, sales increased at a higher pace compared to the second 6 months. The stronger growth in the first half of the year can be explained by the relatively weak sales in the first half of the previous year 2013 and the mild winter at the beginning of 2014. All global regions recorded a positive sales growth in local currencies. Europe grew by 5.9%, with positive growth rates in all countries and regions. Sales in America increased by 6.4% and in Middle East and Africa, we were growing by 21.2%. Far East/Pacific also recorded double-digit growth rate, with 12.8%. \r\nLet me now give you a few comments on the different countries and the market developments last year. We outperformed the market in Germany, which showed a higher growth in the first half of the year compared to the second half of the year. We outperformed the market in Switzerland, which was running at full capacity and achieved the growth rate of 6.6%. We generated a currency-adjusted growth rate of 4% in Benelux, where the construction industry is still in crisis. Lower growth rates were recorded in Italy due to a weak market environment. And although the Austrian market is declining since the second half of 2014, we increased sales over the entire year by 2.5%. The Central and Eastern European markets showed, in 2014, a mixed picture. Our sales were growing by 11.7%, driven by double-digit growth in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. In the Nordic region, we faced challenging markets and recorded a sales growth of 2.4%. In France, we achieved a sales growth of 3% despite an overall weak economy. We outperformed the already strong market in U.K., with a double-digit growth rate of nearly 20%. On the Iberian Peninsula, we achieved a slight growth in a stabilized market environment, which is still on historically very low level. In America, the residential sector further recovered. However, the most important sector for Geberit, the institutional sector, remained weak during 2014. In Far East/Pacific, we have seen a slowdown of residential markets in some of our key markets, for example, in China. However, we achieved a double-digit growth in China, India and also in Southeast Asia. The total region grew by 12.8% in local currencies. In Middle East/Africa, the region grew by 21.2%, with double-digit growth rates in the Gulf region as well as in South Africa. \r\nI come now to the sales growth per product area. Both product areas, Sanitary Systems and Piping Systems, grew to a similar extent. The Sanitary Systems generated sales growth of 5.1% to CHF 1.37 billion. Piping Systems exceeded sales of CHF 1 billion with a sales growth of 4.6% in Swiss francs. All product lines contributed to growth, with positive growth rates in local currencies. The product line with the highest sales levels, insulation systems, grew by 7.5%. Building drainage systems showed the strongest development, with almost double-digit growth. Roland Iff will now lead through the financial results 2014.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Roland Iff (Executives)】\nLadies and gentlemen, good morning. For 2014, the group, Geberit Group, can once again present very solid results. Many key figures show all-time high levels. And despite the challenging market conditions, sales development measured in local currency lies slightly above our midterm target corridor and profitability was improved again. I start my presentation with the overview of the most important key figures. Overall, sales increased from CHF 2.2916 billion to CHF 2.4044 billion, corresponding to 4.9% increase. In 2014, currency exchange rate had a negative impact on sales in Swiss francs again. Changes in exchange rate negatively influenced sales by CHF 34 million, which impacted sales growth by minus 1.5%. The 2 major currencies, euro and US dollars, both weakened about 1.3% over the period. The operating cash flows and operating results increased over-proportionally to sales. The net income and EPS also increased at double-digit rates, growing faster than sales. At CHF 498.6 million, the net income reached a margin of 20.7%. And with CHF 460 million, we were also able to again increase our free cash flow. \r\nIn 2014, the EBITDA margin increased by 140 basis points to 27.3%. In absolute terms, EBITDA grew by CHF 64.3 million or 10.8%. On the EBIT level, the increase was CHF 66.2 million or 13%. In the reporting period, the overall unfavorable currency development impacted the results only slightly negatively. \r\nIn the fourth quarter, profitability was improved as well. The previous-year EBITDA margin was exceeded by 1.3 percentage points. Coming to some of the individual cost elements. Due to a favorable volume and volume development and shift in our market mix, the customer bonus quota increased also in 2014 as it already did in 2013. Material cost, as a percentage of sales, decreased from 26.1% to 25.1%, also due to slightly lower raw material prices. After having seen rising purchasing prices in the third quarter, the trend turned again in the fourth quarter. An increase versus the previous year was also recorded in personnel expenses. The cost increase of 1.8% is slightly higher than the increase in workforce, which grew by 1.4% or 84 employees on average. At year end, as we already heard, the increase was then only 0.3%. Further additional cost resulted from tariff increases on average in the group, about 2%, lower pension related expenses had a certain compensating effect. The additional employees, due to the volume growth, were mainly recruited in the European sales and production companies. Marketing expenses were on the previous year's level. In total, other operating expenses increased by 2.8%, which is clearly under proportional to our sales growth. \r\nThe analysis of the EBIT margin development summarizes what I commented before. The volume increase resulted in a margin increase of 1.4%. In 2014, the product mix was neutral. The previously mentioned increase in operating expenses led to a negative impact of only minus 0.4%. The small currency movements did not have a material impact on margins. The overall net margin impact between sales and purchasing price development in 2014 was positive again, and more than compensated the negative impact from the increase in our sales deductions. All in all, EBIT margin increased by 1.7 percentage points versus previous year. \r\nNet income almost reached CHF 500 million with CHF 498.6 million, corresponding to an increase of 14.4% versus previous year. This, compared to the operating results over-proportional increase, is mainly attributable to a slightly lower tax rate and an improved financial result. The improvement in the financial result is due to foreign currency losses, which we incurred in 2013. And the slightly over-proportional EPS growth of 14.6% to CHF 13.28 is driven by the share buyback program started in Q2 2014. \r\nAt CHF 460.4 million, Geberit achieved a 3.6% higher free cash flow than in the previous year. Whereas net cash flow improved in line with the operating profitability, free cash flow growth was slowed down because of an increase in net working capital. This net working capital increased results from a planned inventory buildup to secure delivery performance for certain products. Net investments intangible assets were CHF 7.1 million above previous year, mainly due to the already mentioned production-related projects. Out of this free cash flow of CHF 460 million, a dividend of CHF 282 million was paid and we bought back shares over the second trading line in the amount of CHF 37 million. Corporate cash therefore increased by about CHF 140 million. \r\nAs of the end of 2014, the cash position in the balance sheet therefore increased to almost CHF 750 million. Net cash amounted to CHF 739.2 million. Last year's pension liabilities increased again significantly. The net increase of CHF 67.6 million is, on the one hand, due to lower interest rates which led to a higher DCF value for these liabilities. And the other hand, it is partly compensated by an again, improved capital coverage of the Swiss pension plans. In 2014, this major change does not have a P&L impact, as the net amount is charged to equity. But higher -- but the higher liability level will lead to higher pension cost in 2015. The equity ratio was therefore also reduced from 74.8% to 70.6%. The financing of the group, however, remains solid and we continue to have a basis for an attractive payout policy. \r\nBased on this solid financial situation, the Board of Directors is proposing to the Annual General Meeting a dividend of CHF 8.30 per share. This corresponds to an increase of about 10% versus prior year. On that basis, CHF 312.7 million will be distributed, corresponding to a payout ratio of 62.7%. The Annual General Meeting will be held on April 1, 2015. Subject to the approval by the Annual General Meeting, the share buyback -- sorry, the dividend will be paid out on April 9. In addition, the Board of Directors has decided to continue the share buyback program started in Q2 2014. On a second trading line and over a period of 2 years, we had announced that the time to buy back shares in the amount of 5% of the capital. The shares will be canceled thereafter. As we had to interrupt the program while the Sanitec transaction was ongoing, we only purchased 123,000 shares for a total of CHF 37.4 million so far under the program. This is only 6.5% of the total buyback volume announced at the time. With this, I would now like to hand it back to Christian Buhl.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Christian Buhl (Executives)】\nThank you, Roland. I will now make a few comments on the key product introductions 2015. We will introduce in 2015 a new, premium shower toilet, the AquaClean Mera. You see the picture on the slide. The new Mera combines innovative technology, comfort and design. Smart comfort functions, such as an automatic WC lid, seat heating and an orientation light are combined with a rimless ceramic toilet bowl to ensure highest standards for cleanliness and hygiene. The market introduction of Mera will be in September this year. In the product area of Piping Systems, we will introduce a new hygiene flush system to avoid stagnating water in drinking water systems. The automated flushing ensures safety and highest quality of drinking water in all buildings, especially in public buildings like hotels, hospitals or schools. The hygiene flush can be easily operated with a Geberit app on standard mobile phones. Another important product introduction this year for drainage systems is the new shower channel CleanLine for floor even showers. From an end-user perspective, the Clean Line convinces[ph] with an elegant design and an easy and practical way of cleaning. The advantages for the installers are an easy and secure installation. \r\nEspecially for the developing markets in Europe, we will introduce new actuator plates, Delta. The actuator plates are designed for the middle mass market and are clearly differentiated to our premium segment with the Sigma actuator plate family. After the short tour through some of the new products, allow me now to comment on the outlook in the building industry for 2015.\r\nIn Europe, we expect no recovery and individual markets will develop again very differently. We are confident about positive market growth in Germany and in U.K. In Switzerland, the construction market is running on a high level. However, the impact of the new ForEx reality on the Swiss construction market remains unclear. We are still cautious about the Austrian market development. And we see a mixed picture in Central and Eastern Europe, with a positive development in Poland and mainly uncertain outlooks in the rest of the Eastern region. We expect no recovery in Netherlands, Belgium, Nordics, Spain and Portugal. And we foresee further declines of the markets in France and in Italy. \r\nFor North America, the recovery in the residential building sector has slowed down over the last 6 months. The outlook for the institutional sector remains uncertain, with the healthcare segment still declining, while the educational sector presents an unclear picture on a still historically low level. \r\nLet me now comment on the outlook for Asia. We foresee a further slowdown in the residential market in China. And we are generally positive about India and expect positive growth in this region. The markets in North and Southeast Asia are expected to remain rather flat, with the exceptions of Indonesia and the Philippines. For Australia, we expect generally a positive development of the building sector. \r\nIn the Middle East and Africa region, we see a continued positive growth trend for the Gulf region and we expect also positive market growth rates for South Africa. For the Northern African region and Near East, we are very critical due to the ongoing difficult political situations. \r\nLet me now give you an update on the Sanitec acquisition, which we closed on February 10. I will start with a short recap of the overall deal rationale. \r\nSanitec is the European leader in bathroom ceramics and complementary products. The bathroom ceramics product range includes toilets, wash basins, tanks, bidets, urinals, and ceramic shower trays and represents roughly 75% of Sanitec sales. The ceramics complementary products include bathroom furniture, bathtubs and shower solutions and are responsible for the remaining 25% of sales. The acquisition is a combination of 2 complementary businesses fitting to the European sanitary market. Geberit today is based on sanitary technology and focusing on technology products installed primarily behind the wall. Key decision-makers for us are professionals and qualified installers and planners. Our innovations drive plumbing standards and we build a strong B2B brand over the last decade. Sanitec, on the other hand, strength's is design, with its in front of the wall product portfolio for bathrooms. Hence, the key decision-makers and the influencers are end-users, architects, showrooms and retailers. Innovation in this category drives future bathroom trends. And Sanitec comprises a portfolio of long-standing local end-user brands across Europe. The acquisition of Sanitec is an expansion of our current strategy, based on our 4 pillars. We add the strategically relevant product portfolio of bathroom ceramics and complementary products. Thereby, we expand our focus from sanitary technology behind the wall to sanitary products and design in front of the wall. \r\nThe complementarity of the 2 businesses leads to a compelling acquisition rationale. First, with Sanitec, we will get better access to end-users and their influences, which is of increasing importance in markets where installers are a less-qualified and less-educated. Access to end-users is also key for our shower toilet business Geberit AquaClean. Second, we are able to leverage our combined position at our existing common customers, mostly wholesalers where we can add value. Thirdly, we will leverage the combined product portfolio to increase sales. For example, in projects across Europe. Fourth, with Sanitec, to get access to ceramics know-how and high-quality capacity, which is a key success factor for our shower toilet business, which we are growing in Europe. \r\nFifth, the acquisition is an expansion into a long-term attractive market segment of bathroom equipments. And last and finally, we will create, with this acquisition, the European leader in the sanitary products industry. And we'll remain and keep our strength -- strong position in Europe. The combined pro forma sales for 2014 -- sorry, the pro forma net sales for 2014 are CHF 2.9 billion. This is still based on a euro and Swiss franc of CHF 1.20. We will have 3 equally strong product areas: 40% will be Sanitary Systems; 30% are today's piping business; and 30% will be ceramics and complementary products. Central Europe remains the biggest region with 50% of sales; followed by South Europe with 14%; Nordics 11%; and Eastern Europe with 10%. \r\nWe will integrate the Sanitec organization by function into the Geberit Group. This means that the corporate and sales organization will be fully merged. The operational functions, with manufacturing, product management, logistics, will be complementary integrated into the Geberit Group. The integrated organization will allow us to capture sales and cost synergies of at least EUR 45 million in the midterm, with first synergy impact in 2016. The one-time integration costs will be on the level of the one-time synergy level. To address the increased importance of an integrated marketing and brand management behind the wall and in front of the wall, we expanded the Geberit Executive Board by the Marketing & Brands functions. I will now hand over to Roland Iff, who will present to you the financials of the transaction.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Roland Iff (Executives)】\nThank you, Christian. Now after a second short extension of the acceptance period, we now own 99.8% of the Sanitec shares. As we are well above the 90% threshold needed to start a squeeze-out procedure to obtain ownership also of the rest of the shares-- of the still outstanding shares, this procedure was already started. The total amount invested is CHF 1.4 billion. This is about CHF 200 million below the amount announced as as of October 14 last year. The difference is mainly due to lower debt to be replaced at Sanitec, and we could also partly benefit from the strength of the Swiss franc. However, on the currency side, we don't -- we did not have the full benefit as we hedged the major part of the FX exposure back in October when we announced the transaction. The financing currently in place consists of a CHF 900 million bridge loan, a 3-year EUR 400 million loan and the currently not used 5-year CHF 300 million revolving facility. The CHF 900 million bridge loan will be replaced by Swiss franc and Eurobonds over the coming weeks. The goodwill resulting out of the first consolidation of the Sanitec Group amounts to about CHF 1 billion. In the currently ongoing purchase price allocation analysis process, part of this goodwill will be allocated to other assets, which then will be depreciated over their lifetime. The remaining final goodwill will not be amortized, but is subject to annual impairment testing. \r\nLet me now briefly comment on Sanitec's financial results 2014. Sanitec's full year sales 2014 decreased by 1.8% to EUR 689 million. Measured in local currencies, sales were up by 0.7%. The 2 regions, South and Central Europe, showed a sales decrease but Northern Europe, Eastern Europe and U.K. were growing in local currencies. The operating profit improved by 6%, due to an improved operational performance, and led to an EBIT margin of 11.4%. On a comparable basis, an increase of 80 basis points. The EBITDA margin increased to 15%. The integration of the 2 companies will have consequences on the reporting. An important change for the Geberit Group will be that we align our sales reporting with Sanitec and switch from reporting sales to reporting net sales or using the IFRS term, revenue from sales. The difference between the 2 numbers are mainly the bonuses and cash discounts we pay to wholesalers. In 2014, Geberit achieved net sales in the amount of CHF 2.0891 billion. Customer bonuses and cash discounts amounted to CHF 350.3 million. As the closing of the transaction took place in early February, we will include only 11 months of the Sanitec results in the consolidated P&L 2015. The sales reporting will show total growth in Swiss francs, as well as the organic and the organic currency-adjusted sales growth rates.\r\nThe Sanitec sales will be included in our reporting as a new product area called ceramics and ceramic complementary products, including 2 product lines. In the current year, we will also have one-off charges out of the purchase accounting exercise, which we will specify with the H1 results and additional transaction costs related to financing cost in a total of about CHF 15 million. With that, I give back to Christian.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Christian Buhl (Executives)】\nThank you, Roland. I will now give you an outlook for Geberit in 2015. Let me start with some of our key investment projects. Driven by the positive volume development and a larger product portfolio, we expand our Logistics Center in Pfullendorf, in South Germany. In addition to capacity expansion, we will optimize the long goods storage for pipes and further optimize our logistics due to new technologies and process optimizations. In total, we will invest EUR 40 million and start of the construction will be in the second quarter this year. Start of operations is expected to be in 2017. \r\nA second key project this year is the modernization and optimization of our product site in Langenfeld, also in Germany, where we manufacture our metal piping systems. We will modernize the infrastructure and renew the machinery. This will enable us to introduce new standardized processes and therefore to optimize the cost structure. In total, we will invest CHF 9 million this year in Langenfeld. \r\nLet me now give you a few comments on the impact of the SNB decision releasing the minimum euro-Swiss franc exchange rate on Geberit. The currency split of our sales volume is very similar to the currency split of our cost base, with a slight over-proportional cost base in Swiss francs. Due to this strong natural hedge, the impact of the strength in Swiss franc on the operating margins is limited. In figures, this means that the strengthening of the Swiss francs by 10% against all other currencies leads to a decline of the EBIT level by 9% to 11%, and the decline of the EBIT margin of roughly 50 basis points. However, to cope with the new exchange rate realities and price pressure in Switzerland, we introduced as of February, a temporary currency rebate of 10% for our customers in Switzerland. We will proceed with our strategy to continuously optimize our cost structure towards a perfect, natural hedge. \r\nNow I would like to conclude by summarizing our presentation. Geberit again outperformed the market in 2014 and we delivered operating results on new record levels. The newly introduced products in 2014 prove our innovation leadership and we continued to increase our productivity. We invested into our product production network and our product pipeline and finally, we were able to deliver once again strong cash flow results in 2014. We expect for 2015 another challenging year for the European construction markets. We are confident about Germany, U.K. The market in Switzerland will still operate on a high level. For the markets in Austria, we remain cautious. We do not see any recovery in Benelux, Nordics, Spain, and Portugal. The markets in France and Italy, we expect to further decline and we expect a mixed picture in Central and Eastern Europe. We foresee a further slowdown in China while we remain positive about India. The outlook for the Gulf region and South Africa remains positive. And finally, in the U.S., we see a slowdown of the recovery in the residential segment and no recovery is expected in the more important institutional segment for us. I will close our presentation by summarizing the Geberit outlook for 2015. We are strongly positioned in our core European countries like Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Benelux, and Italy, representing 70% of our sales. Our competitive position is based on our long-term customer relationships, our innovative product portfolio and a strong B2B Geberit brand. For developing countries, we offer a widened product range of products. And we will remain focused on an efficient cost structure and continuous process optimizations. The profitability level will lead to a strong cash generation also in 2014. And with the acquisition of Sanitec, we will expand our business to bathroom ceramics to further strengthen our leadership position in Europe. On the last slide, you will see the key dates for this year, where we will inform about our results during 2015. Many thanks for your attention. Roland Iff and myself are now happy to answer your questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "Yes, this is Thomas Baumann from Mirabaud. I have three questions. One, a technical one, with regard to Sanitec. Can you give us an indication what January -- how much January accounts for full year sales? I suppose it's less than 1 month on average. But is it half or 3/4? That would help, so that we can make an assumption what the 11 months of consolidation will be in 2015. My second question also goes to Sanitec, or the combined strategy, Sanitec and Geberit. What would be, for my mind, obvious, or a way to go for incremental sales would be to do kind of packaged deals or packaged offering, i.e. combining the ceramics with installation systems on one hand, just to make an example, or electronics that you have in the public areas together with the ceramics from Sanitec. Now if you would do that, the question is, are you prepared to kind of sacrifice some margins on the Geberit side in order to get a push for Sanitec's market presence, i.e. should we expect some kind of a margin sacrifice on the Geberit side? That's my second question. And the third is -- goes to the share buyback. The original idea was to buy this 5% back in 2014, 2015. Now, with the suspension over half a year, should we expect also that you expend on the -- also an expansion on the timeline, or is it still the target to conclude the 5% buyback in 2015? Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThank you for your questions. I will start with #2 and #1 and #3 will answer -- Roland Iff. You're right. The long-term strategy is clearly that we can use combined product portfolios to make better product offerings, combined with products behind  the wall and in front of the wall. That will take time. It's too early to say what will be the impact, for example, on margins. But we are now currently combining the business plans and will then, in the second half of the year, also give new guidance of this combined company regarding our sales targets, midterm sales targets and our margin targets. But you are basically right with your assumption that the product bundling, also technology-wise, is one of the drivers of this acquisition.\n\n---\n\nRegarding your first question. Sanitec has a similar seasonality as we have. So if you divide full year sales by 11.5, you're not that far off for the assumption. And then the share buyback program, that's correct, that we announced at 5% at the time, and said that the volume should be around 530 million. That is not achievable anymore now with this long interruption. We will start as of today. But we don't give any indication as right now, how much we can invest until the final date, which remains in Q2 2016. So there's no ambition or idea yet to extend it. We will just do whatever we can within this remaining period. But we will not achieve the 5%.\n\n---\n\nChristian Arnold, Bank Vontobel. Again, question on Sanitec. You mentioned the CHF 1 billion additional goodwill, which then will be partly transferred into other intangible assets, so to say. Could you give us a rough indication, I mean, I know you don't have the analysis concluded. Nevertheless, it's -- I think it's important to know if it's 50% of this CHF 1 billion or 75%, rough indication for how these intangible assets will look like afterwards? Then, in terms of reporting, on slide -- I think, the combined financials, combined sales, is this a new reporting in terms of regional split-up? Are you going or you will still show all sales on country levels, like you do today? And the last question would be on the increased networking capital inventory. You mentioned, somewhat related to product, could you give us -- is it Mera, which resulted in this higher inventory or which kind of product is the reason for that? Thank you.\n\n---\n\nThank you for the questions. I start with #2 and 3, and #1, will answer, Roland. The reporting, in terms of country will not change. We will have the same reporting structure in terms of the geographical split. Regarding the increased inventory level 2014, I can say it was not Mera, because Mera will be introduced this year. So it's not Mera, but we don't go into the details which product it will be -- was.\n\n---\n\nIn terms of split of the goodwill, it certainly will not be 50%. It will be a significantly lower number. With -- in our models, we use 20% and then said we amortize it over 10 years. That those 20%, because that will be allocated to amortizable asset. But I -- that's what we used in our model. Frankly, I do not know yet because we could only start that exercise now. Now we have to go company by company, subsidiary by subsidiary, looking into their balance sheets said and then decide, is there some need for revaluation or not. So I -- we put in 20% in the models. But that number can be as wrong as it -- or right. But it certainly will not be 50%.\n\n---\n\nSo what, 20% intangibles will be amortized [indiscernible]\n\n---\n\nSo then the goodwill would only be CHF 800 million at the end, and CHF 200 million would be distributed over various assets. But again, this is an assumption which is not really based on the work we are doing right now. It's just an experience we have from other exercises.\n\n---\n\nMartin Hüsler, Zurcher Kantonalbank. I also have 3 questions. First of all, a clarification. On the slide where you mentioned the impact of that SMB decision. You show an EBIT margin decline by roughly 50 basis points. I was just wondering, that if this does not include the impact of the rebate you gave in Switzerland, that's question #1. Question #2, can you give guidance for CapEx 2015, for cap rate and also including Sanitec? And the last question is about raw material. Coming -- it came down further in Q4. What is your guidance for this year? Does it -- only Geberit standalone? Does it come back further?\n\n---\n\nThank you for your questions. Your first one, regarding the impact of the SMB decision. The 50 basis points decline of the EBIT margin are excluding any price rebates in Switzerland. Second, regarding your CapEx guidance 2015, we expect CapEx this year total, including Sanitec, of CHF 150 million to CHF 160 million. One part is Sanitec and the other one, our increased CapEx, as you have seen in my presentation mainly to the logistics center and the manufacturing side in Langenfeld. Regarding raw materials. We expect, for the first half of the year, lower raw materials for commodity plastics driven by the lower oil price. We don't expect a significant decrease for special plastics due to supply and demand balance in management in the value chain. On the metal side, we expect lower copper prices in the first half of the year as somehow sideway development of aluminum. And for nickel, we are still cautious if there could be a price increase, especially then in the second half of the year. Overall, we expect slightly lower raw material prices in the first half of the year. Maybe from the...\n\n---\n\nSo question from the webcast. Remo Rosenau, Neue Helvetische Bank. Are some smaller disposals we see in the Sanitec peripheral product range, a possibility looking forward? Or is it just everything fitting just perfectly?\n\n---\n\nI understand the question. But the answer is too early or the question's too early to answer. We acquired the company 4 weeks ago. We will see what fits and what not. But I can't just answer now. It's just too early.\n\n---\n\nAnd the second question from Remo Rosenau. The tax rate was very low in the last few years due to the favorable tax deal with Germany. This effect was expected to reverse again gradually over the next few years, and could you update now us on this effect, and if the Sanitec deal has any impact on this tax deal whatsoever?\n\n---\n\n[indiscernible] doesn't have an impact on [indiscernible] the guidance for the moment is combined around 15% for 2015 and 2016. Midterm, it's in the area of 18% to 20%.\n\n---\n\nOkay, a question from Robbie Fryer from [indiscernible] Capital. It is fair to assume that Geberit will drive the productivity of Sanitec to at least the productivity of the benchmark in the ceramic segment?\n\n---\n\nWe will definitely -- first of all, I remarked before, Sanitec is already a benchmark in the ceramics industry, meaning that the margin level of Sanitec compared to competition is on a high level already, because they had one Sanitec program running for 5 years where they increased the profitability already. For sure, we will improve profitability more. It's one source of the synergies. But we have to be clear. The margin level of Sanitec will never reach the margin level of the Geberit standalone business.\n\n---\n\nThen a question from Manish [indiscernible] from Société Générale. What is your long-term target net debt-to-EBITDA? Should we interpret that you will distribute all your free cash flows and dividends and buyback from 2015 onwards?\n\n---\n\nNo. We will drive back the debt as we did it in the past, but you have seen, we will refinance the bridge loan which we have in place now with bonds, which have slightly longer terms, so probably will take -- no, it will take longer than in, for example, when we did Sanitec to bring down the back -- the debt.\r\nAny further questions in the [indiscernible]?\n\n---\n\nMartin Flueckiger Kepler Cheuvreux. Two questions, please. Firstly on the Q4 margin, if I remember correctly, as you had to recently, or in January, you had guided for an EBITDA margin of 26% to 27%. Now I realize, for the full year, it's only a small discrepancy. But apparently-- but obviously, for the fourth quarter, it's quite a significant one, at least comparing to the consensus this morning. Yet, quite an outstanding increase in the EBITDA margin in Q4. Were there any surprises for you in there? And if you could elaborate a little bit, similar to your full year 2014 EBIT bridge, what the key drivers were particularly in the fourth quarter, that would be very helpful. And then coming back to the euro discount of 10% in Switzerland. Is that across the portfolio, or we can see this only on selective product lines? And also here, with this respect, what are the main criteria regarding the duration of these discounts?\n\n---\n\nI start with question 2. Question 1, I hand over to Roland Iff. First, a 10% currency rebate in Switzerland is across the entire portfolio. The level of this rebate will depend on the development, the further development of the currency rate. That's the meaning of temporary. We will review regularly this rebate based on the development on the currency, mainly euro to Swiss francs.\n\n---\n\nQ4 main drivers, I would say, 3. One is, as the volume is going back and the sales companies adjusted their rebates, they give to wholesalers and that's always a whole year rebate. But then the adjustment falls into Q3. So if you look at the bonuses as a percentage of sale, it was significantly lower than for the other 3 quarters. Second, in the third quarter, we had seen this rising raw material prices, and then that turned against -- raw material prices were better than what we had expected in -- at the end of Q3. And then thirdly, operating expenses were right in line with sales growth or operating expense were with what's in line with sales growth, and there you usually have some volatility. So that is difficult to plan, then, for the full year. So that's probably -- it was at the lower end of our expectations after 9 months.\n\n---\n\nTorsten Wyss from UBS. Just one question. On the raw materials, I mean, with the full year results, topline results, you indicated like a rather negative raw material development in Q4 on higher metal prices, if I remember correctly. Now you did state that you're not negative on the metal prices, at least not on copper. Plastic is going to come down. That's quite obvious. Still, you say you expect a slight lower raw material level in H1. Wouldn't we rather have to expect substantially lower raw materials in 2015 or at least in H1? The impact must be quite strong in a positive way for you, mustn't it?\n\n---\n\nYou can now debate what is the meeting between slight and then strong, which is a kind of wording debate as well. But you're right. That it's in favor of our side, that's right. But we are so cautious for certain raw materials, especially for the special plastics, depending on supply and demand management, in the value chain before, which you can't really control, so you have to not only look at the raw materials itself, so you have to take into account as well the prefabrication steps and that's the reason why we are slightly, maybe conservative in your point of view.\n\n---\n\nSpeaking about slight and strong. I mean the impact in Q4 was 150 basis points year-over-year positive. I would assume for the full year '15 to have also, at least 150 basis points less cost of goods sold in percentage of sales. Would you agree with that indication?\n\n---\n\nMaybe one item I didn't mention before when Mr. Flueckiger asked his question. We had a very favorable mix in Q4. Piping Systems was flat, all the growth was coming from Sanitary Systems. That helped as well. So I wouldn't see that as the benchmark for full year 2015, 2016 -- '15, '15.\n\n---\n\nPatrick Appenzeller from Helvea Baader. I have 2 questions. First of all, I want to double check the costs related to Sanitec in '15 and also the other years. When I understand it correctly. You have this integration costs, one-time synergies, which you will obviously book in the current year. So what-- does that mean we have to expect CHF 45 million integration costs you book operationally? I assume in '15? And the transaction costs, the same question here, CHF 50 million, you mentioned. Is that where it will -- that be booked? In which years? And synergies, you say nothing this year. Do we have to expect like '15, in '16, '17 in -- 30 in '17 and 45 in '18, is that the best assumption? And the other question there is related to Q1. February probably is -- has a very strong base. We will see how much will be. But do you expect still organic growth in the first quarter, given the tough weather comparison?\n\n---\n\nSo I start with question 2. We, as you know, we don't give any quantitive guidance before our first half results in August. So therefore, I only can repeat what you said. We have a strong base effect in Q1, driven by Q1 2014. Regarding your first question, the integration cost, the CHF 45 million. That will be spread along the integration period, which will take 2 to 3 years. So don't expect the CHF 45 million integration costs to be booked in this year. And the synergy, how they will develop over the full capture of CHF 45 million until midterm, meaning more or less, 2018, that they would gradually increase. But I can't tell you exactly how the pace will be. Just one thing, we will start to capture synergies as of next year. And we'll end up at CHF 45 million in 2018. Regarding the transaction costs, I ask Roland to comment.\n\n---\n\nTotal transaction cost of CHF 23 million. Out of this CHF 23 million, we have booked CHF 3 million in 2014, CHF 15 million will be booked in 2015, split half between financial fees which go -- and below the EBIT line and the other half is above the EBIT line. So that's consulting expenses. And then CHF 5 million will be amortized over the lifetime of the financial instruments. So that's related to the bonds and the bank loans which will remain in place. In addition, we will have this year, a one-off cost out of the purchase price allocation exercise. That means we will have to reevaluate our inventories and then you turn those, obviously, at least once per year. So that whole revaluation difference goes into the P&L immediately. And we will have then, what I said before, from that part of the goodwill which goes to amortizable. The depreciatiable assets-- that's going to be in the 2015 and '16, '17 results as well. We will give more guidance with that when we publish the H1 results.\n\n---\n\nAnd we will work within adjusted net earnings, adjusted EPS for 2015 to exclude all these one-off effects, which many of them are noncash.\n\n---\n\nA question from Amy Gala [ph] from Citi. Can you comment on your medium-term expectations in terms of organic sales growth and EBITDA margin after the Sanitec deal?\n\n---\n\nNo, not yet. As what Roland Iff just said, that we will currently combine the business plans and fill up the new business plan. And we will communicate new guidance in the second half of the year regarding sales and also margins, the combined business.\n\n---\n\nA question from Michael Watts from Berenberg. In the outlook, you say that challenge in this sector remains complex and huge from today's perspective, are expected to become even more pronounced in the medium term. In what way do you expect these challenges to intensify?\n\n---\n\nWe have still difficult markets in Europe, as I've shown in my presentation. There are only a few, very few markets which are really going good or positive. There are more markets which are still in a crisis, are not developing and they are still declining markets. We don't have any signs that also midterm, the picture will improve.\n\n---\n\nTwo questions from Tobias Loskamp from HSBC. Do you expect any negative impact on renovation behavior in Germany from the introduction of regional rental caps by the German government?\n\n---\n\nI have to be open. I don't know the answer. Very little. I don't know.\n\n---\n\nAnd second question, how much of your cash will you invest in the Sanitec acquisition?\n\n---\n\nIt's about CHF 250 million.\n\n---\n\nChristian Arnold, Bank Vontobel. A follow-up question on your CapEx guidance of CHF 150 million. You have mentioned the investments you are planning and then there are some investments for Geberit. Nevertheless, it looks like that it's quite a big portion coming from Sanitec, compared to the size, when we compare Sanitec to Geberit. So I wonder if investments is somewhat lagging, as Sanitec used to be owned by a private equity? Do you have to invest more in Sanitec, compared to Geberit in the coming years? And with that, this CHF 150 million, is that some of the guidance we could also use for the years after 2015? And the second question relates to net working capital. As -- if I'm not mistaken, also again, compared to Geberit, Sanitec has higher net working capital when we compare the absolute size. Are you able to bring that down or do we have to do, for the time being, calculate with higher net working capital? Thank you.\n\n---\n\nSo regarding your first question, if you look at the history of Sanitec, you see they have invested last year, about CHF 25 million, EUR 20 million, last year, which is a little bit lower in terms of sales compared to Geberit, but not substantially lower. In the other CHF 150 million to CHF 160 million, we have included about 30 -- CHF 25 million to CHF 30 million for Sanitec. Your question, if there is an underinvestment or an additional investment need, of course, there was a private equity owned company. The question is too early to answer. We are currently reviewing all the sites, and we are making corresponding plans and concepts. But it's just too early to answer this question. Regarding the net working capital, Roland?\n\n---\n\nI wouldn't say that they have a significantly or higher net working capital than Geberit, they have a similar seasonality as we have. So it increases over the course of the year and then comes down back at the end of the year. What they had at the, last, at the end of 2014, they had some higher inventories as well, due to the lower volumes which they have seen in Q4. But nothing in particular.\n\n---\n\nThere is one.\n\n---\n\nMartin Flueckiger, from Kepler Cheuvreux. You actually just gave the key word, lower volumes at Sanitec in Q4. Now that we have seen organic sales decline, and I think on underlying terms, the EBIT margin was also, I think, slightly declining in Q4 for Sanitec. Have recent developments changed or adjusted your approach in integrating Sanitec, or to push for cross-selling synergies in any way?\n\n---\n\nNo. The recent development of Sanitec does not have an influence on -- that's what you're mentioning. Maybe one comment to the lower margin of Sanitec in Q4, slightly lowered margin compared to Q4 2013. That was mainly driven by the sales decrease, the volume decrease. Sanitec has a higher operating leverage compared to the Geberit business. It's higher fixed cost base. So lower volumes have a high impact on the margin. The margin was positively influenced in Q4 and Sanitec also by the product mix and by sales increases. So it was mainly driven by lower volumes, and it doesn't have any impact on our considerations regarding the integration.\n\n---\n\nQuestion from Robert Donald from Brummer. Market shares. Could you -- could the group update us on its view of its market share in its key markets and also update us on the penetration of integrated flushing systems per key market? In other words, where does the group see the best medium-term growth outlook?\n\n---\n\nWe don't talk about market shares and technology penetration numbers, especially not in specific markets. But I can comment, as you see that with the sales result, 2014, in all the markets, more or less in Europe, we were able to outperform the market by technology, by various strategy, meaning having the technology selling higher value product. So we outperformed the markets, we increased market shares, but we don't talk about in detail about our market shares. About the outlook, we are confident in these markets that we are well-positioned to further increase our market penetration, be it by technology, be it by existing products.\n\n---\n\nAnd a question from Ms. Daripa from GEO Capital. You mentioned integration in the sales team between Sanitec and Geberit. Do you believe Sanitec's sales team can be trained to deal with wholesale customers, brackets behind the wall products? It seems like the skill set might be slightly different, compared to retail customers.\n\n---\n\nI understand the question. It's a question which is quite early. We are in the preparation phase of integration. We started the integration in second quarter this year. So it's too early to answer the question, but it's clear. It is one of the key challenges to train the respective sales forces to the broader product portfolio. \r\nOkay. I think -- no questions anymore. Thank you very much for attending our conference. Good afternoon.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Thomas Baumann (Analysts)】\nYes, this is Thomas Baumann from Mirabaud. I have three questions. One, a technical one, with regard to Sanitec. Can you give us an indication what January -- how much January accounts for full year sales? I suppose it's less than 1 month on average. But is it half or 3/4? That would help, so that we can make an assumption what the 11 months of consolidation will be in 2015. My second question also goes to Sanitec, or the combined strategy, Sanitec and Geberit. What would be, for my mind, obvious, or a way to go for incremental sales would be to do kind of packaged deals or packaged offering, i.e. combining the ceramics with installation systems on one hand, just to make an example, or electronics that you have in the public areas together with the ceramics from Sanitec. Now if you would do that, the question is, are you prepared to kind of sacrifice some margins on the Geberit side in order to get a push for Sanitec's market presence, i.e. should we expect some kind of a margin sacrifice on the Geberit side? That's my second question. And the third is -- goes to the share buyback. The original idea was to buy this 5% back in 2014, 2015. Now, with the suspension over half a year, should we expect also that you expend on the -- also an expansion on the timeline, or is it still the target to conclude the 5% buyback in 2015?

But it certainly will not be 50%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christian Arnold (Analysts)】\nSo what, 20% intangibles will be amortized [indiscernible]\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roland Iff (Executives)】\nSo then the goodwill would only be CHF 800 million at the end, and CHF 200 million would be distributed over various assets.

On the slide where you mentioned the impact of that SMB decision. You show an EBIT margin decline by roughly 50 basis points. I was just wondering, that if this does not include the impact of the rebate you gave in Switzerland, that's question #1.

Your first one, regarding the impact of the SMB decision. The 50 basis points decline of the EBIT margin are excluding any price rebates in Switzerland.

Two questions, please. Firstly on the Q4 margin, if I remember correctly, as you had to recently, or in January, you had guided for an EBITDA margin of 26% to 27%. Now I realize, for the full year, it's only a small discrepancy. But apparently-- but obviously, for the fourth quarter, it's quite a significant one, at least comparing to the consensus this morning. Yet, quite an outstanding increase in the EBITDA margin in Q4. Were there any surprises for you in there? And if you could elaborate a little bit, similar to your full year 2014 EBIT bridge, what the key drivers were particularly in the fourth quarter, that would be very helpful. And then coming back to the euro discount of 10% in Switzerland. Is that across the portfolio, or we can see this only on selective product lines? And also here, with this respect, what are the main criteria regarding the duration of these discounts?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christian Buhl (Executives)】\nI start with question 2. Question 1, I hand over to Roland Iff. First, a 10% currency rebate in Switzerland is across the entire portfolio. The level of this rebate will depend on the development, the further development of the currency rate. That's the meaning of temporary. We will review regularly this rebate based on the development on the currency, mainly euro to Swiss francs.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roland Iff (Executives)】\nQ4 main drivers, I would say, 3. One is, as the volume is going back and the sales companies adjusted their rebates, they give to wholesalers and that's always a whole year rebate. But then the adjustment falls into Q3. So if you look at the bonuses as a percentage of sale, it was significantly lower than for the other 3 quarters. Second, in the third quarter, we had seen this rising raw material prices, and then that turned against -- raw material prices were better than what we had expected in -- at the end of Q3. And then thirdly, operating expenses were right in line with sales growth or operating expense were with what's in line with sales growth, and there you usually have some volatility. So that is difficult to plan, then, for the full year. So that's probably -- it was at the lower end of our expectations after 9 months.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Torsten Wyss (Analysts)】\nTorsten Wyss from UBS. Just one question. On the raw materials, I mean, with the full year results, topline results, you indicated like a rather negative raw material development in Q4 on higher metal prices, if I remember correctly. Now you did state that you're not negative on the metal prices, at least not on copper. Plastic is going to come down. That's quite obvious. Still, you say you expect a slight lower raw material level in H1. Wouldn't we rather have to expect substantially lower raw materials in 2015 or at least in H1? The impact must be quite strong in a positive way for you, mustn't it?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christian Buhl (Executives)】\nYou can now debate what is the meeting between slight and then strong, which is a kind of wording debate as well. But you're right. That it's in favor of our side, that's right. But we are so cautious for certain raw materials, especially for the special plastics, depending on supply and demand management, in the value chain before, which you can't really control, so you have to not only look at the raw materials itself, so you have to take into account as well the prefabrication steps and that's the reason why we are slightly, maybe conservative in your point of view.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Torsten Wyss (Analysts)】\nSpeaking about slight and strong. I mean the impact in Q4 was 150 basis points year-over-year positive. I would assume for the full year '15 to have also, at least 150 basis points less cost of goods sold in percentage of sales. Would you agree with that indication?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roland Iff (Executives)】\nMaybe one item I didn't mention before when Mr. Flueckiger asked his question. We had a very favorable mix in Q4. Piping Systems was flat, all the growth was coming from Sanitary Systems. That helped as well. So I wouldn't see that as the benchmark for full year 2015, 2016 -- '15, '15.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Patrick Appenzeller (Analysts)】\nPatrick Appenzeller from Helvea Baader. I have 2 questions. First of all, I want to double check the costs related to Sanitec in '15 and also the other years. When I understand it correctly. You have this integration costs, one-time synergies, which you will obviously book in the current year. So what-- does that mean we have to expect CHF 45 million integration costs you book operationally? I assume in '15? And the transaction costs, the same question here, CHF 50 million, you mentioned. Is that where it will -- that be booked? In which years? And synergies, you say nothing this year. Do we have to expect like '15, in '16, '17 in -- 30 in '17 and 45 in '18, is that the best assumption? And the other question there is related to Q1. February probably is -- has a very strong base. We will see how much will be. But do you expect still organic growth in the first quarter, given the tough weather comparison?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christian Buhl (Executives)】\nSo I start with question 2. We, as you know, we don't give any quantitive guidance before our first half results in August. So therefore, I only can repeat what you said. We have a strong base effect in Q1, driven by Q1 2014. Regarding your first question, the integration cost, the CHF 45 million. That will be spread along the integration period, which will take 2 to 3 years. So don't expect the CHF 45 million integration costs to be booked in this year. And the synergy, how they will develop over the full capture of CHF 45 million until midterm, meaning more or less, 2018, that they would gradually increase. But I can't tell you exactly how the pace will be. Just one thing, we will start to capture synergies as of next year. And we'll end up at CHF 45 million in 2018. Regarding the transaction costs, I ask Roland to comment.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roland Iff (Executives)】\nTotal transaction cost of CHF 23 million. Out of this CHF 23 million, we have booked CHF 3 million in 2014, CHF 15 million will be booked in 2015, split half between financial fees which go -- and below the EBIT line and the other half is above the EBIT line. So that's consulting expenses. And then CHF 5 million will be amortized over the lifetime of the financial instruments. So that's related to the bonds and the bank loans which will remain in place. In addition, we will have this year, a one-off cost out of the purchase price allocation exercise. That means we will have to reevaluate our inventories and then you turn those, obviously, at least once per year. So that whole revaluation difference goes into the P&L immediately. And we will have then, what I said before, from that part of the goodwill which goes to amortizable. The depreciatiable assets-- that's going to be in the 2015 and '16, '17 results as well. We will give more guidance with that when we publish the H1 results.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christian Buhl (Executives)】\nAnd we will work within adjusted net earnings, adjusted EPS for 2015 to exclude all these one-off effects, which many of them are noncash.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roman Sidler (Executives)】\nA question from Amy Gala [ph] from Citi. Can you comment on your medium-term expectations in terms of organic sales growth and EBITDA margin after the Sanitec deal?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christian Buhl (Executives)】\nNo, not yet. As what Roland Iff just said, that we will currently combine the business plans and fill up the new business plan. And we will communicate new guidance in the second half of the year regarding sales and also margins, the combined business.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roman Sidler (Executives)】\nA question from Michael Watts from Berenberg. In the outlook, you say that challenge in this sector remains complex and huge from today's perspective, are expected to become even more pronounced in the medium term. In what way do you expect these challenges to intensify?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christian Buhl (Executives)】\nWe have still difficult markets in Europe, as I've shown in my presentation. There are only a few, very few markets which are really going good or positive. There are more markets which are still in a crisis, are not developing and they are still declining markets. We don't have any signs that also midterm, the picture will improve.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roman Sidler (Executives)】\nTwo questions from Tobias Loskamp from HSBC. Do you expect any negative impact on renovation behavior in Germany from the introduction of regional rental caps by the German government?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christian Buhl (Executives)】\nI have to be open. I don't know the answer. Very little. I don't know.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roman Sidler (Executives)】\nAnd second question, how much of your cash will you invest in the Sanitec acquisition?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christian Buhl (Executives)】\nIt's about CHF 250 million.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Christian Arnold (Analysts)】\nChristian Arnold, Bank Vontobel. A follow-up question on your CapEx guidance of CHF 150 million. You have mentioned the investments you are planning and then there are some investments for Geberit. Nevertheless, it looks like that it's quite a big portion coming from Sanitec, compared to the size, when we compare Sanitec to Geberit. So I wonder if investments is somewhat lagging, as Sanitec used to be owned by a private equity? Do you have to invest more in Sanitec, compared to Geberit in the coming years? And with that, this CHF 150 million, is that some of the guidance we could also use for the years after 2015? And the second question relates to net working capital. As -- if I'm not mistaken, also again, compared to Geberit, Sanitec has higher net working capital when we compare the absolute size. Are you able to bring that down or do we have to do, for the time being, calculate with higher net working capital? Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christian Buhl (Executives)】\nSo regarding your first question, if you look at the history of Sanitec, you see they have invested last year, about CHF 25 million, EUR 20 million, last year, which is a little bit lower in terms of sales compared to Geberit, but not substantially lower. In the other CHF 150 million to CHF 160 million, we have included about 30 -- CHF 25 million to CHF 30 million for Sanitec. Your question, if there is an underinvestment or an additional investment need, of course, there was a private equity owned company. The question is too early to answer. We are currently reviewing all the sites, and we are making corresponding plans and concepts. But it's just too early to answer this question. Regarding the net working capital, Roland?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roland Iff (Executives)】\nI wouldn't say that they have a significantly or higher net working capital than Geberit, they have a similar seasonality as we have. So it increases over the course of the year and then comes down back at the end of the year. What they had at the, last, at the end of 2014, they had some higher inventories as well, due to the lower volumes which they have seen in Q4. But nothing in particular.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christian Buhl (Executives)】\nThere is one.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Martin Flueckiger (Analysts)】\nMartin Flueckiger, from Kepler Cheuvreux. You actually just gave the key word, lower volumes at Sanitec in Q4. Now that we have seen organic sales decline, and I think on underlying terms, the EBIT margin was also, I think, slightly declining in Q4 for Sanitec. Have recent developments changed or adjusted your approach in integrating Sanitec, or to push for cross-selling synergies in any way?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christian Buhl (Executives)】\nNo. The recent development of Sanitec does not have an influence on -- that's what you're mentioning. Maybe one comment to the lower margin of Sanitec in Q4, slightly lowered margin compared to Q4 2013. That was mainly driven by the sales decrease, the volume decrease. Sanitec has a higher operating leverage compared to the Geberit business. It's higher fixed cost base. So lower volumes have a high impact on the margin. The margin was positively influenced in Q4 and Sanitec also by the product mix and by sales increases. So it was mainly driven by lower volumes, and it doesn't have any impact on our considerations regarding the integration.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roman Sidler (Executives)】\nQuestion from Robert Donald from Brummer. Market shares. Could you -- could the group update us on its view of its market share in its key markets and also update us on the penetration of integrated flushing systems per key market? In other words, where does the group see the best medium-term growth outlook?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christian Buhl (Executives)】\nWe don't talk about market shares and technology penetration numbers, especially not in specific markets. But I can comment, as you see that with the sales result, 2014, in all the markets, more or less in Europe, we were able to outperform the market by technology, by various strategy, meaning having the technology selling higher value product. So we outperformed the markets, we increased market shares, but we don't talk about in detail about our market shares. About the outlook, we are confident in these markets that we are well-positioned to further increase our market penetration, be it by technology, be it by existing products.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Roman Sidler (Executives)】\nAnd a question from Ms. Daripa from GEO Capital. You mentioned integration in the sales team between Sanitec and Geberit. Do you believe Sanitec's sales team can be trained to deal with wholesale customers, brackets behind the wall products? It seems like the skill set might be slightly different, compared to retail customers.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Christian Buhl (Executives)】\nI understand the question. It's a question which is quite early. We are in the preparation phase of integration. We started the integration in second quarter this year. So it's too early to answer the question, but it's clear. It is one of the key challenges to train the respective sales forces to the broader product portfolio. \r\nOkay. I think -- no questions anymore. Thank you very much for attending our conference.

      "transcript_text1": "Ladies and gentlemen, the conference will now begin with Mr. Pedro Soares dos Santos, Chairman of Jerónimo Martins Group. Mr. Pedro Soares dos Santos, you have the floor.\n\n---\n\nLadies and gentlemen, good morning, and thank you for joining this call to present Jerónimo team's full-year results. 2014 was not a business as usual year, neither for the food retail sector nor for our Jerónimo teams. Food deflation hit Portugal and Poland harder than we expected, forcing our companies to find new strategies and tactics to manage in a tougher environment. Despite all the challenge, our main business outperformed their respective markets and post positive like-for-like sales in volumes. This means that our capacity to track and retain consumers was reinforced during the year. All in all, we ended 2015 stronger and better prepared to face the future.\r\nWe delivered in our main objects of growing sales ahead of the market where we operate and manage to have EUR 851 million to our consolidated sales that increased to EUR 12.7 billion.\r\nTotal sales were very much support by expansion, mainly in Poland, where Biedronka opened 211 new stores. Year -- in a year of strategic review of the whole value proposition, Biedronka decide to implement a sales booster program to regain like-for-like sales more. And there are already signs in line with what we expected. At the same time, the company is adjusting the pace of expansion to more selected criteria in terms of new locations.\r\nBiedronka's present network scale, both stores and distribution centers, allow us to keep growing at a different region without compromising our target to reach the 3,000 store check. Still, Biedronka benefited from the large share of the group CapEx in 2014, EUR 361 million, and will continue to be our main priority in terms of investments in 2015 and in the coming years.\r\nAs we expect food deflation to continue in Poland in 2015, Biedronka will have to be very strict in terms of cost discipline while focused on reinforcing innovation in its offer to make sure it takes most of it out of the current store network. In 2014, Biedronka's contribution to the group's EBITDA increased to 78%, stressing its rule of our main growth and profitability drive. The combination of deflation at the top line with inflation at the cost level, mainly in wage and rent sales, negatively impacts Biedronka's EBITDA margin and, as a consequence, the group's profits.\r\nDespite extra pressure at all fronts, Jerónimo's teams increased by 41% its cash flow generation to EUR 267 million. The strong consolidated pro forma results also in those proven capacity outperformed its market. Strong cash flow generation combined with a solid balance sheet create the necessary conditions for the group to continue investing in its future growth.\r\nAs we approach the end of our second full year of operations in Colombia, I do believe that Ara will play an increasing important role in our portfolio and further expansion plans. This year, we will test our business model in a very different region of the country, which we will provide that with value strategic insight as we go forward.\r\nBecause -- before giving the floor, 2014 allow solid -- does not reflect our full potential to deliver, although solid does not reflect our full potential to deliver. After incorporation 2014 learnings, it's now time for us to execute at our best level in all the countries.\r\nThank you, once again, for your attention. I'll now leave you with Ana Luísa.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Mr. Pedro Soares dos Santos. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you again for joining the call. I will start by bringing you some context to the year. In Poland, GDP and private consumption remain stable. The pressure came from food deflation. Debt, as seen in other European markets, accelerated along the year, particularly in the second half, reaching minus 0.9% in the year, which compares with food inflation of plus 2% in 2013. In Portugal, the food retail market remained under pressure in an enduring difficult environment. Food deflation was at minus 1.3% in the year, with higher levels in Q2 and Q3 and sometimes [ph] a slowdown towards the year-end.\r\nThis environment brought one further challenge to our performance. We were surprised by much higher than expected levels of food deflation, both in Poland and in Portugal. We believe that we should not manage against deflation, and we did not, as this would risk our competitive position. Therefore, our profitability was impacted by the imbalance between top line deflation and cost inflation. Managing in this deflationary environment, our main companies are becoming stricter on their cost structures to protect profitability.\r\n2014 was also marked by Biedronka's strategic review. Our biggest company took the year to identify opportunities to grow not only organically, but mainly in the current selling area, a plan to take the full potential from the existing stores we've built and is now being implemented. In this context, group sales grew 7.2% to EUR 12.7 billion, with reinforcement of the competitive position of all our banners. Food deflation, already mentioned, together with very competitive market realities, pressured EBITDA and net results, which declined 5.6% and 21.1%, respectively. Despite the pressure on profitability, the strong cash flow generated by our own main business, Biedronka and Pingo Doce, more than compensated the startup investments.\r\nNet debt stood at EUR 273 million with gearing at 16.7%, an extremely solid financial situation. Despite all the challenges, there were key achievements in the year that allowed us to reinforce our competitive position. First, all our banners focused on sales growth and market share increase, and delivered positively on these objectives.\r\nBiedronka, Pingo Doce sales grew ahead of their respective markets and increased market shares, ending the year with a stronger competitive position. To deliver on these objectives, there were 2 fields of action, like-for-like performance and organic expansion program. For Biedronka, the store opening program was the main driver of the 1.1-percentage-point market share increase in the year. Our Polish company has, in terms of like-for-like performance, 2 difficult quarters in the beginning of the year. Nevertheless, volume performance on a like-for-like base improved in Q3 and Q4. Pingo Doce's performance was driven by the like-for-like growth, and the company gained 0.6 percentage points of market share, reaching 18.2% by the year-end.\r\nThe second achievement, strong cash flow generation. In 2014, the group generated a cash flow of EUR 267 million, EUR 78 million more than 2013, although it kept investing in business to guarantee future growth. And despite the pressure of deflation on profitability and the evolution of losses from the new businesses, pretax ROIC was at a healthy 21%. Regarding the income statement for the fourth quarter of the year, I highlight the following. Top line grew 7%, supported by expansion and positive volume performance of Biedronka and Pingo Doce. Total margin went from 21.7% to 21.3%, reflecting the commercial developments in the different businesses.\r\nThe increased weight of the operating costs from 15.2% to 15.7% of sales, mainly resulting from the imbalance between food deflation at the top line and cost inflation, impacting the capacity to dilute operating cost. At the EBITDA level, the losses from Ara and Hebe were EUR 15 million in the quarter. As a consequence, EBITDA margin was 100 basis points lower than previous years. The profit in associated companies was down from EUR 5 million in Q4 2013 to EUR 1 million in Q4 2014. Worth mentioning that in Q4 '13, this having benefited from a one-off income, the underlying figure being similar in the 2 periods.\r\nMinority interests were at minus EUR 4.6 million in the quarter. And I recall that in Q4 '13 figure was impacted by negative one-off items affecting Pingo Doce's results.\r\nLooking now to the income statement of the year, I would highlight the EBITDA margin decline of 80 bps, strongly impacted by the deleveraging effect of deflation that in the case of Biedronka was not offset by the volumes growth. The financial expenses, which were EUR 34 million, EUR 4.5 million below previous year, mainly due to the improvement of the average cost of debt, which in 2014 was at 3.7%.\r\nNon-recurrence were at EUR 9 million incorporating several different items as indemnities, some impairments and contingencies. And effective tax rate increased from 22.9% to 25.1% mainly due to the increase of the wage and value of losses in the new businesses.\r\nMoving now to the cash flow statement. The free cash flow was EUR 267 million, EUR 78 million more than in 2013 already after CapEx payments of EUR 486 million. This performance reflects the real strengths of our businesses, and is the result of a solid operating performance despite all challenges and a strict management of the working capital that remains the key area of efficiency in our businesses. Also contributing to the cash generated was the decrease in the CapEx payments following the slowdown in Biedronka's expansion. The strength of the balance sheets was reinforced, and net debt was reduced by EUR 73 million, ending the year at EUR 273 million. Net debt to EBITDA was at 0.4 and interest covered at 13x, with a gearing of 16.7%, clearly reflecting a solid financial position for the group. In line with the established dividend policy, the Board of Directors will propose on the General Shareholders Meeting of April 9, a growth dividend of EUR 0.245 per share, representing a dividend yield of 2.24% over the average share price registered in 2014.\r\nI will now go into a more detailed analysis of our businesses' performance starting with the group. Group sales increased EUR 851 million to EUR 12.7 billion, a growth of 7.2%. The negative internal basket inflation in Biedronka, Pingo Doce and Recheio impacted the group's like-for-like growth that was slightly negative at minus 0.4%, a word to the fact that the group like-for-likes following Biedronka and Pingo Doce's solid performance improved in the last quarter of the year and was positive at plus 0.6%. The sales of Ara and Hebe reached EUR 152 million and increased EUR 72 million related to 2013, including the exchange rates impact.\r\nIn the business areas, I will start with Biedronka that during 2014, and always guided by the mission of putting consumer satisfaction in preference at the center of all these decisions work mainly on 2 priorities. One, improved sales density, opportunities to improve its offer and, hence, to grow share of wallet were identified. And the company ended 2014 with a clear plan to uplift its sales density to be implemented throughout 2015. Two, reinforce its presence in the markets. To guarantee that the company continues to grab the potential identified in the market, 211 new stores were opened and 3 new distribution centers were built to support expansion and efficiency.\r\nWhen analyzing the sales performance, we need to start by saying that food inflation deteriorated very fast, impacting our internal basket deflation that was at minus 1.8% for the year. Biedronka like-for-like performance in the year was slightly negative at minus 0.8%. Throughout the second semester, there was an improvement of the volumes on a like-for-like basis, more expressive in Q4, which reinforces our confidence for 2015.\r\nBiedronka total sales grew 9.5%, reaching in 2014 EUR 8.4 billion. The banner led the market share increases in Poland and ended 2014 with a total market share of 16.9%, 1.1 percentage points more than in the previous year. Market share gains were stronger in the last 2 quarters of the year.\r\nIn Portugal, food retail sales evolution remain on negative ground during the year, and the consumer remained very price-sensitive. Pingo Doce led the market share gains in the sector and ended the year with a market share of 18.2%, 0.6 percentage points more than in 2013.\r\nThe volume growth on a like-for-like basis more than offset the effects of the internal deflation, and allowed the company to post 1.2% growth in its like-for-like sales in value, excluding fuel. Total sales grew 1.7% to total of EUR 3.2 billion, the company having added 5 new stores to its network, of which 4 are managed by third parties.\r\nRecheio continues to operate in a tough environment for both HoReCa and traditional retail. Despite sales in the year declining by 0.7%, volumes were positive at 1.5%, and the company invested in commercial actions to protect its sales and strengthen its client base. \r\nJust a few words on the new businesses. Ara had a good year executing the established brand. 50 stores were opened, and we already started preparing the next region to be operating in the second half of 2015.\r\nThe management team in Colombia acknowledges that throughout 2014 gained important insights on the local consumer as well as on the fundamentals of our business in its markets. Hebe's team focused on further developing its expertise on the beauty sector.\r\nGroup EBITDA was 0.2%, of which generated by Biedronka. The EBITDA decline reflects the deflation in Poland and Portugal, the intense price investment in both markets and increase in the startup losses from Ara and Hebe. The losses from the new businesses impacted the group's EBITDA by EUR 58 million, EUR 16 million more than in 2013.\r\nGroup EBITDA margin was 5.8%, 80 bps below previous year. Biedronka's EBITDA margin was 6.8%, 100 bps below previous year. This performance mainly reflects the impact of minus 1.8 basket deflation at the top line and a 3% inflation at the cost structure, which did not allow the dilution of costs in sales.\r\nDespite being positive, volume growth in the company was not enough to offset this effect.\r\nPingo Doce delivered strong volume growth, which together with strict cost management, compensated the impacts of the internal basket deflation. The company's EBITDA margin was at 5.8%, in line with previous year. Recheio margin declined, resulted from the investment in commercial actions and the impact from deflation on cost dilution. The consolidating investment program that amounted to EUR 470 million focused on expansion, this being easily understood by the relevant opportunities we have in such a fragmented market as Poland, and also because of our new venture in Colombia, where we are just starting to build our market positions. Investment in our current store base is also strategic to protect productivity and continue to provide a good shopping experience to our consumer.\r\nThis nature of investment represented 25% of total CapEx. Finally, one of the key areas in our cost advantage is our logistic infrastructure. In 2014, we opened 5 new distribution centers, 3 of which in Biedronka. Pingo Doce began the restructuring of its logistic infrastructure with the opening of one DC in Southern Portugal, and Hebe has a new and fully fit warehouse. In 2014, the CapEx in the new businesses amounted to EUR 43 million, 65% of which was invested in Ara, mainly on the opening of 50 new stores. Up till now, all our stores in Colombia are rented.\r\nFor 2015, food deflation should continue to impact the sector, at least in the first half of the year. Promotions are also expected to continue to play a relevant role during this year.\r\nWe will maintain our focus on top line growth through the opening of new stores, but particularly by improving productivity in the current store network. In what regards organic expansion, our plan will be focused in our 2 growth markets, Poland and Colombia. This expansion investment is part of the total CapEx program estimated to be between EUR 500 million and EUR 550 million for this year.\r\nIn what concerns productivity of the current networks, the main priority will be to implement the measures to improve Biedronka's offer. The company will be focused on its sale booster program throughout the year. Biedronka will also work on adjusting its cost structure to become better fit to operate in a low-inflation scenario and in accordance with the new pace of expansion. We, hence, confirm the EBITDA margin floor to Biedronka at 6.5% for 2015, as announced in Biedronka's Day. Pingo Doce will continue strengthening its relationship with the consumer to keep growing sales and gaining market share. For Ara, 2015 is the year to validate the model in a different region while continuing to develop the key pillars of our offer to the Colombian consumer. EBITDA losses from the new businesses are expected in the range of EUR 60 million to EUR 70 million in 2015. I would close this presentation by saying that we feel confident on the foundations we are building to deliver the growth potential we clearly see in Poland and in Colombia. And as we enter 2015, we are fully committed in taking the most out of our Biedronka operation, including our presence in the big urban centers in Poland with a selected expansion, while reinforcing the innovation in our value proposition.\r\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your attention, and I am now ready to take your questions.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Ana Luísa Virgínia (Executives)】\nLadies and gentlemen, the conference will now begin with Mr. Pedro Soares dos Santos, Chairman of Jerónimo Martins Group. Mr. Pedro Soares dos Santos, you have the floor.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Pedro Dos Santos (Executives)】\nLadies and gentlemen, good morning, and thank you for joining this call to present Jerónimo team's full-year results. 2014 was not a business as usual year, neither for the food retail sector nor for our Jerónimo teams. Food deflation hit Portugal and Poland harder than we expected, forcing our companies to find new strategies and tactics to manage in a tougher environment. Despite all the challenge, our main business outperformed their respective markets and post positive like-for-like sales in volumes. This means that our capacity to track and retain consumers was reinforced during the year. All in all, we ended 2015 stronger and better prepared to face the future.\r\nWe delivered in our main objects of growing sales ahead of the market where we operate and manage to have EUR 851 million to our consolidated sales that increased to EUR 12.7 billion.\r\nTotal sales were very much support by expansion, mainly in Poland, where Biedronka opened 211 new stores. Year -- in a year of strategic review of the whole value proposition, Biedronka decide to implement a sales booster program to regain like-for-like sales more. And there are already signs in line with what we expected. At the same time, the company is adjusting the pace of expansion to more selected criteria in terms of new locations.\r\nBiedronka's present network scale, both stores and distribution centers, allow us to keep growing at a different region without compromising our target to reach the 3,000 store check. Still, Biedronka benefited from the large share of the group CapEx in 2014, EUR 361 million, and will continue to be our main priority in terms of investments in 2015 and in the coming years.\r\nAs we expect food deflation to continue in Poland in 2015, Biedronka will have to be very strict in terms of cost discipline while focused on reinforcing innovation in its offer to make sure it takes most of it out of the current store network. In 2014, Biedronka's contribution to the group's EBITDA increased to 78%, stressing its rule of our main growth and profitability drive. The combination of deflation at the top line with inflation at the cost level, mainly in wage and rent sales, negatively impacts Biedronka's EBITDA margin and, as a consequence, the group's profits.\r\nDespite extra pressure at all fronts, Jerónimo's teams increased by 41% its cash flow generation to EUR 267 million. The strong consolidated pro forma results also in those proven capacity outperformed its market. Strong cash flow generation combined with a solid balance sheet create the necessary conditions for the group to continue investing in its future growth.\r\nAs we approach the end of our second full year of operations in Colombia, I do believe that Ara will play an increasing important role in our portfolio and further expansion plans. This year, we will test our business model in a very different region of the country, which we will provide that with value strategic insight as we go forward.\r\nBecause -- before giving the floor, 2014 allow solid -- does not reflect our full potential to deliver, although solid does not reflect our full potential to deliver. After incorporation 2014 learnings, it's now time for us to execute at our best level in all the countries.\r\nThank you, once again, for your attention. I'll now leave you with Ana Luísa.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Ana Luísa Virgínia (Executives)】\nThank you, Mr. Pedro Soares dos Santos. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you again for joining the call. I will start by bringing you some context to the year. In Poland, GDP and private consumption remain stable. The pressure came from food deflation. Debt, as seen in other European markets, accelerated along the year, particularly in the second half, reaching minus 0.9% in the year, which compares with food inflation of plus 2% in 2013. In Portugal, the food retail market remained under pressure in an enduring difficult environment. Food deflation was at minus 1.3% in the year, with higher levels in Q2 and Q3 and sometimes [ph] a slowdown towards the year-end.\r\nThis environment brought one further challenge to our performance. We were surprised by much higher than expected levels of food deflation, both in Poland and in Portugal. We believe that we should not manage against deflation, and we did not, as this would risk our competitive position. Therefore, our profitability was impacted by the imbalance between top line deflation and cost inflation. Managing in this deflationary environment, our main companies are becoming stricter on their cost structures to protect profitability.\r\n2014 was also marked by Biedronka's strategic review. Our biggest company took the year to identify opportunities to grow not only organically, but mainly in the current selling area, a plan to take the full potential from the existing stores we've built and is now being implemented. In this context, group sales grew 7.2% to EUR 12.7 billion, with reinforcement of the competitive position of all our banners. Food deflation, already mentioned, together with very competitive market realities, pressured EBITDA and net results, which declined 5.6% and 21.1%, respectively. Despite the pressure on profitability, the strong cash flow generated by our own main business, Biedronka and Pingo Doce, more than compensated the startup investments.\r\nNet debt stood at EUR 273 million with gearing at 16.7%, an extremely solid financial situation. Despite all the challenges, there were key achievements in the year that allowed us to reinforce our competitive position. First, all our banners focused on sales growth and market share increase, and delivered positively on these objectives.\r\nBiedronka, Pingo Doce sales grew ahead of their respective markets and increased market shares, ending the year with a stronger competitive position. To deliver on these objectives, there were 2 fields of action, like-for-like performance and organic expansion program. For Biedronka, the store opening program was the main driver of the 1.1-percentage-point market share increase in the year. Our Polish company has, in terms of like-for-like performance, 2 difficult quarters in the beginning of the year. Nevertheless, volume performance on a like-for-like base improved in Q3 and Q4. Pingo Doce's performance was driven by the like-for-like growth, and the company gained 0.6 percentage points of market share, reaching 18.2% by the year-end.\r\nThe second achievement, strong cash flow generation. In 2014, the group generated a cash flow of EUR 267 million, EUR 78 million more than 2013, although it kept investing in business to guarantee future growth. And despite the pressure of deflation on profitability and the evolution of losses from the new businesses, pretax ROIC was at a healthy 21%. Regarding the income statement for the fourth quarter of the year, I highlight the following. Top line grew 7%, supported by expansion and positive volume performance of Biedronka and Pingo Doce. Total margin went from 21.7% to 21.3%, reflecting the commercial developments in the different businesses.\r\nThe increased weight of the operating costs from 15.2% to 15.7% of sales, mainly resulting from the imbalance between food deflation at the top line and cost inflation, impacting the capacity to dilute operating cost. At the EBITDA level, the losses from Ara and Hebe were EUR 15 million in the quarter. As a consequence, EBITDA margin was 100 basis points lower than previous years. The profit in associated companies was down from EUR 5 million in Q4 2013 to EUR 1 million in Q4 2014. Worth mentioning that in Q4 '13, this having benefited from a one-off income, the underlying figure being similar in the 2 periods.\r\nMinority interests were at minus EUR 4.6 million in the quarter. And I recall that in Q4 '13 figure was impacted by negative one-off items affecting Pingo Doce's results.\r\nLooking now to the income statement of the year, I would highlight the EBITDA margin decline of 80 bps, strongly impacted by the deleveraging effect of deflation that in the case of Biedronka was not offset by the volumes growth. The financial expenses, which were EUR 34 million, EUR 4.5 million below previous year, mainly due to the improvement of the average cost of debt, which in 2014 was at 3.7%.\r\nNon-recurrence were at EUR 9 million incorporating several different items as indemnities, some impairments and contingencies. And effective tax rate increased from 22.9% to 25.1% mainly due to the increase of the wage and value of losses in the new businesses.\r\nMoving now to the cash flow statement. The free cash flow was EUR 267 million, EUR 78 million more than in 2013 already after CapEx payments of EUR 486 million. This performance reflects the real strengths of our businesses, and is the result of a solid operating performance despite all challenges and a strict management of the working capital that remains the key area of efficiency in our businesses. Also contributing to the cash generated was the decrease in the CapEx payments following the slowdown in Biedronka's expansion. The strength of the balance sheets was reinforced, and net debt was reduced by EUR 73 million, ending the year at EUR 273 million. Net debt to EBITDA was at 0.4 and interest covered at 13x, with a gearing of 16.7%, clearly reflecting a solid financial position for the group. In line with the established dividend policy, the Board of Directors will propose on the General Shareholders Meeting of April 9, a growth dividend of EUR 0.245 per share, representing a dividend yield of 2.24% over the average share price registered in 2014.\r\nI will now go into a more detailed analysis of our businesses' performance starting with the group. Group sales increased EUR 851 million to EUR 12.7 billion, a growth of 7.2%. The negative internal basket inflation in Biedronka, Pingo Doce and Recheio impacted the group's like-for-like growth that was slightly negative at minus 0.4%, a word to the fact that the group like-for-likes following Biedronka and Pingo Doce's solid performance improved in the last quarter of the year and was positive at plus 0.6%. The sales of Ara and Hebe reached EUR 152 million and increased EUR 72 million related to 2013, including the exchange rates impact.\r\nIn the business areas, I will start with Biedronka that during 2014, and always guided by the mission of putting consumer satisfaction in preference at the center of all these decisions work mainly on 2 priorities. One, improved sales density, opportunities to improve its offer and, hence, to grow share of wallet were identified. And the company ended 2014 with a clear plan to uplift its sales density to be implemented throughout 2015. Two, reinforce its presence in the markets. To guarantee that the company continues to grab the potential identified in the market, 211 new stores were opened and 3 new distribution centers were built to support expansion and efficiency.\r\nWhen analyzing the sales performance, we need to start by saying that food inflation deteriorated very fast, impacting our internal basket deflation that was at minus 1.8% for the year. Biedronka like-for-like performance in the year was slightly negative at minus 0.8%. Throughout the second semester, there was an improvement of the volumes on a like-for-like basis, more expressive in Q4, which reinforces our confidence for 2015.\r\nBiedronka total sales grew 9.5%, reaching in 2014 EUR 8.4 billion. The banner led the market share increases in Poland and ended 2014 with a total market share of 16.9%, 1.1 percentage points more than in the previous year. Market share gains were stronger in the last 2 quarters of the year.\r\nIn Portugal, food retail sales evolution remain on negative ground during the year, and the consumer remained very price-sensitive. Pingo Doce led the market share gains in the sector and ended the year with a market share of 18.2%, 0.6 percentage points more than in 2013.\r\nThe volume growth on a like-for-like basis more than offset the effects of the internal deflation, and allowed the company to post 1.2% growth in its like-for-like sales in value, excluding fuel. Total sales grew 1.7% to total of EUR 3.2 billion, the company having added 5 new stores to its network, of which 4 are managed by third parties.\r\nRecheio continues to operate in a tough environment for both HoReCa and traditional retail. Despite sales in the year declining by 0.7%, volumes were positive at 1.5%, and the company invested in commercial actions to protect its sales and strengthen its client base. \r\nJust a few words on the new businesses. Ara had a good year executing the established brand. 50 stores were opened, and we already started preparing the next region to be operating in the second half of 2015.\r\nThe management team in Colombia acknowledges that throughout 2014 gained important insights on the local consumer as well as on the fundamentals of our business in its markets. Hebe's team focused on further developing its expertise on the beauty sector.\r\nGroup EBITDA was 0.2%, of which generated by Biedronka. The EBITDA decline reflects the deflation in Poland and Portugal, the intense price investment in both markets and increase in the startup losses from Ara and Hebe. The losses from the new businesses impacted the group's EBITDA by EUR 58 million, EUR 16 million more than in 2013.\r\nGroup EBITDA margin was 5.8%, 80 bps below previous year. Biedronka's EBITDA margin was 6.8%, 100 bps below previous year. This performance mainly reflects the impact of minus 1.8 basket deflation at the top line and a 3% inflation at the cost structure, which did not allow the dilution of costs in sales.\r\nDespite being positive, volume growth in the company was not enough to offset this effect.\r\nPingo Doce delivered strong volume growth, which together with strict cost management, compensated the impacts of the internal basket deflation. The company's EBITDA margin was at 5.8%, in line with previous year. Recheio margin declined, resulted from the investment in commercial actions and the impact from deflation on cost dilution. The consolidating investment program that amounted to EUR 470 million focused on expansion, this being easily understood by the relevant opportunities we have in such a fragmented market as Poland, and also because of our new venture in Colombia, where we are just starting to build our market positions. Investment in our current store base is also strategic to protect productivity and continue to provide a good shopping experience to our consumer.\r\nThis nature of investment represented 25% of total CapEx. Finally, one of the key areas in our cost advantage is our logistic infrastructure. In 2014, we opened 5 new distribution centers, 3 of which in Biedronka. Pingo Doce began the restructuring of its logistic infrastructure with the opening of one DC in Southern Portugal, and Hebe has a new and fully fit warehouse. In 2014, the CapEx in the new businesses amounted to EUR 43 million, 65% of which was invested in Ara, mainly on the opening of 50 new stores. Up till now, all our stores in Colombia are rented.\r\nFor 2015, food deflation should continue to impact the sector, at least in the first half of the year. Promotions are also expected to continue to play a relevant role during this year.\r\nWe will maintain our focus on top line growth through the opening of new stores, but particularly by improving productivity in the current store network. In what regards organic expansion, our plan will be focused in our 2 growth markets, Poland and Colombia. This expansion investment is part of the total CapEx program estimated to be between EUR 500 million and EUR 550 million for this year.\r\nIn what concerns productivity of the current networks, the main priority will be to implement the measures to improve Biedronka's offer. The company will be focused on its sale booster program throughout the year. Biedronka will also work on adjusting its cost structure to become better fit to operate in a low-inflation scenario and in accordance with the new pace of expansion. We, hence, confirm the EBITDA margin floor to Biedronka at 6.5% for 2015, as announced in Biedronka's Day. Pingo Doce will continue strengthening its relationship with the consumer to keep growing sales and gaining market share. For Ara, 2015 is the year to validate the model in a different region while continuing to develop the key pillars of our offer to the Colombian consumer. EBITDA losses from the new businesses are expected in the range of EUR 60 million to EUR 70 million in 2015. I would close this presentation by saying that we feel confident on the foundations we are building to deliver the growth potential we clearly see in Poland and in Colombia. And as we enter 2015, we are fully committed in taking the most out of our Biedronka operation, including our presence in the big urban centers in Poland with a selected expansion, while reinforcing the innovation in our value proposition.\r\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your attention, and I am now ready to take your questions.",
      "transcript_text3": "I have 4 questions. First one, could you please give us some color about the competitive environment in Poland? Who is the most aggressive player for now? Second question, how many stores in Poland do offer new assortments? And within those stores, what is the level already reached in new assortments? Third question, when do you intend to reach bottom in terms of margin in Poland? Can we expect recovery from Q2 or Q3? And finally, concerning startup losses, 2015 will be a peak or shall we expect further increase in 2016?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you, Emmanuelle. So in what regards competitive environment in Poland, we don't see big changes. In fact, as we said, it continues -- we have a different set of players. It continues to be very competitive and very promotion-driven, but no big evolution. And so in terms of players, the only thing that we can say, of course, is that we -- highly regard all our competitors including the proximity format. But really, there are no novelties in that area. In terms of the new assortments, as we said in the Biedronka's Day, what we will do is that we will be progressively increasing the assortments in the chain and making the adjustments. So this is a process that will go throughout the year and, in a sense, it will go, as we said, gradually. In terms of the EBITDA, I have to clarify that we will not be working for the bottom target that we gave, of course. This is just to make you confident that although we know that we are playing in a very tough environment, we think that we will be able to manage -- even being very competitive, we will be able to manage our cost structure to make sure that the EBITDA will not fall below the 6.5%. But of course, we will be working to be or to cap it at a higher level. In what concerns losses, so there is an increase estimated for 2015. And in 2016, I don't think we -- it will depend, of course, on Ara and the way that we will progress. So I would put it at a rough estimate at the same levels at least at this point.\n\n---\n\nSo 3 questions for me, the first one related to that 6.5% margin floor that you provided. There's been a deterioration of deflation since you guided to that. Could you just let us know what sort of like-for-likes do you think you need to be able to not to reach that level? And what sort of cost-cutting are you assuming that you are going to achieve to reach the -- to avoid reaching the 6.5%? That's my first question. My second question relates to Portugal. I would like to know whether the -- have you seen any signs of changes in the competitive backdrop in Portugal? There has been a significant reduction of deflationary pressures. Has this led to any change in the promotional intensity or in the markets already or not? And my third question relates again, sorry, to go back to Biedronka, a little bit on the whole lot of the new commercial offer to your stores. Could you confirm that you expect to have that concluded in Q2? And could you just give us some visibility on what sort of uplifts in store sales are you having in those stores, where you already concluded the upgrade of the commercial offer?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you, Filipe. So regarding the 6.5% margin floor, it's true that we are seeing a deterioration of deflation. But as you -- as we already mentioned, this is contrary. 2014 is not a surprise to us. Since the very beginning that we said that we were considering that 2015 would still be a deflationary environment in Poland, particularly in the first semester. So this time, we believe that we are ready to face it at least because we have the learnings from 2014. And in this sense, not only we are working at the top level and implementing the needed measures, but also in our cost structure. So in this sense, as I already mentioned, we will be working to a higher level of EBITDA, but we provided for the 6.5%. Yes, would you ...\n\n---\n\nJust because the average rate from 2014 is much weaker than 30 basis points throughout in 2015. So there must be some sort of improvement you are assuming or significant improvement. So could you just let us know what sort of like-for-likes would be the minimum for you to be able to achieve that floor or to avoid that floor? And what is the sort of cost-cutting you are assuming that you can achieve? Because otherwise, again, there is a margin drop in the second half that still needs to roll out to 2015.\n\n---\n\nFilipe, as our chairman said, we are seeing the first signs according to what we expected, particularly in Poland. So we feel quite comfortable. But as you can imagine, we cannot give you much more color and put the numbers. But we feel quite positive in this start to the year. And in what concerns Portugal, I -- we sincerely do not see a very different environment. The market condition is very tough and very promotionally driven. It's a question of looking at our stores and not only at our stores. So I think that despite the reduction overall of deflation in average terms, it's going to be maintained very competitive, and the consumer will remain very price-sensitive. From a consumer point of view, we don't see any major change and any major trade-up in our stores, which means that at least in what food is related, it will continue to be very competitive. In what concerns Biedronka and the rollouts, so we don't think -- this is a very complex -- because, of course, when you speak of improving the offer and having a plan to uplift sales, we already mentioned that it's going to be gradual. And in this sense, we don't think it's going to be something that it can be closed in Q2. But we will be progressively introducing this improvement in the offer and the adjustment in the offer to adjust to the consumer needs in Poland. And in this sense, of course, we expect to have, as we've said, to gain a like-for-like momentum, and of course, to break this disruption that there were in Poland with a negative like-for-like pressure.\n\n---\n\nA couple of quick questions from me, please. Would you be happy to split the level of losses between Ara and Hebe expected for 2015? That's the first one. And secondly, just on CapEx, could you just put a bit of context behind the EUR 500 million to EUR 550 million group guidance for this year versus the EUR 700 million to EUR 800 million Poland target that you set at the trip last year for the 3 years ahead, please?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you, Charlotte. So in what concerns the losses for 2015, we are assuming basically that Ara will increase its weight a little bit. So it's going to be around 60% or slightly above, and Hebe probably below the 14%. In what concerns the CapEx, of course, the target that we gave for Biedronka was for the 3-year period. The EUR 500 million to EUR 550 million, we already said that Poland will, of course, take the most out of it. But we also have to consider that even in Portugal and in Colombia, we will be investing. So I can -- I think that you can assume that, of course, Biedronka will take around 60% of this CapEx. But the remaining, as I said, was for Portugal, for logistics and new store, then some refurbishments, and in Colombia for the expansion with the second region.\n\n---\n\nThree questions for me, please. The first one is could you give some more details on the planned cost-saving measures that you've got planned in Poland? The second question is when do you expect breakeven in Colombia? Is that 1 or 2 years off or a bit further out? The third question is could you tell us the revenues in Colombia and also the selling space in square meters at the end of the year?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you, James. So in what concerns Poland, I believe that you -- I think that we didn't -- we were quite clear in the Biedronka's Day. Basically, we are focusing on 2 main areas, as we said. One is that we are being much more selective in terms of expansions, and the second one is that we are working and adjusting our offer to the Polish consumer. This means basically to not only -- this is the simplest, of course, is the enlargement of the assortment. But it's not only enlargement of the assortment, it's really adjusting it and having it even or considering to have some differences for the urban consumers because we think that really there is a lot of potential in terms of increase that we can grab in our stores. In what concerns breakeven of Colombia, sorry, but we believe that it's too early for us to say. We have just started the operation. In fact, it's 2 years now on the 13th of March. And of course, it's going to be crucial to see how it will work in the second region before we can say anything about, really, the breakeven of the business because we need really to see how it works, and we need to really understand the fundamentals of the business in a country like Latin America, which is not easy. But as I usually say, I think that we will break even sooner than we did in Biedronka, which took us almost 10 years, that you can be sure. In what concerns revenues, so sales in 2014 were EUR 66 million. And in terms of selling area, we are now with 28,000 square meters in our total network.\n\n---\n\nJust a very quick question regarding the stores with the new format in Poland. Maybe can you provide a figure of how many stores have been already revamped with the new format? And how many of them are you expecting to reform during the year? And I don't know, maybe not another specific like-for-like figure, but could you provide any indication of the uplift in sales in the already reformed stores?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you, Juan. So this is -- I must say, I don't know if there is any missing cents [ph], but we are not having a new format. So we maintain and we speak to our business model in Biedronka. What we announced in Biedronka's Day was that we would consider an adjustment in our offer mainly by...\n\n---\n\nYes, he was curious then. So...\n\n---\n\nExactly. And not only that...\n\n---\n\nThe awarding was not the most upper bit. So it's just the EBITDA format.\n\n---\n\nOkay, but I think understood your question. So I think that during the year, of course, we will be -- so this is -- this uplift or this change in the offer, as we said, is going to be gradual. So we are not making a big revolution in the stores that you can manage. It's going to be -- so the introduction, the testing of the products to see if they rotate or not, this is something that's going to be progressive. What we feel is that throughout the year, so in 2015, we will have the adjusted offer. At least most of it will be already implemented. So this is something that -- so you can see already some assortment increase in the stores. But overall -- and some layout changes. But this, as I said, is going to be progressive. In what concerns the uplift in sales, I think that we cannot tell you more than we already did. We have very positive sign in the beginning of the year, but we cannot disclose more than that.\n\n---\n\nSorry, I was late on the call. So apologies if my question was already asked, but could you just elaborate a bit on the unique economics of your existing stores in Colombia? For example, for the stores which have been opened for more than a year, if you could give us a sense of maybe what are the sales densities? How do they compare with your local peers as far as you can tell? And what are the store level EBITDA margin? And also related to that, if you could just give us a rough sense of how the like-for-like sales over the past 12 months have evolved for these stores you had opened in 2013?\n\n---\n\nThank you, Edouard. We understand, so -- and so nobody asked a question to elaborate on the economics of Colombia. But it's true also that we flagged it a little bit early to be very detailed about it because, of course, as we are starting from scratch, and as you can imagine, all the like-for-likes will be huge because we are starting from the beginning. And so in terms of the stores, we basically, as we said, we have now EUR 66 million in sales and 28,000 square meters in the total network. It was the only question answered to James and to everybody. And -- but in terms of sales per square meter or EBITDA margin, I think it's really too soon to say it as we are fine-tuning everything. So we are looking at our offer. We are seeing how we work with suppliers. I believe that the only thing that we can anticipate to you is that we are already working with negative working capital in Colombia, which was for us a very good surprise because it's not that easy in Latin America, and particularly in Colombia, with all the geographic constraints in terms of the logistic supply chain moves. So basically, we feel very optimistic about our operation. We are really going for the neighborhood stores format, but testing and seeing different formats once -- so basically, most of the stores that were opened this year have less than 300 square meters. But also, we are testing some more with an enlargement in terms of the assortment. But it's too soon to elaborate more about this. I think that throughout the year, we'll give you a little bit more color on Colombia and probably on the Colombian market, but at this stage, it's quite soon.\n\n---\n\nThree questions for me, please. First one, November Investor Day, you mentioned there'd be no way you'd make your 6.5% margin if deflation stayed where it was. I think the reported food deflation number then was minus 1.9%. Just a quick question whether you still maintain this view? And if so, what are your deflation assumptions for FY '15? If you can give those, that'd be great. Secondly, on CapEx, guidance is EUR 500 million to EUR 550 million for FY '15. You've mentioned 60% to be for Biedronka. If you apply that same rate for 3 years, that get you to EUR 945 million for Biedronka with a 3-year period. I'm guessing that's not how you're looking at it given you're still maintaining your EUR 700 million to EUR 800 million guidance you gave at Investor Day. But if you could talk around that dynamic, that will be great. And lastly, mentioning gradually regaining like-for-like momentum, just any comment you can give on range change at the moment in terms of uplift? I know you haven't mentioned in terms of new stores you've refreshed, but any color you can give around what you've done here in terms of maybe non-food or anything will be great\n\n---\n\nOkay. So in terms of the 6.5%, I apologize, Charlie, but I think that there was a misunderstanding. Our idea, of course, we said that we were assuming a certain level of deflation, but our idea to give you that floor was already considering that deflation would deteriorate, particularly in the first half. And of course, we are comparing with the period where there was still some inflation, although low, in Poland. So by providing the floor, we will really be working not to go below that. It's really what we will be working not only as we introduce our measures in the -- in terms of sales and to boost sales and, of course, to maintain our margin, but also, as I've said, on our cost structure. So it's really, we maintain this floor for the level of deflation that we are seeing at this point, which are higher than, of course, last year. In what considers the CapEx for Biedronka, of course, if we do this kind of accounts, we believe that in 2015, this will be, of course, a little bit more than in the next couple of years, as we are revamping the stores. And we are adjusting those not only -- so not only in the normal revamping program and refurbishment of the stores, but also in terms of adjusting layouts, if needed, to comply with this improvement and this different offer that we have to adjust. So basically, we keep the same guidance for the 3-year periods. In what concerns sales momentum, I believe that you were talking about Poland, right?\n\n---\n\nYes, exactly. Yes, right.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So again, I think that the only thing that we can say is about -- we're feeling quite positive with what is happening in -- with this gradual improvement in the offer, but we cannot disclose any more.\n\n---\n\nJust a quick one. You've had very strong cash flow for the year, but the dividend was down 20%. Just wanted to see if there'll always be a strict 45% to 50% payout policy for the dividend or if there would ever be any flexibility on this?\n\n---\n\nGeorgios, I apologize, but the line was -- I hear you very badly. I think that you -- what I understood from the question, if I can repeat, you wanted me to confirm the payout ratio for the future?\n\n---\n\nYes, if there would ever be any flexibility on that?\n\n---\n\nOkay. So basically, as you could see from our release, we are maintaining the payout ratio in Jerónimo Martins despite the decline in result because basically -- because we feel that the opportunities to grow and to invest despite this year, that was not according to our full expectations. We think that these will not change. So basically, we do not see any reason for the moment to change our dividend policy and our dividend payout ratio.\n\n---\n\nI have 3 questions. Firstly, on the CapEx guidance, what's primarily driving the increase in 2015? Is it Colombia? And if it is, could you give an idea of how many stores you're planning to open and the same for distribution centers, and whether it's freehold or leasehold so I can understand why there's a big step-up there? Secondly, can I just check, you're not opening any distribution centers this year on Poland? And finally, you're reducing new space in Poland at the same time some of your competitors are accelerating store openings, particularly in the proximity format. Do you think that will be a challenge in terms of the level at which you can outperform the market? And in that context, do you think margins are likely to rise again for Biedronka?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you, Sherri. So in what concerns CapEx guidance, I think the fact that we are increasing some of the CapEx this time, it's really related to our refurbishment and our revamping programs. Because as we stated, we are going to try to take the most out of our current networks. So in Poland and also in Portugal, we are -- that we are assuming that there will be a lot of lift-ups in Pingo Doce. So basically, for Colombia, we do not expect major differences in terms of CapEx, and we are assuming that at least or around 60 stores will be opened in Colombia. So there is only -- in 2015, we only are expecting to have one new region. So it's the Caribbean coasts that we mentioned in our release. So basically, it has to do with that. But the remaining guidance for the rest of the period is along these lines considering that 2015 will be the year that has most of the CapEx stake. In what concerns the DCs, what we feel is that in Poland, the infrastructure in place is enough to cope with the next or this new pace of expansion and also to cope with really this offer adjustment. As we said, we have everything ready to have an increasing assortment, an adjusted assortment to urban and nonurban. So the DCs that we have make us feel comfortable that for the next couple of years, we will probably need one more, but not much more than that. So we think that in place, we have the infrastructure that is needed to continue serving the stores in a very efficient and competitive way. And in what concerns the acceleration of competitors in Poland, we don't see those signs really. I think that the -- even all the other competitors are slightly slowing down. From the numbers that we have, basically the only hypermarket chain that is opening stores is Kaufland. And in the proximity parts, what we see is Carrefour opening on proximity, basically with or requiring to third parties to operate the stores. And we are seeing some conversion of traditional retailers into franchise-type chains. But really, there is not really an acceleration. I think it's more a conversion of the stores that we'll consider as traditional retail. And I'm now working under organized banners like Carrefour or any others.\n\n---\n\nI have a couple of questions. The first one, sorry if I missed this one, I got on to the call a little late. What are your expectations for losses at Ara and Hebe next year? And second one is in terms of the format that you plan to open in the second region in Colombia, is that similar to what you currently had, the neighborhood one, in the first region?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you, Krishna. So in terms of the losses for Ara and Hebe in 2015, it's going to be -- so for Ara, we'll have the largest take of the losses, of course, as we go and enter this new region. It's going to be above 60% more or less of the losses that we are considering, and Ara -- and Hebe will have the remaining. As for the format in Colombia, so we are assuming that there will be no big change. Of course, we have to go a little bit and know a little bit better the regions, but we are assuming that we will continue with the neighborhood store. The only thing that we have to see is if the store is to have the 200 square meters or it's much more on the 400s or on the 600. But in what concerns the type of format, it's always going to be a proximity format. So we are assuming that we want to be a neighborhood-organized store, but very much our main competitors will be, for sure, the traditional retailers in Colombia.\n\n---\n\nAnd one quick follow-up, what's the absolute amount of losses that you're expecting for Ara and Hebe?\n\n---\n\nThe amount, we -- what we have in our release, EUR 60 million to EUR 70 million.\n\n---\n\nI'm not sure if this question was already made, but on working capital, so that working capital improved substantially throughout the year. I think it was decline, it was declining in terms of days of sales by 4 days in the first half and end of the year with one day of deterioration. What was the reason for this evolution? And how do you expect working capital as a percentage of sales to evolve going forward? Should this be flat from the level that we saw at the end of '14? That's my first question. And second question on price perception in Poland. Obviously, it has been evolving, and what do you expect the current price cap [indiscernible] competitors? And also how this has been evolving -- have been increasing or not? And the third one, in terms of consolidation in Poland, any signs of further consolidation moves in this market?\n\n---\n\nThank you, José. So in what concerns the working capital improvement, I must say that, of course, the working capital depends a lot on the dynamics of the business, as you know. So this is quite seasonal. I think that in this particular quarter, we have to assume that we even compared, as Christmas in this case, played very much in our favor from 2013. So this makes all the difference in terms of the stock levels and of the supplier's level with which you end the year. So I think that we -- I believe that we can assume really that the average is the best numbers that we can play with because it's, of course, as being seasonal in the quarter, it will have to pay, of course, to our suppliers that were much higher than last year. And this will evolve in a certain way. But one thing is for sure, we will, as you know from our trend in the past, we highly regard working capitals, and we think it's one of the things that we must be very attentive to. And so we will try, of course, to improve. Although we know that there are some limitations considering that we have a lot of promotions, but we don't expect any deterioration average-wise in working capital. In what concerns price perception in Poland, of course, we announced in November that we thought we should increase the gap to our consumer -- to our competitors in Poland because with the offer that we have, being efficient as we are, we have the space to do it without jeopardizing our margin mix. And so we will be acting on that. There were some evolutions. I think that we can see that. But on average, I would believe that the gaps were capped. But we will be working to be more competitive even in our previous assortment, as we mentioned in the Biedronka's Day. In what regards consolidations in Poland, really, we didn't see any. So there are some stores that were changed or -- but very small operations and no big consolidation moves at the moment. And as we also mentioned in the past, we believe that the antitrust authorities in Poland are quite strict in what considers appreciating or looking at this kind of moves. And they look really into formats, not to the whole organized retail, and this makes quite difficult for big consolidation moves.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Thank you very much for having attended our conference calls, and I hope to remain in touch. If you have any questions or detailed questions that you want to see clarified, please report to our investor relations office. And thank you very much. Have a good day.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Emmanuelle Vigneron (Analysts)】\nI have 4 questions. First one, could you please give us some color about the competitive environment in Poland? Who is the most aggressive player for now? Second question, how many stores in Poland do offer new assortments? And within those stores, what is the level already reached in new assortments? Third question, when do you intend to reach bottom in terms of margin in Poland? Can we expect recovery from Q2 or Q3? And finally, concerning startup losses, 2015 will be a peak or shall we expect further increase in 2016?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ana Luísa Virgínia (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you, Emmanuelle. So in what regards competitive environment in Poland, we don't see big changes. In fact, as we said, it continues -- we have a different set of players. It continues to be very competitive and very promotion-driven, but no big evolution. And so in terms of players, the only thing that we can say, of course, is that we -- highly regard all our competitors including the proximity format. But really, there are no novelties in that area. In terms of the new assortments, as we said in the Biedronka's Day, what we will do is that we will be progressively increasing the assortments in the chain and making the adjustments. So this is a process that will go throughout the year and, in a sense, it will go, as we said, gradually. In terms of the EBITDA, I have to clarify that we will not be working for the bottom target that we gave, of course. This is just to make you confident that although we know that we are playing in a very tough environment, we think that we will be able to manage -- even being very competitive, we will be able to manage our cost structure to make sure that the EBITDA will not fall below the 6.5%. But of course, we will be working to be or to cap it at a higher level. In what concerns losses, so there is an increase estimated for 2015. And in 2016, I don't think we -- it will depend, of course, on Ara and the way that we will progress. So I would put it at a rough estimate at the same levels at least at this point.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Filipe Rosa (Analysts)】\nSo 3 questions for me, the first one related to that 6.5% margin floor that you provided. There's been a deterioration of deflation since you guided to that. Could you just let us know what sort of like-for-likes do you think you need to be able to not to reach that level? And what sort of cost-cutting are you assuming that you are going to achieve to reach the -- to avoid reaching the 6.5%? That's my first question. My second question relates to Portugal. I would like to know whether the -- have you seen any signs of changes in the competitive backdrop in Portugal? There has been a significant reduction of deflationary pressures. Has this led to any change in the promotional intensity or in the markets already or not? And my third question relates again, sorry, to go back to Biedronka, a little bit on the whole lot of the new commercial offer to your stores. Could you confirm that you expect to have that concluded in Q2? And could you just give us some visibility on what sort of uplifts in store sales are you having in those stores, where you already concluded the upgrade of the commercial offer?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ana Luísa Virgínia (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you, Filipe. So regarding the 6.5% margin floor, it's true that we are seeing a deterioration of deflation. But as you -- as we already mentioned, this is contrary. 2014 is not a surprise to us. Since the very beginning that we said that we were considering that 2015 would still be a deflationary environment in Poland, particularly in the first semester. So this time, we believe that we are ready to face it at least because we have the learnings from 2014. And in this sense, not only we are working at the top level and implementing the needed measures, but also in our cost structure. So in this sense, as I already mentioned, we will be working to a higher level of EBITDA, but we provided for the 6.5%. Yes, would you ...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Filipe Rosa (Analysts)】\nJust because the average rate from 2014 is much weaker than 30 basis points throughout in 2015. So there must be some sort of improvement you are assuming or significant improvement. So could you just let us know what sort of like-for-likes would be the minimum for you to be able to achieve that floor or to avoid that floor? And what is the sort of cost-cutting you are assuming that you can achieve? Because otherwise, again, there is a margin drop in the second half that still needs to roll out to 2015.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ana Luísa Virgínia (Executives)】\nFilipe, as our chairman said, we are seeing the first signs according to what we expected, particularly in Poland. So we feel quite comfortable. But as you can imagine, we cannot give you much more color and put the numbers. But we feel quite positive in this start to the year. And in what concerns Portugal, I -- we sincerely do not see a very different environment. The market condition is very tough and very promotionally driven. It's a question of looking at our stores and not only at our stores. So I think that despite the reduction overall of deflation in average terms, it's going to be maintained very competitive, and the consumer will remain very price-sensitive. From a consumer point of view, we don't see any major change and any major trade-up in our stores, which means that at least in what food is related, it will continue to be very competitive. In what concerns Biedronka and the rollouts, so we don't think -- this is a very complex -- because, of course, when you speak of improving the offer and having a plan to uplift sales, we already mentioned that it's going to be gradual. And in this sense, we don't think it's going to be something that it can be closed in Q2. But we will be progressively introducing this improvement in the offer and the adjustment in the offer to adjust to the consumer needs in Poland. And in this sense, of course, we expect to have, as we've said, to gain a like-for-like momentum, and of course, to break this disruption that there were in Poland with a negative like-for-like pressure.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlotte Edgar (Analysts)】\nA couple of quick questions from me, please. Would you be happy to split the level of losses between Ara and Hebe expected for 2015? That's the first one. And secondly, just on CapEx, could you just put a bit of context behind the EUR 500 million to EUR 550 million group guidance for this year versus the EUR 700 million to EUR 800 million Poland target that you set at the trip last year for the 3 years ahead, please?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ana Luísa Virgínia (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you, Charlotte. So in what concerns the losses for 2015, we are assuming basically that Ara will increase its weight a little bit. So it's going to be around 60% or slightly above, and Hebe probably below the 14%. In what concerns the CapEx, of course, the target that we gave for Biedronka was for the 3-year period. The EUR 500 million to EUR 550 million, we already said that Poland will, of course, take the most out of it. But we also have to consider that even in Portugal and in Colombia, we will be investing. So I can -- I think that you can assume that, of course, Biedronka will take around 60% of this CapEx. But the remaining, as I said, was for Portugal, for logistics and new store, then some refurbishments, and in Colombia for the expansion with the second region.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Tracey (Analysts)】\nThree questions for me, please. The first one is could you give some more details on the planned cost-saving measures that you've got planned in Poland? The second question is when do you expect breakeven in Colombia? Is that 1 or 2 years off or a bit further out? The third question is could you tell us the revenues in Colombia and also the selling space in square meters at the end of the year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ana Luísa Virgínia (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you, James. So in what concerns Poland, I believe that you -- I think that we didn't -- we were quite clear in the Biedronka's Day. Basically, we are focusing on 2 main areas, as we said. One is that we are being much more selective in terms of expansions, and the second one is that we are working and adjusting our offer to the Polish consumer. This means basically to not only -- this is the simplest, of course, is the enlargement of the assortment. But it's not only enlargement of the assortment, it's really adjusting it and having it even or considering to have some differences for the urban consumers because we think that really there is a lot of potential in terms of increase that we can grab in our stores. In what concerns breakeven of Colombia, sorry, but we believe that it's too early for us to say. We have just started the operation. In fact, it's 2 years now on the 13th of March. And of course, it's going to be crucial to see how it will work in the second region before we can say anything about, really, the breakeven of the business because we need really to see how it works, and we need to really understand the fundamentals of the business in a country like Latin America, which is not easy. But as I usually say, I think that we will break even sooner than we did in Biedronka, which took us almost 10 years, that you can be sure. In what concerns revenues, so sales in 2014 were EUR 66 million. And in terms of selling area, we are now with 28,000 square meters in our total network.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Juan Ros Padilla (Analysts)】\nJust a very quick question regarding the stores with the new format in Poland. Maybe can you provide a figure of how many stores have been already revamped with the new format? And how many of them are you expecting to reform during the year? And I don't know, maybe not another specific like-for-like figure, but could you provide any indication of the uplift in sales in the already reformed stores?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ana Luísa Virgínia (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you, Juan. So this is -- I must say, I don't know if there is any missing cents [ph], but we are not having a new format. So we maintain and we speak to our business model in Biedronka. What we announced in Biedronka's Day was that we would consider an adjustment in our offer mainly by...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pedro Dos Santos (Executives)】\nYes, he was curious then. So...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ana Luísa Virgínia (Executives)】\nExactly. And not only that...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Juan Ros Padilla (Analysts)】\nThe awarding was not the most upper bit. So it's just the EBITDA format.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ana Luísa Virgínia (Executives)】\nOkay, but I think understood your question. So I think that during the year, of course, we will be -- so this is -- this uplift or this change in the offer, as we said, is going to be gradual. So we are not making a big revolution in the stores that you can manage. It's going to be -- so the introduction, the testing of the products to see if they rotate or not, this is something that's going to be progressive. What we feel is that throughout the year, so in 2015, we will have the adjusted offer. At least most of it will be already implemented. So this is something that -- so you can see already some assortment increase in the stores. But overall -- and some layout changes. But this, as I said, is going to be progressive. In what concerns the uplift in sales, I think that we cannot tell you more than we already did. We have very positive sign in the beginning of the year, but we cannot disclose more than that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Edouard Aubin (Analysts)】\nSorry, I was late on the call. So apologies if my question was already asked, but could you just elaborate a bit on the unique economics of your existing stores in Colombia? For example, for the stores which have been opened for more than a year, if you could give us a sense of maybe what are the sales densities? How do they compare with your local peers as far as you can tell? And what are the store level EBITDA margin? And also related to that, if you could just give us a rough sense of how the like-for-like sales over the past 12 months have evolved for these stores you had opened in 2013?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ana Luísa Virgínia (Executives)】\nThank you, Edouard. We understand, so -- and so nobody asked a question to elaborate on the economics of Colombia. But it's true also that we flagged it a little bit early to be very detailed about it because, of course, as we are starting from scratch, and as you can imagine, all the like-for-likes will be huge because we are starting from the beginning. And so in terms of the stores, we basically, as we said, we have now EUR 66 million in sales and 28,000 square meters in the total network. It was the only question answered to James and to everybody. And -- but in terms of sales per square meter or EBITDA margin, I think it's really too soon to say it as we are fine-tuning everything. So we are looking at our offer. We are seeing how we work with suppliers. I believe that the only thing that we can anticipate to you is that we are already working with negative working capital in Colombia, which was for us a very good surprise because it's not that easy in Latin America, and particularly in Colombia, with all the geographic constraints in terms of the logistic supply chain moves. So basically, we feel very optimistic about our operation. We are really going for the neighborhood stores format, but testing and seeing different formats once -- so basically, most of the stores that were opened this year have less than 300 square meters. But also, we are testing some more with an enlargement in terms of the assortment. But it's too soon to elaborate more about this. I think that throughout the year, we'll give you a little bit more color on Colombia and probably on the Colombian market, but at this stage, it's quite soon.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Storey (Analysts)】\nThree questions for me, please. First one, November Investor Day, you mentioned there'd be no way you'd make your 6.5% margin if deflation stayed where it was. I think the reported food deflation number then was minus 1.9%. Just a quick question whether you still maintain this view? And if so, what are your deflation assumptions for FY '15? If you can give those, that'd be great. Secondly, on CapEx, guidance is EUR 500 million to EUR 550 million for FY '15. You've mentioned 60% to be for Biedronka. If you apply that same rate for 3 years, that get you to EUR 945 million for Biedronka with a 3-year period. I'm guessing that's not how you're looking at it given you're still maintaining your EUR 700 million to EUR 800 million guidance you gave at Investor Day. But if you could talk around that dynamic, that will be great. And lastly, mentioning gradually regaining like-for-like momentum, just any comment you can give on range change at the moment in terms of uplift? I know you haven't mentioned in terms of new stores you've refreshed, but any color you can give around what you've done here in terms of maybe non-food or anything will be great\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ana Luísa Virgínia (Executives)】\nOkay. So in terms of the 6.5%, I apologize, Charlie, but I think that there was a misunderstanding. Our idea, of course, we said that we were assuming a certain level of deflation, but our idea to give you that floor was already considering that deflation would deteriorate, particularly in the first half. And of course, we are comparing with the period where there was still some inflation, although low, in Poland. So by providing the floor, we will really be working not to go below that. It's really what we will be working not only as we introduce our measures in the -- in terms of sales and to boost sales and, of course, to maintain our margin, but also, as I've said, on our cost structure. So it's really, we maintain this floor for the level of deflation that we are seeing at this point, which are higher than, of course, last year. In what considers the CapEx for Biedronka, of course, if we do this kind of accounts, we believe that in 2015, this will be, of course, a little bit more than in the next couple of years, as we are revamping the stores. And we are adjusting those not only -- so not only in the normal revamping program and refurbishment of the stores, but also in terms of adjusting layouts, if needed, to comply with this improvement and this different offer that we have to adjust. So basically, we keep the same guidance for the 3-year periods. In what concerns sales momentum, I believe that you were talking about Poland, right?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charlie Storey (Analysts)】\nYes, exactly. Yes, right.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ana Luísa Virgínia (Executives)】\nOkay. So again, I think that the only thing that we can say is about -- we're feeling quite positive with what is happening in -- with this gradual improvement in the offer, but we cannot disclose any more.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Georgios Pilakoutas (Analysts)】\nJust a quick one. You've had very strong cash flow for the year, but the dividend was down 20%. Just wanted to see if there'll always be a strict 45% to 50% payout policy for the dividend or if there would ever be any flexibility on this?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ana Luísa Virgínia (Executives)】\nGeorgios, I apologize, but the line was -- I hear you very badly. I think that you -- what I understood from the question, if I can repeat, you wanted me to confirm the payout ratio for the future?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Georgios Pilakoutas (Analysts)】\nYes, if there would ever be any flexibility on that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ana Luísa Virgínia (Executives)】\nOkay. So basically, as you could see from our release, we are maintaining the payout ratio in Jerónimo Martins despite the decline in result because basically -- because we feel that the opportunities to grow and to invest despite this year, that was not according to our full expectations. We think that these will not change. So basically, we do not see any reason for the moment to change our dividend policy and our dividend payout ratio.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Sherri Malek (Analysts)】\nI have 3 questions. Firstly, on the CapEx guidance, what's primarily driving the increase in 2015? Is it Colombia? And if it is, could you give an idea of how many stores you're planning to open and the same for distribution centers, and whether it's freehold or leasehold so I can understand why there's a big step-up there? Secondly, can I just check, you're not opening any distribution centers this year on Poland? And finally, you're reducing new space in Poland at the same time some of your competitors are accelerating store openings, particularly in the proximity format. Do you think that will be a challenge in terms of the level at which you can outperform the market? And in that context, do you think margins are likely to rise again for Biedronka?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ana Luísa Virgínia (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you, Sherri. So in what concerns CapEx guidance, I think the fact that we are increasing some of the CapEx this time, it's really related to our refurbishment and our revamping programs. Because as we stated, we are going to try to take the most out of our current networks. So in Poland and also in Portugal, we are -- that we are assuming that there will be a lot of lift-ups in Pingo Doce. So basically, for Colombia, we do not expect major differences in terms of CapEx, and we are assuming that at least or around 60 stores will be opened in Colombia. So there is only -- in 2015, we only are expecting to have one new region. So it's the Caribbean coasts that we mentioned in our release. So basically, it has to do with that. But the remaining guidance for the rest of the period is along these lines considering that 2015 will be the year that has most of the CapEx stake. In what concerns the DCs, what we feel is that in Poland, the infrastructure in place is enough to cope with the next or this new pace of expansion and also to cope with really this offer adjustment. As we said, we have everything ready to have an increasing assortment, an adjusted assortment to urban and nonurban. So the DCs that we have make us feel comfortable that for the next couple of years, we will probably need one more, but not much more than that. So we think that in place, we have the infrastructure that is needed to continue serving the stores in a very efficient and competitive way. And in what concerns the acceleration of competitors in Poland, we don't see those signs really. I think that the -- even all the other competitors are slightly slowing down. From the numbers that we have, basically the only hypermarket chain that is opening stores is Kaufland. And in the proximity parts, what we see is Carrefour opening on proximity, basically with or requiring to third parties to operate the stores. And we are seeing some conversion of traditional retailers into franchise-type chains. But really, there is not really an acceleration. I think it's more a conversion of the stores that we'll consider as traditional retail. And I'm now working under organized banners like Carrefour or any others.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Krishna Arikatla (Analysts)】\nI have a couple of questions. The first one, sorry if I missed this one, I got on to the call a little late. What are your expectations for losses at Ara and Hebe next year? And second one is in terms of the format that you plan to open in the second region in Colombia, is that similar to what you currently had, the neighborhood one, in the first region?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ana Luísa Virgínia (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you, Krishna. So in terms of the losses for Ara and Hebe in 2015, it's going to be -- so for Ara, we'll have the largest take of the losses, of course, as we go and enter this new region. It's going to be above 60% more or less of the losses that we are considering, and Ara -- and Hebe will have the remaining. As for the format in Colombia, so we are assuming that there will be no big change. Of course, we have to go a little bit and know a little bit better the regions, but we are assuming that we will continue with the neighborhood store. The only thing that we have to see is if the store is to have the 200 square meters or it's much more on the 400s or on the 600. But in what concerns the type of format, it's always going to be a proximity format. So we are assuming that we want to be a neighborhood-organized store, but very much our main competitors will be, for sure, the traditional retailers in Colombia.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Krishna Arikatla (Analysts)】\nAnd one quick follow-up, what's the absolute amount of losses that you're expecting for Ara and Hebe?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ana Luísa Virgínia (Executives)】\nThe amount, we -- what we have in our release, EUR 60 million to EUR 70 million.\n\n---\n\n【質問: José Rito (Analysts)】\nI'm not sure if this question was already made, but on working capital, so that working capital improved substantially throughout the year. I think it was decline, it was declining in terms of days of sales by 4 days in the first half and end of the year with one day of deterioration. What was the reason for this evolution? And how do you expect working capital as a percentage of sales to evolve going forward? Should this be flat from the level that we saw at the end of '14? That's my first question. And second question on price perception in Poland. Obviously, it has been evolving, and what do you expect the current price cap [indiscernible] competitors? And also how this has been evolving -- have been increasing or not? And the third one, in terms of consolidation in Poland, any signs of further consolidation moves in this market?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ana Luísa Virgínia (Executives)】\nThank you, José. So in what concerns the working capital improvement, I must say that, of course, the working capital depends a lot on the dynamics of the business, as you know. So this is quite seasonal. I think that in this particular quarter, we have to assume that we even compared, as Christmas in this case, played very much in our favor from 2013. So this makes all the difference in terms of the stock levels and of the supplier's level with which you end the year. So I think that we -- I believe that we can assume really that the average is the best numbers that we can play with because it's, of course, as being seasonal in the quarter, it will have to pay, of course, to our suppliers that were much higher than last year. And this will evolve in a certain way. But one thing is for sure, we will, as you know from our trend in the past, we highly regard working capitals, and we think it's one of the things that we must be very attentive to. And so we will try, of course, to improve. Although we know that there are some limitations considering that we have a lot of promotions, but we don't expect any deterioration average-wise in working capital. In what concerns price perception in Poland, of course, we announced in November that we thought we should increase the gap to our consumer -- to our competitors in Poland because with the offer that we have, being efficient as we are, we have the space to do it without jeopardizing our margin mix. And so we will be acting on that. There were some evolutions. I think that we can see that. But on average, I would believe that the gaps were capped. But we will be working to be more competitive even in our previous assortment, as we mentioned in the Biedronka's Day. In what regards consolidations in Poland, really, we didn't see any. So there are some stores that were changed or -- but very small operations and no big consolidation moves at the moment. And as we also mentioned in the past, we believe that the antitrust authorities in Poland are quite strict in what considers appreciating or looking at this kind of moves. And they look really into formats, not to the whole organized retail, and this makes quite difficult for big consolidation moves.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Ana Luísa Virgínia (Executives)】\nOkay. Thank you very much for having attended our conference calls, and I hope to remain in touch. If you have any questions or detailed questions that you want to see clarified, please report to our investor relations office. And thank you very much. Have a good day.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015, and overall, we are very pleased with the solid growth in sales and improved bottom line results. Our profitability remains driven by 3 fundamental elements: a broad assortment of products at compelling prices; an aggressive store network expansion strategy across Canada; and a focus on productivity and cost reduction initiatives that drive improved operating results. I will briefly go over the fiscal 2015 results and store expansion highlights, and Michael will provide you with a more detailed update on our financial and key operating initiatives for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 1, 2015. \r\nFrom a financial point of view, fiscal 2015 was an excellent year for Dollarama. We were able to deliver strong top line sales growth of 12.9% for the year. These sales were driven by continued expansion of our store network and strong same-store sales growth of 5.7%, including a strong performance in the fourth quarter as same-store sales increased by 8.5%.  We continue to generate strong margins through our compelling merchandise offering at truly great value. This year, our margin was 36.9% as we absorbed part of the headwinds related to the weak Canadian dollar, but benefited from the positive scaling effects of higher sales on occupancy costs as well as continued logistic efficiencies.  Our net earnings improved by 18% to $295 million in fiscal 2015, while diluted earnings per share increased by 27% to $2.21 per share. \r\nFrom a real estate point of view, we opened 9 -- 81 net new stores over the past 12 months compared to 89 net new openings in the same period last year, thereby increasing our total store count across Canada to 955 stores compared to 874 stores at the end of Q4 last year. The quality of available real estate, combined with our unique value proposition, has allowed us to reach out to our customer base to increase traffic to our stores and improve our store's economics. For fiscal 2016, we expect to keep up the same pace by opening another 70 to 80 net new stores, focusing on markets that remain underpenetrated by dollar stores. \r\nUp until now, we had disclosed publicly there was a potential for at least 1,200 Dollarama stores in Canada. We have now revised that number to 1,400. This is based on an update of our market analysis which takes into account the retail competitive landscape, the rates of per-capita store penetration and the performance of comparable and new stores. This estimate of 1,400 stores assumes a consistent store format and the same quality of real estate locations. Of course, as we get closer to the 1,400 stores, naturally, the cannibalization is expected to increase, which in turn will likely have an impact on our new store payback periods. The average capital payback period now of approximately 2 years could range between 2 and 3 years as we get closer to that number of stores, namely 1,400. \r\nNow from a merchandising point of view, our customers continue to respond positively to our product mix. Our sales for all major holidays, including Easter, Halloween and Christmas, were stronger this year than the prior year and will continue to update -- we will continue to update and diversify our product selection in order to sustain the healthy growth over the next year.  For additional information on such assumptions and risks -- not surprisingly, margins are under pressure as the Canadian dollar is weaker than it was 1 year ago. However, we have currency hedges in place to mitigate some of our adverse impact of foreign exchange-based fluctuations on merchandise costs. Our buyers are also working hard to ensure that we continue to offer a wide variety of products at price points that meet customers' expectations in terms of value. \r\nFinally, I would like to express my thanks to our management team and all of our dedicated employees that have contributed to the successes of this past fiscal year. Our employees make this company better and more successful every day, and I would like to thank them all. \r\nNow let me turn the call over to Michael.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. So I will briefly go through the fourth quarter results and some of our financial and operating initiatives. \r\nDuring the fourth quarter, we increased our sales by 14.9% to $669 million from $482.3 million prior year. The increase in sale was fueled by the opening of 81 net new stores in fiscal 2015 and the strong Q4 same-store sales. Same-store sales increased by 8.5%, consisting of a 4.7% increase in transaction size which reflects the consumer demand for our higher price point items and a 3.6% increase in the number of transactions primarily attributable to the positive impact of favorable weather conditions experienced during the holidays this year compared to last year. Same-store sales growth is -- in Q4 last year was only 1.1%. \r\nIn this quarter, 72% of our sales originated from products priced higher than $1 compared to 61% in the corresponding quarter last year. Debit card penetration also increased as 46% of sales were paid with debit cards compared to 43% in the corresponding period of previous fiscal year.  Our gross margin was 38.8% of sales compared to 38.4% of sales in Q4 last year. This improvement is primarily attributable to the positive scaling effect of higher sales on occupancy and logistics costs.  Our Q4 G&A as a percentage of sale was 16.1% compared to 15.9% last year. We continue to deliver savings related to labor productivity initiatives, but these were offset by timing of certain expenses incurred. \r\nMoving to the bottom line. Q4 net earnings increased to $100.3 million or $0.76 per diluted share compared to $83 million or $0.59 per diluted shares in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Cash flows from operations increased to $168 million in Q4 '15 from $120 million in Q4 '14. This mainly reflects improvement in financial results in the quarter.  During the quarter, we also repurchased 1.7 million shares for a consideration of $97.1 million. \r\nNow looking at our full year fiscal 2015 results, we are proud to say that we improved on all of our key metrics. Starting on the top line. As Larry mentioned earlier, sales increased by 12.9% to $2.3 billion. We achieved a 5.7% increase in same-store sales for the full year, fueled by a 4.2% increase in average transaction size and a 1.4% increase in the number of transactions. These were enhanced by the fourth quarter same-store sales increase of 8.5% as we benefited from strong Christmas sales and much better winter conditions during the holiday seasons at this year versus last year. \r\nOur gross margin decreased slightly to 36.9% from 37.1% last year as we absorbed some of the cost increases that relate primarily to the weakening Canadian dollar. We manage our margins by continually investing in the value proposition offered by our products. Looking forward to fiscal '16, we expect this trend to continue as we target a gross margin in the range of between 36% and 37% in order to stimulate continued sales growth. \r\nOur G&A expenses represented 17.1% of sales, which continued to improve as we benefited from labor productivity, cost containment initiative and disciplined execution. Overall, we are very satisfied with the progression of our G&A over the year as we achieved the lower end of the 17.1% to 17.5% range that we were targeting. Looking forward to fiscal '16, we expect to improve this ratio slightly as we continue to benefit from our productivity initiatives and the positive scaling impact of higher sales on fixed costs. EBITDA in fiscal '15 grew 14.5% to $461 million or 19.8% of sales compared to 19.5% of sales last year. And net earnings increased by 18% to $295 million from $250 million, while diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $2.21 from $1.74 last year. \r\nIn fiscal 2015, through our NCIB program, we bought back 9.3 million shares for a total of $436 million at a weighted average share price of $47.04 per share. In terms of 2014-2015 NCIB program, which started in June 2014, we have purchased 3.4 million shares of -- or 72% of the 4.7 million shares that we are authorized to buy back by June 2015. In addition, we invested over $85 million in capital expenditures to continue to expand the store network, renovate and refresh existing stores and enhance the store information technology infrastructure. Cash flow for the year was positive as we generated free cash flow from operations, net of capital expenditures, of $272 million in fiscal '15 compared to $202 million in fiscal 2014. \r\nProfits were higher this year. We improved our working capital position, and we incurred lower capital expenditures as the prior year included the major investments related to our new point-of-sales terminals. We continue to generate excess free cash flows well above our investment needs. Our healthy balance sheet and strong and improving free cash flow support our decision to increase the quarterly dividend by 12.5% to $0.09 per common share. Management favors a balanced approach between paying dividends and buying back shares to return value to shareholders. Therefore, the NCIB remains a viable option that will also be reviewed upon expiry of the current program in June 2015. \r\nNow let me give you an update with regards to our productivity initiatives. In fiscal 2014, we rolled out the Kronos advanced scheduling initiative in all our stores. Benefits were realized in fiscal 2015 as we fine-tuned the use of this tool, turned on additional features and gained more visibility on the labor metric to improve reporting. These reports have resulted in better labor scheduling at peak operating hours and have also improved our ability to manage seasonal fluctuations and labor hours to more efficiently match labor needs to sales volumes. \r\nIn fiscal 2014, we also rolled out our 4,500 new NCR point-of-sale terminals running on SAP retail platform in all our locations. This project has allowed us to implement additional in-store productivity initiatives and improve the customer service and eliminate non-value-added activities in the store. We now rely more on POS data than on information from manual inventory counts to drive inventory replenishment. This has improved our in-stock positions and reduced our labor hours related to counts in fiscal 2015. \r\nDollarama also upgraded its store IT infrastructure and plans to roll out, this fiscal year '16, Wi-Fi across its network to provide additional opportunities such as mobile scanning technology to improve conversion rates by reducing waiting times at the checkout and to reduce time spent taking inventory counts. Our goal is to continue to invest in high return initiatives that will enable us to be in a better in-stock position, optimize our in-store labor productivity, maximize warehousing capacity and generate logistic efficiencies. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of the company this year and the progress we made on the key initiatives that will support profitable growth in the future. \r\nThis now ends our formal remarks, and we can now take questions. Operator, I'll turn the call over to you.",

Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of the company this year and the progress we made on the key initiatives that will support profitable growth in the future. \r\nThis now ends our formal remarks, and we can now take questions. Operator, I'll turn the call over to you.",
      "transcript_text3": "On the subject of FX, on the Q3 call, you indicated that, yes, this is in fact something that you've faced before and it's something that you will have to deal with. But the dollar, of course, has continued to slide. So I was just wondering, other than the hedging that you have in place, if you could just walk through some of the initiatives that you have or the tools that you can use to help offset the gross margin pressure.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So you're right. The hedging this year obviously allowed us to offset a good portion of the headwinds. And also, we did absorb a part of that which impacted our gross margins going down. The other available alternative is -- comes from our ability when we refresh between 25% and 30%, that's still the case, of our offerings to manage the margin accordingly by introducing and having access, for example, which was the case this year, to higher price point items and so that we make sure that with the visibility that the buyers have, which includes the cost of the currency, to make sure we meet our margin target.\n\n---\n\nThat's very helpful. And just turning to the SG&A piece. You did note in the press release or in the MD&A that there was some timing on expenses in Q4. If you could just walk through that, what the nature was and the magnitude.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Well, one that impacted, that I think everyone will understand, is last year in Q4, because of the weather conditions and that we missed sales significantly, we had to adjust the incentive provision in Q4. So that means that you had to not only reduce the Q4 provision but correct the Q1, Q2, Q3 that were all recorded in the Q4. So that's an example of one timing amount. And then naturally, G&A, depending on the timing of projects that are incurred, and that's why in Q2 and Q3 of this year, I preannounced that we were investing some time and cost and efforts for Q3 and Q4 initiatives that we will see materializing in F '16 and F '17. And in the script this morning, I alluded to Wi-Fi. So that's kind of the next stage that will benefit -- give us benefits over the next 2, 3, 4 years. So it's the timing of certain expenses.\n\n---\n\nYes. That's great. And just one final one, if I may. In terms of the CapEx projects for 20 -- for F '16, anything -- are you going to be replacing the keypads this year?\n\n---\n\nThe PIN pads were all replaced this year, in fiscal '15. So in terms of hardware, I'd say, all of the heavy lifting is behind us, whether it's the NCR cash registers, PIN pad, Kronos machines. Then it becomes part of store opening costs with that equipment. And -- but coming down this year, it will be the Wi-Fi. So there is some hardware that's going to go in and some software also. And the aim here is to continue eliminating administrative -- as much of the administrative work and manual work that's done in-store to make the job more interesting, to make it more efficient and save cost all at the same time. And maybe, I expect you to follow up with what type of example. For instance, instead of doing the inventory with manually filling out the sheets, we could do it with scanners. And also, it's -- the risk of errors is reduced because as the scanner picks it up, it sends it through SAP to our system directly. As where before, we had to fill out the sheets, send it to a head office, enter it into a system, compare it to what the POS gave us to validate and then forward it. So it's initiatives like that where you do inventory counts, packaways and other manual work at the -- in the store that will be eliminated. It makes the job more interesting for our employees that work very hard every day. So that's just one of the examples.\n\n---\n\nI was just wondering how your stores are performing that are located near the Target locations and how you expect that to unfold over the next few months.\n\n---\n\nPerry, why did I think you'd ask that? I think at the moment, I would say that during the liquidation period, we'd be slightly negatively affected because dollars are going that way. I think the same thing happened during the Zellers liquidation. It's not very serious at all, but it's not positive, it's negative. Am I answering your question? I'd rather not continue...\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nYes, okay.\n\n---\n\nAnd related to sales, I'm just wondering how -- if you have any idea how being more in-stock has actually affected your sales line.\n\n---\n\nI wonder that every day. I have to think that being more in-stock, and that's the same case for every retailer in the world, the more in-stock you are and the more you have the product that the customer wants, that will impact positively on sales, no question about it. So my answer is, being in-stock is a good thing as a retailer. The right product at the right time. Yes, I'm sorry, Perry.\n\n---\n\nThat's okay. You've got another minimum wage increase coming up in Ontario. I was just wondering if you feel you can engineer enough efficiency to overcome that.\n\n---\n\nWe expect a...\n\n---\n\nYes, I think so.\n\n---\n\nIt's a small increase this year, so in the norm. So...\n\n---\n\nI'd appreciate it if you can talk to your friends at the -- in the Ontario government though and see what you can do about that.\n\n---\n\nYou're assuming that I have friends?\n\n---\n\nYes, I do.\n\n---\n\nJust -- okay. And just my last question, probably for Michael. You've had pretty good improvements in your working capital in the last couple years. Just wonder if you could talk about how you're managing that.\n\n---\n\nWell, a lot of that came through POS, the tools that we have and the management in-store. So we clearly benefited from that. A lot of the improvement you see in Q4 though -- well, a lot, yes. A good portion of it is timing also. So but if you talk more -- and it's a fact, over the past years, it has improved. And we have more visibility on the inventory. The planning has improved because we have more visibility on that. We are more just-in-time, for example, when goods are delivered, when we order them. The only little offset I said -- I'd say that we had in Q4, and we discussed that in prior calls, was the fact that we preordered inventory because of the duties impact. But other than that, for the rest, it's under control. And we work to continue improving it into the future. That should improve slightly over time as we continue using and actioning the functionalities of the tools we have.\n\n---\n\nIt's Emily Foo for Peter. So we've noticed that sales of the products priced over $1 was at 71.5%, which seem to be quite an increase both sequentially and year-over-year. Can you just talk a little bit about that and how that was achieved?\n\n---\n\nYes. The -- well, if you look at quarter-over-quarter, so it's as -- it's what you saw. Obviously, Q4 this year was much better than Q4 the year before. And the -- included were price points -- more price points in the $2.50, $3 range. And so all of that had an impact on the increase. The other thing too which helps is and I don't know which, well, I'm going to say, which come first, but it's a combination of both. Our debit transactions, as you know, are double that of a cash transaction. The penetration there also increased a bit more than usual. So I think the combination of that made it -- made this total go up.\n\n---\n\nI think I could add that from the time we introduced that multi-price of $2.50 and $3, that's the phenomena that's been happening. There's been more sales in the over-$1 price point when we went to multi-price. I think it's a combination of buyers doing a better job and getting used to that niche. The offering has been very good. And I think you'll continue to see less products at $1. Unfortunately, that's reality. I mean, you're reading it there as inflation continues to happen, as the dollar has its struggles. And the value we can offer at -- for the extra $0.25, to go from $1 to $1.25, is significant. I think at $1, we're struggling to get good value for the client today. Don't forget, we started off at $1.23 years ago, and we're 23 years later into that price point. So you're going to see some attrition at that level.\n\n---\n\nOkay. My second question is will you be providing an SG&A margin range for next fiscal year?\n\n---\n\nWell, at this time, we're comfortable in saying it will improve slightly. And as we move throughout the year like we've done in prior years, we'll give you a bit more visibility.\n\n---\n\nJust on your new store revised guidance. Where are you seeing most of these additional opportunities? Are they going to be out West? Ontario? Or are they relatively evenly spread?\n\n---\n\nEvenly spread.\n\n---\n\nI would confirm that. Again, we're going to open a bunch of stores in Québec and we're well-penetrated in Québec. So surprisingly so, but it is what it is, and I keep amazing myself and others that the stores are there to be opened. And if you put the stores where the people are, they will come. It doesn't mean we're not cannibalizing because if you have 2 stores in St-Hyacinthe, for example, and you put a third or a fourth, obviously, you're going to cannibalize but it's still worth opening the location.\n\n---\n\nOkay. That's great. And with the new store openings, I know we've talked about this a lot in the past, would they require or would that increase the need for a DC out West?\n\n---\n\nFor the moment, no, we're -- again, because we've improved efficiencies in Montreal over the periods where we're still pushing back the, if you want, the out West or reevaluating that. But for the time being, it's not something that we will trigger short term.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just one more, if I can. Just on the CapEx, with the new rollout of the mobile scanning and the Wi-Fi, what do you forecast CapEx at for 2016?\n\n---\n\nIt should -- the envelope should be a bit higher than this year. It's mid between this year and the prior year, so between $85 million and $100 million.\n\n---\n\nJust a few fast ones here. The EBIT margin in fiscal '15 was about -- slightly above 18%, and that's higher than, I think, the aspirational range in the 17% range. I understand there's variability from year to year, but I just wanted to get your thoughts on that EBIT margin target.\n\n---\n\nYes, the -- we're -- you're right. A good portion that brought it for -- from 17% to 17.8% was the amortization adjustment that we did at the beginning of the year in Q1 that we announced. So in other words, that same 17% goes up to 17.8%, so we finished a bit better than that. But I'd say it hovers around 17.8% to 18%. So that's kind of where we like that percentage. So any -- as we've said in the past, our aim is to generate G&A savings above the headwind, the G&A headwinds, enough to reinvest into the margin or the product offering, but keep that EBIT level where it is and just stimulate more sales at that level.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And then just wondering, when you decide on price points that you're going to implement in the store, increasing the maximum price point, does unfavorable currency factor in that decision?\n\n---\n\nWell, good question. If this continues to roll out in the same direction and we have a Canadian dollar at $1.30 and $1.35 and $1.40, the answer would probably be yes. We'll hold on as long as we can, but you're going to see some inflation, I would say, in Canada. Unavoidably, it's just going to happen. So I think the yes-or-no answer to your question would be yes.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just given the durability of the business model, I guess it continues to perform very well through challenging economic conditions, and given that the historical buyback has been a very good use of excess capital, would the company consider increasing leverage targets?\n\n---\n\nNo. When you say increasing, so, again, we're rated and the -- we want to maintain the 2 -- 3x adjusted debt-to-EBITDA or 2.5x depending on whether you use 8 as a factor or 6 as a factor. So we want to maintain our rating, so -- and we're close to that limit right now. So -- and that's our intention. So as we move up in time in the future, we're going to use our available cash flow to buy back and deleverage increase that our EBITDA -- increased EBITDA will give us to buy back. But we're, as you've seen, we're more conservative on the dividend, but share buyback is definitely our favorite way of returning value to our shareholders.\n\n---\n\nGot it. And just the last one here. In areas like Western Canada or in Alberta, where there's been negative pressure related to -- on the consumer related to energy price declines, does Dollarama feel a negative impact? Or does this feel a benefit as consumers try to maximize value?\n\n---\n\nI don't think we're feeling a negative impact at all. I'm waiting for the price of real estate to go down, but that's not happening either. So we're waiting in the wings.\n\n---\n\nJust a question on gasoline pricing, oil prices falling, and I know Vishal just alluded a bit to it. But with the gasoline prices falling, have you seen any a positive impact on demand in your stores, either regionally or nationally?\n\n---\n\nIt's hard to...\n\n---\n\nHow do you measure that and honestly, I would say no, but I can't measure that. You mean more disposable income, is it coming our way?\n\n---\n\nCorrect.\n\n---\n\nWell, I -- David...\n\n---\n\nThe numbers...\n\n---\n\nYou know how boring we are, David. So I don't know. I can't -- I'm not sure...\n\n---\n\nWell, there's been numbers circulating of the many billions of dollar available and -- for consumers and that they'd use that to spend. But to tell you the truth, we don't measure that specific to that dollar amount, so it's hard to say.\n\n---\n\nYes, I would agree with Michael there.\n\n---\n\nWell, how do you look at demand in 2016 fiscal year when you think about your budgeting process? You think about oil prices going down, you think about the potential impact on employment in Canada, do you make your guidance a lot more conservative? Or could you give us some idea of what you think the cadence of sales growth can be this year relative to normalized last year?\n\n---\n\nNo, we look at all those factors obviously. And so we -- and we look at historically how we've performed under these circumstances. Just in the last 5 years, you've had wide fluctuations, whether it was the currency, the inflation in China, the energy, like prices going up quickly and coming down now. So for us, yes, we do factor that, but otherwise, it's business as usual. Nothing structurally major changing around us that would have us re-question our model or our projections and direction.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And just back to the oil prices. As it relates to product procurement costs, is there -- how much of a natural hedge is there with falling oil prices in your product procurement costs of the Far East?\n\n---\n\nWell, product procurement. Well, when it's going up, you'll hear a lot about it, and when it's going down, you don't hear about it. And that's life. So I think it may have -- we're going to the Orient in about a month and we'll get it directly and confront them as you've just confronted us in the same way. But we're going to get the same answer. All of a sudden, oil is a very small part of a product -- of the product. And when it goes up, it's a huge part of the product. So we're going to hear that over and over again. And we're going to hear about the labor and we're going to hear about everything else that's offsetting those decreases in the buying of oil, the oil-based products. And there -- I think prices in the Orient, and namely in China, are stable. And it may be as a result, generally speaking, of the oil prices. It's hard to measure those things.\n\n---\n\nAnd again, I think with all the factors that were raised, we're all on the same-level playing field more or less. And as long as we keep in sync this in terms of value proposition and compelling this compared to our competitor, that's the model. And so you have to factor that also.\n\n---\n\nFair enough. Just on the tax rate, it was, I think, 26% in the quarter. Is that the level you expect it to be at next year? Or is it going to be a 27%?\n\n---\n\nNo. It's -- we're close to the statutory tax rate, which is 26.7%. We had a onetime refund there. So that's -- but the statutory rate, the rate that you should be using is closer to 26.7%, 27%.\n\n---\n\nOkay. That's helpful. And last question. Just on your distribution center in Montreal, I mean, it's, I guess, innately inefficient given pack sizes and so on. How do you get that to be more efficient now going forward? Is there much room there that makes a material benefit in future years? Or it is what it is for now?\n\n---\n\nWell, you have a distribution center of so many square feet. You keep putting more and more stores into that distribution center, you're going to lose some efficiency. We've expanded once. I don't think we can expand much more, but there's no question that, that inefficiency is worth absorbing compared to going elsewhere and opening another one. So yes, it's a little more inefficient because you're tighter and you're bumping into each other in the DC, in particular in the DC as opposed to the other warehouses that are strictly warehouses. So the DC is a little less efficient than ideally could be. But if you compare that to any other alternative, you'd be very happy with the -- I'm very happy with the results.\n\n---\n\nI just wanted to go back to items above $1. I just want to make sure I correctly understand that number. So it's a SKU or item count reference, right, when you talk about 71.5%, not a share of dollars, right?\n\n---\n\nA share of dollars.\n\n---\n\nShare of dollars. Okay.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nSo have you been able to take certain items from $1 to $1.25 to offset the FX impact, and that's part of what's going on here in terms of driving that rate up then?\n\n---\n\nI think the answer would be yes. We've taken some items from $1 to $1.25 as we've taken some items from $1.50 to $2. I guess we try and avoid that as much as possible. We'd rather cancel the item and buy something new. If we're going to do that, it's not our choice to mark up an item by 25% or more at all. So that's why we are absorbing as much as we can until we can no longer do so. But the preference again is to check out that item, cancel it and buy something new.\n\n---\n\nOkay. Just thinking about your new store program. Larry, I know this is kind of a conceptual vague question that may have an equally vague answer, but when you think about store saturation in the dollar store space in Canada, do you look at it like -- we all of sort of calculate it on a pop per 1,000 basis, but how do you guys approach it? Is it really sort of 1 store at a time assessed for viability in a geographic trading area? Or do you also keep an eye on sort of the macro which is store saturation?\n\n---\n\nThat's a good question. Look, I thought we were saturated in Québec when we opened our 100th store. We're almost 250 stores now. The model changes and the model affects how many stores you can eventually open. The model has changed over the last 20 years from one price point to this multi-price point. And it has allowed us to go into areas that we formerly would not have considered at the $1 price point. So the store penetration population is something we look at -- well, let's put it this way. I was in Ontario this week and I teased my guys there saying that we're better penetrated in Québec that in Ontario so you should get off your tushes and move a bit. So in that sense, I'll use it. But really, every city and every country, you can talk all you want, but trying to get penetration in Downtown Vancouver is just almost impossible. And there's a lot of people that live there. So every province is different. Every country is different. And it's tough to use that penetration other than to get people moving as the guideline, I think, it goes store-by-store, opportunity-by-opportunity. You look at it, and then you make a call. That's the way we do it anyways.\n\n---\n\nAnd as you've progressed on taking items above $1 up to a greater percentage of your business, has that also though allowed you to take on slightly higher rent expense and still make a good return?\n\n---\n\nI would think that, that is so.\n\n---\n\nYes, definitely.\n\n---\n\nWell, Michael is saying yes. So there you go.\n\n---\n\nMichael's obviously right.\n\n---\n\nHe is obviously right.\n\n---\n\nAnd last question. Just in the quarter, like obviously gross margin being up 25 basis points pre-rent was a very strong outcome. Was there any dynamic as a result of the prior year ice storm disruption that helped...\n\n---\n\nFor sure. I think in December last year, we were down 11% or something like that. It was ridiculously low. And...\n\n---\n\nYes. For December, it was minus 7.5%.\n\n---\n\nOkay, and this year?\n\n---\n\nAnd this year, yes, the transaction, if I recall, it was down 3.1% in Q4 last year. So it clearly had an impact this year.\n\n---\n\nYes. And the same thing is happening in the Maritimes right now, by the way, but this is February, it's not Christmas, thankfully.\n\n---\n\nYes. So then on gross margin rate though in the quarter, I assume that the negative impact on seasonal sales last year, which is a high margin category, would have potentially, this year, contributed to a gross margin recovery with less disruption.\n\n---\n\nIt's more the scaling, I'd say, that is the impact. So yes.\n\n---\n\nJust a question on the freight cost. I presume you're buying mostly FOB, the Orient. I'm wondering if you're saving significant amounts on freight at the moment?\n\n---\n\nAbsolutely not. Mike, please confirm that too.\n\n---\n\nYes, yes, yes. Yes, not significantly saving.\n\n---\n\nNo, we are not. No, there's not even -- never mind, you can remove the word \"significant.\"\n\n---\n\nThey are also greatly impacted by the demand, not just the cost of oil. And the demand is very high right now and so you're competing for the same boats, and so the freight industry is happy.\n\n---\n\nSo with the resurgence of the American economy, it more than offsets the gasoline price, unless you're a better negotiator of freight rates than we are.\n\n---\n\nYes, I expect not. And then just on the use of your POS systems, does that help reduce the packaway? Like does it help you forecast seasonal demand or is seasonal demand so volatile or variable that it's hard to reduce packaway with the systems?\n\n---\n\nWell, I guess it definitely gave us more information. Now instead of having 1 packaway for a season, we're able to split it in a more efficient way. But the other -- the savings I was alluding to before are in terms of when you change over seasons and you actually do the packaway, packing away will be quicker with the Wi-Fi application. And therefore, you have to have POS before, but now with the Wi-Fi to actually do the -- so you have time savings.\n\n---\n\nSo let me add to that. POS is putting more of the right stock into the right stores. So hopefully, our packaway will be less and less as time goes on because the ideal is to buy 100 dozen to a store and to be sold out with the last customer on December 24. And as POS gets more sophisticated, that's the goal. And it's improving every year, but we're far from there. And I'm looking forward to the day that we can sell out of Christmas, have no packaway and satisfy every single customer until 5:00 on December 24. And I repeat that every season, yes.\n\n---\n\nAnd just one question on the general preferential tariff that I guess we've been dealing with now over a few months. Before you'd said there wasn't much impact on your business, and I'm just wondering if that's still the view.\n\n---\n\nYes. Well, it had an impact, but not material in the sense that we said we would be able to manage it, which clearly we've done, and we'll continue to do. So it's just part of the headwinds that we deal with, but we're equipped to manage it like we're equipped to manage the currency, the energy cost inflation, the merchandising inflation and so on.\n\n---\n\nIt's not fun, but if you're -- we're talking about the duty rate increases here.\n\n---\n\nYes, yes, yes.\n\n---\n\nIf the duty goes up from 5% to 6.5%, well, you'll have that to deal with. But if the duty -- if there was no duty on, as an example...\n\n---\n\nPaint rollers.\n\n---\n\nOn paint rollers, as Neil will testify, go ahead.\n\n---\n\nAnd it goes up to 15.5%, well, then it's much less fun, as my father put it. So we have to find alternatives, other countries and other suppliers. And it's part of the buyer's job to find a way.\n\n---\n\nAnd so is it much of a percentage of the goods that are creating those problems? Or is it...\n\n---\n\nThankfully, it's not at all material.\n\n---\n\nYes. We name the 2 extremes. Well, 1 -- we name 1 extreme there.\n\n---\n\nYes, that's the most extreme.\n\n---\n\nYes, so buy your paintbrushes now.\n\n---\n\nPaint rollers.\n\n---\n\nPaint rollers now...\n\n---\n\nNot paintbrushes.\n\n---\n\nBefore that goes through the system at -- from Dollarama to Rona or wherever.\n\n---\n\nJust first question, the 1,400 store target you have, over what time frame is that -- do you expect that to be achieved?\n\n---\n\nI think it's safe to assume, we said 70 to 80 stores for F '16. In the future, I'd be -- I tend to say 60 stores per year-ish. So that's a 7 to -- 6 to 7 or 8 years of runway in front of us.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then for the F '16 stores, are all the locations pretty much locked in or -- that now you're looking at locations?\n\n---\n\nYes. They're pretty much locked in, yes.\n\n---\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\nPerfect. Okay. And I mean, let's just say if Walmart would announce tomorrow that they're going take over 50 of the Target locations in Canada, is that a concern for you? Or would it be a positive as it would drive more traffic to the shopping centers where there's [indiscernible]?\n\n---\n\nI think it would be a positive. I don't know if they're going to take 50, but you may be giving us some insight there. But any location that Walmart takes will drive a lot more traffic than, well, Zellers or unfortunately, Target was drawing. So I think it's positive.\n\n---\n\nAnd the assumption there is that the product mix obviously is different enough that there won't be a lot of overlap.\n\n---\n\nThere's very little overlap.\n\n---\n\nAnd Chris, as you know, we've got the experience of our current stores. So with -- which overlap with the 380 other Walmart stores in Canada. And again, these stores -- our stores perform very well.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then just in terms of your store traffic, it sounds like from the press release that you've excluded the impact of the ice storm. The traffic was roughly stable compared to the year-ago quarter. Is that right?\n\n---\n\nNo. It's -- well, this year, it was much more positive. Obviously, last year was negative 3.1%. This year was positive 3.6%. So the average of that is slightly positive.\n\n---\n\nAnd that's more or less in line with what you were expecting?\n\n---\n\nYes, yes.\n\n---\n\nI just want to go back to a couple of comments you made with respect to the penetration rate currently over 71% over $1 right now. You mentioned you have less opportunity items at $1. You've now had the $2.50 and $3 price points in for coming up on 3 years now. I'm wondering if you can just discuss your thoughts on potential to have an increase to the maximum price point of $3 right now. What goes into that and when you may need or consider implementing a higher price point?\n\n---\n\nWell, that's a good question I've been asking myself and we've been asking ourselves. I think it's going to depend a lot on the foreign exchange. There's only so much managing you can do. And it's happened very quickly. I'm getting calls from individuals who know me, what are we doing about that and how we're going to absorb that. And everybody in Canada has those concerns, and it's making retail in Canada a lot more difficult and a lot less fun. It's not fun to increase something. It's not fun to increase prices, period, especially how competitive everything is. And you don't know what your fellow retailer is doing or how he's handling it. So the speed at which this Canadian dollar has lost value is a concern to everybody, and we're going to have to look at it very quickly and soon. Just again, to take an item from $2 to $2.50 or $2.50 to $3 is not very, well, I'll use the word, fun. Now would that necessitate going above those price points? Not for now, we hope, but we have to fight very hard to -- we'd be able to say that going forward at a $1.30, $1.35 Canadian dollar, that we can maintain our price points without looking at them very carefully.\n\n---\n\nSo how far in advance do you have to make that decision prior to...\n\n---\n\nWell, I would say that as an example, I would say, 6 months to 1 year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And if you were to introduce a new price point, would you maintain the, say, 6 or 7 number of price points that you currently have offered and eliminate others? Or would you just add additional price points?\n\n---\n\nWell, now you're getting ahead of all of us here. I can't answer that question because I don't know the answer to it. I would like to eliminate some and add some if that's what we have to do, but I don't know. I can't answer that question.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And then very last question. Is there any update on the progress of what's going on down at Dollar City in terms of expansion or number of new stores or anything you can provide us on that front?\n\n---\n\nWell, there's, again, nothing material. No major change, but for us, it's going -- it's -- they're meeting expectations clearly, and so it's still very much alive.\n\n---\n\nMost of my questions have been answered, but just one more. Given all of the discussion we've been having on the call today, do you have any updated thoughts on credit cards and when you might move to accepting credit cards?\n\n---\n\nYes. No update, especially that the debit card continues to -- penetration continues to increase steadily and especially in the last quarter. So as long as that's very much alive, there's -- we'll continue with that and there's no intention to, at this point, to implement credit cards.\n\n---\n\nI agree with Michael 100%.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Irene Nattel (Analysts)】\nOn the subject of FX, on the Q3 call, you indicated that, yes, this is in fact something that you've faced before and it's something that you will have to deal with. But the dollar, of course, has continued to slide. So I was just wondering, other than the hedging that you have in place, if you could just walk through some of the initiatives that you have or the tools that you can use to help offset the gross margin pressure.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nOkay. So you're right. The hedging this year obviously allowed us to offset a good portion of the headwinds. And also, we did absorb a part of that which impacted our gross margins going down. The other available alternative is -- comes from our ability when we refresh between 25% and 30%, that's still the case, of our offerings to manage the margin accordingly by introducing and having access, for example, which was the case this year, to higher price point items and so that we make sure that with the visibility that the buyers have, which includes the cost of the currency, to make sure we meet our margin target.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Irene Nattel (Analysts)】\nThat's very helpful. And just turning to the SG&A piece. You did note in the press release or in the MD&A that there was some timing on expenses in Q4. If you could just walk through that, what the nature was and the magnitude.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nOkay. Well, one that impacted, that I think everyone will understand, is last year in Q4, because of the weather conditions and that we missed sales significantly, we had to adjust the incentive provision in Q4. So that means that you had to not only reduce the Q4 provision but correct the Q1, Q2, Q3 that were all recorded in the Q4. So that's an example of one timing amount. And then naturally, G&A, depending on the timing of projects that are incurred, and that's why in Q2 and Q3 of this year, I preannounced that we were investing some time and cost and efforts for Q3 and Q4 initiatives that we will see materializing in F '16 and F '17. And in the script this morning, I alluded to Wi-Fi. So that's kind of the next stage that will benefit -- give us benefits over the next 2, 3, 4 years. So it's the timing of certain expenses.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Irene Nattel (Analysts)】\nYes. That's great. And just one final one, if I may. In terms of the CapEx projects for 20 -- for F '16, anything -- are you going to be replacing the keypads this year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nThe PIN pads were all replaced this year, in fiscal '15. So in terms of hardware, I'd say, all of the heavy lifting is behind us, whether it's the NCR cash registers, PIN pad, Kronos machines. Then it becomes part of store opening costs with that equipment. And -- but coming down this year, it will be the Wi-Fi. So there is some hardware that's going to go in and some software also. And the aim here is to continue eliminating administrative -- as much of the administrative work and manual work that's done in-store to make the job more interesting, to make it more efficient and save cost all at the same time. And maybe, I expect you to follow up with what type of example. For instance, instead of doing the inventory with manually filling out the sheets, we could do it with scanners. And also, it's -- the risk of errors is reduced because as the scanner picks it up, it sends it through SAP to our system directly. As where before, we had to fill out the sheets, send it to a head office, enter it into a system, compare it to what the POS gave us to validate and then forward it. So it's initiatives like that where you do inventory counts, packaways and other manual work at the -- in the store that will be eliminated. It makes the job more interesting for our employees that work very hard every day. So that's just one of the examples.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nI was just wondering how your stores are performing that are located near the Target locations and how you expect that to unfold over the next few months.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nPerry, why did I think you'd ask that? I think at the moment, I would say that during the liquidation period, we'd be slightly negatively affected because dollars are going that way. I think the same thing happened during the Zellers liquidation. It's not very serious at all, but it's not positive, it's negative. Am I answering your question? I'd rather not continue...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes, okay.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nAnd related to sales, I'm just wondering how -- if you have any idea how being more in-stock has actually affected your sales line.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI wonder that every day. I have to think that being more in-stock, and that's the same case for every retailer in the world, the more in-stock you are and the more you have the product that the customer wants, that will impact positively on sales, no question about it. So my answer is, being in-stock is a good thing as a retailer. The right product at the right time. Yes, I'm sorry, Perry.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nThat's okay. You've got another minimum wage increase coming up in Ontario. I was just wondering if you feel you can engineer enough efficiency to overcome that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nWe expect a...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes, I think so.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nIt's a small increase this year, so in the norm. So...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI'd appreciate it if you can talk to your friends at the -- in the Ontario government though and see what you can do about that.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nYou're assuming that I have friends?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes, I do.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Perry Caicco (Analysts)】\nJust -- okay. And just my last question, probably for Michael. You've had pretty good improvements in your working capital in the last couple years. Just wonder if you could talk about how you're managing that.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nWell, a lot of that came through POS, the tools that we have and the management in-store. So we clearly benefited from that. A lot of the improvement you see in Q4 though -- well, a lot, yes. A good portion of it is timing also. So but if you talk more -- and it's a fact, over the past years, it has improved. And we have more visibility on the inventory. The planning has improved because we have more visibility on that. We are more just-in-time, for example, when goods are delivered, when we order them. The only little offset I said -- I'd say that we had in Q4, and we discussed that in prior calls, was the fact that we preordered inventory because of the duties impact. But other than that, for the rest, it's under control. And we work to continue improving it into the future. That should improve slightly over time as we continue using and actioning the functionalities of the tools we have.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Emily Foo (Analysts)】\nIt's Emily Foo for Peter. So we've noticed that sales of the products priced over $1 was at 71.5%, which seem to be quite an increase both sequentially and year-over-year. Can you just talk a little bit about that and how that was achieved?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. The -- well, if you look at quarter-over-quarter, so it's as -- it's what you saw. Obviously, Q4 this year was much better than Q4 the year before. And the -- included were price points -- more price points in the $2.50, $3 range. And so all of that had an impact on the increase. The other thing too which helps is and I don't know which, well, I'm going to say, which come first, but it's a combination of both. Our debit transactions, as you know, are double that of a cash transaction. The penetration there also increased a bit more than usual. So I think the combination of that made it -- made this total go up.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI think I could add that from the time we introduced that multi-price of $2.50 and $3, that's the phenomena that's been happening. There's been more sales in the over-$1 price point when we went to multi-price. I think it's a combination of buyers doing a better job and getting used to that niche. The offering has been very good. And I think you'll continue to see less products at $1. Unfortunately, that's reality. I mean, you're reading it there as inflation continues to happen, as the dollar has its struggles. And the value we can offer at -- for the extra $0.25, to go from $1 to $1.25, is significant. I think at $1, we're struggling to get good value for the client today. Don't forget, we started off at $1.23 years ago, and we're 23 years later into that price point. So you're going to see some attrition at that level.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Emily Foo (Analysts)】\nOkay. My second question is will you be providing an SG&A margin range for next fiscal year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nWell, at this time, we're comfortable in saying it will improve slightly. And as we move throughout the year like we've done in prior years, we'll give you a bit more visibility.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Derek Dley (Analysts)】\nJust on your new store revised guidance. Where are you seeing most of these additional opportunities? Are they going to be out West? Ontario? Or are they relatively evenly spread?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nEvenly spread.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI would confirm that. Again, we're going to open a bunch of stores in Québec and we're well-penetrated in Québec. So surprisingly so, but it is what it is, and I keep amazing myself and others that the stores are there to be opened. And if you put the stores where the people are, they will come. It doesn't mean we're not cannibalizing because if you have 2 stores in St-Hyacinthe, for example, and you put a third or a fourth, obviously, you're going to cannibalize but it's still worth opening the location.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Derek Dley (Analysts)】\nOkay. That's great. And with the new store openings, I know we've talked about this a lot in the past, would they require or would that increase the need for a DC out West?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nFor the moment, no, we're -- again, because we've improved efficiencies in Montreal over the periods where we're still pushing back the, if you want, the out West or reevaluating that. But for the time being, it's not something that we will trigger short term.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Derek Dley (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just one more, if I can. Just on the CapEx, with the new rollout of the mobile scanning and the Wi-Fi, what do you forecast CapEx at for 2016?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nIt should -- the envelope should be a bit higher than this year. It's mid between this year and the prior year, so between $85 million and $100 million.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vishal Shreedhar (Analysts)】\nJust a few fast ones here. The EBIT margin in fiscal '15 was about -- slightly above 18%, and that's higher than, I think, the aspirational range in the 17% range. I understand there's variability from year to year, but I just wanted to get your thoughts on that EBIT margin target.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes, the -- we're -- you're right. A good portion that brought it for -- from 17% to 17.8% was the amortization adjustment that we did at the beginning of the year in Q1 that we announced. So in other words, that same 17% goes up to 17.8%, so we finished a bit better than that. But I'd say it hovers around 17.8% to 18%. So that's kind of where we like that percentage. So any -- as we've said in the past, our aim is to generate G&A savings above the headwind, the G&A headwinds, enough to reinvest into the margin or the product offering, but keep that EBIT level where it is and just stimulate more sales at that level.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vishal Shreedhar (Analysts)】\nGot it. And then just wondering, when you decide on price points that you're going to implement in the store, increasing the maximum price point, does unfavorable currency factor in that decision?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWell, good question. If this continues to roll out in the same direction and we have a Canadian dollar at $1.30 and $1.35 and $1.40, the answer would probably be yes. We'll hold on as long as we can, but you're going to see some inflation, I would say, in Canada. Unavoidably, it's just going to happen. So I think the yes-or-no answer to your question would be yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vishal Shreedhar (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just given the durability of the business model, I guess it continues to perform very well through challenging economic conditions, and given that the historical buyback has been a very good use of excess capital, would the company consider increasing leverage targets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo. When you say increasing, so, again, we're rated and the -- we want to maintain the 2 -- 3x adjusted debt-to-EBITDA or 2.5x depending on whether you use 8 as a factor or 6 as a factor. So we want to maintain our rating, so -- and we're close to that limit right now. So -- and that's our intention. So as we move up in time in the future, we're going to use our available cash flow to buy back and deleverage increase that our EBITDA -- increased EBITDA will give us to buy back. But we're, as you've seen, we're more conservative on the dividend, but share buyback is definitely our favorite way of returning value to our shareholders.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Vishal Shreedhar (Analysts)】\nGot it. And just the last one here. In areas like Western Canada or in Alberta, where there's been negative pressure related to -- on the consumer related to energy price declines, does Dollarama feel a negative impact? Or does this feel a benefit as consumers try to maximize value?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI don't think we're feeling a negative impact at all. I'm waiting for the price of real estate to go down, but that's not happening either. So we're waiting in the wings.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nJust a question on gasoline pricing, oil prices falling, and I know Vishal just alluded a bit to it. But with the gasoline prices falling, have you seen any a positive impact on demand in your stores, either regionally or nationally?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nIt's hard to...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nHow do you measure that and honestly, I would say no, but I can't measure that. You mean more disposable income, is it coming our way?\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nCorrect.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWell, I -- David...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nThe numbers...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYou know how boring we are, David. So I don't know. I can't -- I'm not sure...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nWell, there's been numbers circulating of the many billions of dollar available and -- for consumers and that they'd use that to spend. But to tell you the truth, we don't measure that specific to that dollar amount, so it's hard to say.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes, I would agree with Michael there.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nWell, how do you look at demand in 2016 fiscal year when you think about your budgeting process? You think about oil prices going down, you think about the potential impact on employment in Canada, do you make your guidance a lot more conservative? Or could you give us some idea of what you think the cadence of sales growth can be this year relative to normalized last year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo, we look at all those factors obviously. And so we -- and we look at historically how we've performed under these circumstances. Just in the last 5 years, you've had wide fluctuations, whether it was the currency, the inflation in China, the energy, like prices going up quickly and coming down now. So for us, yes, we do factor that, but otherwise, it's business as usual. Nothing structurally major changing around us that would have us re-question our model or our projections and direction.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nOkay. And just back to the oil prices. As it relates to product procurement costs, is there -- how much of a natural hedge is there with falling oil prices in your product procurement costs of the Far East?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWell, product procurement. Well, when it's going up, you'll hear a lot about it, and when it's going down, you don't hear about it. And that's life. So I think it may have -- we're going to the Orient in about a month and we'll get it directly and confront them as you've just confronted us in the same way. But we're going to get the same answer. All of a sudden, oil is a very small part of a product -- of the product. And when it goes up, it's a huge part of the product. So we're going to hear that over and over again. And we're going to hear about the labor and we're going to hear about everything else that's offsetting those decreases in the buying of oil, the oil-based products. And there -- I think prices in the Orient, and namely in China, are stable. And it may be as a result, generally speaking, of the oil prices. It's hard to measure those things.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nAnd again, I think with all the factors that were raised, we're all on the same-level playing field more or less. And as long as we keep in sync this in terms of value proposition and compelling this compared to our competitor, that's the model. And so you have to factor that also.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nFair enough. Just on the tax rate, it was, I think, 26% in the quarter. Is that the level you expect it to be at next year? Or is it going to be a 27%?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo. It's -- we're close to the statutory tax rate, which is 26.7%. We had a onetime refund there. So that's -- but the statutory rate, the rate that you should be using is closer to 26.7%, 27%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: David Hartley (Analysts)】\nOkay. That's helpful. And last question. Just on your distribution center in Montreal, I mean, it's, I guess, innately inefficient given pack sizes and so on. How do you get that to be more efficient now going forward? Is there much room there that makes a material benefit in future years? Or it is what it is for now?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWell, you have a distribution center of so many square feet. You keep putting more and more stores into that distribution center, you're going to lose some efficiency. We've expanded once. I don't think we can expand much more, but there's no question that, that inefficiency is worth absorbing compared to going elsewhere and opening another one. So yes, it's a little more inefficient because you're tighter and you're bumping into each other in the DC, in particular in the DC as opposed to the other warehouses that are strictly warehouses. So the DC is a little less efficient than ideally could be. But if you compare that to any other alternative, you'd be very happy with the -- I'm very happy with the results.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nI just wanted to go back to items above $1. I just want to make sure I correctly understand that number. So it's a SKU or item count reference, right, when you talk about 71.5%, not a share of dollars, right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nA share of dollars.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nShare of dollars. Okay.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nSo have you been able to take certain items from $1 to $1.25 to offset the FX impact, and that's part of what's going on here in terms of driving that rate up then?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI think the answer would be yes. We've taken some items from $1 to $1.25 as we've taken some items from $1.50 to $2. I guess we try and avoid that as much as possible. We'd rather cancel the item and buy something new. If we're going to do that, it's not our choice to mark up an item by 25% or more at all. So that's why we are absorbing as much as we can until we can no longer do so. But the preference again is to check out that item, cancel it and buy something new.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nOkay. Just thinking about your new store program. Larry, I know this is kind of a conceptual vague question that may have an equally vague answer, but when you think about store saturation in the dollar store space in Canada, do you look at it like -- we all of sort of calculate it on a pop per 1,000 basis, but how do you guys approach it? Is it really sort of 1 store at a time assessed for viability in a geographic trading area? Or do you also keep an eye on sort of the macro which is store saturation?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nThat's a good question. Look, I thought we were saturated in Québec when we opened our 100th store. We're almost 250 stores now. The model changes and the model affects how many stores you can eventually open. The model has changed over the last 20 years from one price point to this multi-price point. And it has allowed us to go into areas that we formerly would not have considered at the $1 price point. So the store penetration population is something we look at -- well, let's put it this way. I was in Ontario this week and I teased my guys there saying that we're better penetrated in Québec that in Ontario so you should get off your tushes and move a bit. So in that sense, I'll use it. But really, every city and every country, you can talk all you want, but trying to get penetration in Downtown Vancouver is just almost impossible. And there's a lot of people that live there. So every province is different. Every country is different. And it's tough to use that penetration other than to get people moving as the guideline, I think, it goes store-by-store, opportunity-by-opportunity. You look at it, and then you make a call. That's the way we do it anyways.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nAnd as you've progressed on taking items above $1 up to a greater percentage of your business, has that also though allowed you to take on slightly higher rent expense and still make a good return?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI would think that, that is so.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes, definitely.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWell, Michael is saying yes. So there you go.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nMichael's obviously right.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nHe is obviously right.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nAnd last question. Just in the quarter, like obviously gross margin being up 25 basis points pre-rent was a very strong outcome. Was there any dynamic as a result of the prior year ice storm disruption that helped...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nFor sure. I think in December last year, we were down 11% or something like that. It was ridiculously low. And...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. For December, it was minus 7.5%.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nOkay, and this year?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nAnd this year, yes, the transaction, if I recall, it was down 3.1% in Q4 last year. So it clearly had an impact this year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes. And the same thing is happening in the Maritimes right now, by the way, but this is February, it's not Christmas, thankfully.\n\n---\n\n【質問: James Durran (Analysts)】\nYes. So then on gross margin rate though in the quarter, I assume that the negative impact on seasonal sales last year, which is a high margin category, would have potentially, this year, contributed to a gross margin recovery with less disruption.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nIt's more the scaling, I'd say, that is the impact. So yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nJust a question on the freight cost. I presume you're buying mostly FOB, the Orient. I'm wondering if you're saving significant amounts on freight at the moment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nAbsolutely not. Mike, please confirm that too.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes, yes, yes. Yes, not significantly saving.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nNo, we are not. No, there's not even -- never mind, you can remove the word \"significant.\"\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Rossy (Executives)】\nThey are also greatly impacted by the demand, not just the cost of oil. And the demand is very high right now and so you're competing for the same boats, and so the freight industry is happy.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nSo with the resurgence of the American economy, it more than offsets the gasoline price, unless you're a better negotiator of freight rates than we are.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nYes, I expect not. And then just on the use of your POS systems, does that help reduce the packaway? Like does it help you forecast seasonal demand or is seasonal demand so volatile or variable that it's hard to reduce packaway with the systems?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nWell, I guess it definitely gave us more information. Now instead of having 1 packaway for a season, we're able to split it in a more efficient way. But the other -- the savings I was alluding to before are in terms of when you change over seasons and you actually do the packaway, packing away will be quicker with the Wi-Fi application. And therefore, you have to have POS before, but now with the Wi-Fi to actually do the -- so you have time savings.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nSo let me add to that. POS is putting more of the right stock into the right stores. So hopefully, our packaway will be less and less as time goes on because the ideal is to buy 100 dozen to a store and to be sold out with the last customer on December 24. And as POS gets more sophisticated, that's the goal. And it's improving every year, but we're far from there. And I'm looking forward to the day that we can sell out of Christmas, have no packaway and satisfy every single customer until 5:00 on December 24. And I repeat that every season, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nAnd just one question on the general preferential tariff that I guess we've been dealing with now over a few months. Before you'd said there wasn't much impact on your business, and I'm just wondering if that's still the view.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. Well, it had an impact, but not material in the sense that we said we would be able to manage it, which clearly we've done, and we'll continue to do. So it's just part of the headwinds that we deal with, but we're equipped to manage it like we're equipped to manage the currency, the energy cost inflation, the merchandising inflation and so on.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nIt's not fun, but if you're -- we're talking about the duty rate increases here.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes, yes, yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nIf the duty goes up from 5% to 6.5%, well, you'll have that to deal with. But if the duty -- if there was no duty on, as an example...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Rossy (Executives)】\nPaint rollers.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nOn paint rollers, as Neil will testify, go ahead.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Rossy (Executives)】\nAnd it goes up to 15.5%, well, then it's much less fun, as my father put it. So we have to find alternatives, other countries and other suppliers. And it's part of the buyer's job to find a way.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Keith Howlett (Analysts)】\nAnd so is it much of a percentage of the goods that are creating those problems? Or is it...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Rossy (Executives)】\nThankfully, it's not at all material.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes. We name the 2 extremes. Well, 1 -- we name 1 extreme there.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Rossy (Executives)】\nYes, that's the most extreme.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes, so buy your paintbrushes now.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Rossy (Executives)】\nPaint rollers.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nPaint rollers now...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Neil Rossy (Executives)】\nNot paintbrushes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nBefore that goes through the system at -- from Dollarama to Rona or wherever.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Li (Analysts)】\nJust first question, the 1,400 store target you have, over what time frame is that -- do you expect that to be achieved?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nI think it's safe to assume, we said 70 to 80 stores for F '16. In the future, I'd be -- I tend to say 60 stores per year-ish. So that's a 7 to -- 6 to 7 or 8 years of runway in front of us.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Li (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then for the F '16 stores, are all the locations pretty much locked in or -- that now you're looking at locations?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nYes. They're pretty much locked in, yes.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Li (Analysts)】\nPerfect. Okay. And I mean, let's just say if Walmart would announce tomorrow that they're going take over 50 of the Target locations in Canada, is that a concern for you? Or would it be a positive as it would drive more traffic to the shopping centers where there's [indiscernible]?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI think it would be a positive. I don't know if they're going to take 50, but you may be giving us some insight there. But any location that Walmart takes will drive a lot more traffic than, well, Zellers or unfortunately, Target was drawing. So I think it's positive.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Li (Analysts)】\nAnd the assumption there is that the product mix obviously is different enough that there won't be a lot of overlap.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nThere's very little overlap.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nAnd Chris, as you know, we've got the experience of our current stores. So with -- which overlap with the 380 other Walmart stores in Canada. And again, these stores -- our stores perform very well.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Li (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then just in terms of your store traffic, it sounds like from the press release that you've excluded the impact of the ice storm. The traffic was roughly stable compared to the year-ago quarter. Is that right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nNo. It's -- well, this year, it was much more positive. Obviously, last year was negative 3.1%. This year was positive 3.6%. So the average of that is slightly positive.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Chris Li (Analysts)】\nAnd that's more or less in line with what you were expecting?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes, yes.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Morrison (Analysts)】\nI just want to go back to a couple of comments you made with respect to the penetration rate currently over 71% over $1 right now. You mentioned you have less opportunity items at $1. You've now had the $2.50 and $3 price points in for coming up on 3 years now. I'm wondering if you can just discuss your thoughts on potential to have an increase to the maximum price point of $3 right now. What goes into that and when you may need or consider implementing a higher price point?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWell, that's a good question I've been asking myself and we've been asking ourselves. I think it's going to depend a lot on the foreign exchange. There's only so much managing you can do. And it's happened very quickly. I'm getting calls from individuals who know me, what are we doing about that and how we're going to absorb that. And everybody in Canada has those concerns, and it's making retail in Canada a lot more difficult and a lot less fun. It's not fun to increase something. It's not fun to increase prices, period, especially how competitive everything is. And you don't know what your fellow retailer is doing or how he's handling it. So the speed at which this Canadian dollar has lost value is a concern to everybody, and we're going to have to look at it very quickly and soon. Just again, to take an item from $2 to $2.50 or $2.50 to $3 is not very, well, I'll use the word, fun. Now would that necessitate going above those price points? Not for now, we hope, but we have to fight very hard to -- we'd be able to say that going forward at a $1.30, $1.35 Canadian dollar, that we can maintain our price points without looking at them very carefully.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Morrison (Analysts)】\nSo how far in advance do you have to make that decision prior to...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWell, I would say that as an example, I would say, 6 months to 1 year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Morrison (Analysts)】\nOkay. And if you were to introduce a new price point, would you maintain the, say, 6 or 7 number of price points that you currently have offered and eliminate others? Or would you just add additional price points?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nWell, now you're getting ahead of all of us here. I can't answer that question because I don't know the answer to it. I would like to eliminate some and add some if that's what we have to do, but I don't know. I can't answer that question.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Brian Morrison (Analysts)】\nOkay. And then very last question. Is there any update on the progress of what's going on down at Dollar City in terms of expansion or number of new stores or anything you can provide us on that front?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nWell, there's, again, nothing material. No major change, but for us, it's going -- it's -- they're meeting expectations clearly, and so it's still very much alive.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Irene Nattel (Analysts)】\nMost of my questions have been answered, but just one more. Given all of the discussion we've been having on the call today, do you have any updated thoughts on credit cards and when you might move to accepting credit cards?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Michael Ross (Executives)】\nYes. No update, especially that the debit card continues to -- penetration continues to increase steadily and especially in the last quarter. So as long as that's very much alive, there's -- we'll continue with that and there's no intention to, at this point, to implement credit cards.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Laurence Rossy (Executives)】\nI agree with Michael 100%.",

      "transcript_text1": "Thank you, Labrielle, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Vasos, our Chief Operating Officer; and David Tehle, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks, and then we will open up the call for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under Investor Information, Press Releases.\r\nLet me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, predictions and other nonhistorical matters, such as our 2015 forecasted financial results and capital expenditures, our planned fiscal 2015 operating and merchandising initiatives, and our 2015 and 2016 store growth initiatives and our beliefs regarding future consumer economic trends. Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those reflected in or implied by our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning, our 2013 Form 10-K, which was filed on March 20, 2014, any subsequently filed Form 10-Qs and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call.\r\nWe will also reference certain financial measures not derived in accordance with GAAP. Where available, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this morning's earnings release, which I mentioned is posted on dollargeneral.com.\r\nThe purpose of our call today is to discuss our performance for the fiscal Q4 2014 quarter and fiscal year and our outlook for the 2015 fiscal year. At the end of our prepared remarks, we'll open the call up to your questions on those subjects. [Operator Instructions] Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Mary Winn, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Today, we reported results for the fourth quarter 2014 and the full year.\r\n2014 was a unique year for Dollar General as we generated record operating results, but our strategic actions to acquire Family Dollar were unsuccessful. However, as our results and outlook indicate, Dollar General has a very promising future. Today's accelerated store growth plans for 2016 and expanded capital return plan for shareholders reaffirm our continued confidence in our long-term growth prospects. Returning cash to shareholders remains a top priority, and we plan to return approximately $1.6 billion to shareholders during 2015 through both share repurchases and the initiation of a regular cash quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share.\r\nI'm excited about another great year in 2015 as we look to capitalize on the numerous opportunities ahead of us. We have been and remain focused on Dollar General's core business, and we are confident that Dollar General is well positioned for sustainable growth, creating shareholder value going forward.\r\nLet's recap some of the highlights for 2014. Full year sales increased 8% to a record $18.9 billion, and sales per square foot increased to $2 -- $223. \r\n2014 marked our 25th consecutive year of same-store sales growth as we delivered same-store sales growth of 2.8% for the year. Importantly, our trends improved as we moved through the year. Our same-store sales for the fourth quarter increased 4.9%, marking our fourth consecutive quarter of acceleration. In the quarter, same-store sales growth was balanced across both consumables and non-consumables. The non-consumables categories have had -- now had 4 consecutive quarters of improvement with notable strength in apparel and home.\r\nFor the year, GAAP earnings per share increased 10% and adjusted earnings per share increased 9%. Net income in the fourth quarter increased 10%. Earnings per share improved 16% to $1.17 per share.\r\nFor the quarter, the recent West Coast port slowdown negatively impacted our earnings per share by approximately $0.02 as higher margin merchandise coming through the West Coast port was delayed. This estimate includes incremental costs for shipments that had to be diverted to alternative facilities on the East Coast.\r\nFor the 28th consecutive quarter, we increased both our customer traffic and average ticket. We generated significant cash flow from operations of $1.3 billion, an increase of more than 8%. \r\nDuring the year, we returned $800 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 14.1 million shares of common stock.\r\nAs our results indicate, we continued to make great progress in 2014. We opened 700 new stores and exceeded our combined remodels and relocation targets with 915 stores, increasing our selling square footage by 6.3%. We broke ground on our 13th distribution center in San Antonio, Texas to help us serve our growing store base in the southwest and generate efficiencies.\r\nOn the merchandising front, we continued to innovate and improve the sales productivity of our stores. We successfully completed our first full year of tobacco sales and saw positive year-over-year performance after the anniversary. Our renewed focus on $1- to $5-items continued to gain traction with our customers. Now more than 75% of our SKUs or 76% of our sales in the fourth quarter were items priced at $5 or less. I'm pleased to say that we continued to increase our overall market share in consumables in both units and dollars across all markets over the 4-week, 12-week, 24-week and 52-week periods ending January 31, 2015. As we experienced last quarter, our emphasis on affordability continues to pay off as our unit share growth continues to outpace our dollar share growth over any period measured in the last 52 weeks.\r\nIn 2014, we successfully stabilized our shrink performance in the second quarter. Shrink had a modest positive contribution year-over-year to our gross margin performance in the second half of the year. This should bode well for 2015. \r\nWe relaunched our customer satisfaction survey at the beginning of 2014 to reevaluate those aspects of the store experience that have the greatest impact on satisfaction and customer spending. We have seen the response from our customers improve consistently over the last 6 months as we measure what is important to them. We are constantly striving to fill the need to meet the changing demands of our customers. Looking ahead to 2015, we are cautiously optimistic for our core customer. For the first time in a number of years, there appears to be the potential for tailwinds to outweigh the headwinds for macro trends. And the consumer is more positive, as indicated by the recent consumer sentiment levels and consumer confidence having recently been at the highest level since August of 2007. It is my belief that these consumer confidence readings are impacted by a headlines job number that has improved and by lower energy prices. Offset to these positives are the elevated underemployment rate along with the continuing low labor participation rate, and we are watching these factors closely.\r\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Todd to talk about our initiatives for 2015.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Rick. Moving on to 2015, our core operating priorities remain clear: driving productive sales growth, enhancing gross margins, leveraging process improvement in IT to reduce cost, and strengthening and expanding our culture of serving others. The team is focused, and we are excited about our initiatives for 2015. \r\nWe continue to be committed as ever to providing our customers with everyday low prices they know and trust at Dollar General. Affordability will play a key role as we look to expand SKUs across the store at the sweet spot of $1 to $5. Growing transactions and item units will continue to be key to our market share performance as we build upon our track record of success. \r\nIn anticipation of changes to the competitive landscape, we've been testing several different labor models to determine the potential impact on sales growth. The goal of the test was to strategically target labor investments to grow market share in a competitive environment while providing for positive financial returns. Our experience in this test and learn has been positive, and we are selectively investing in store labor this year. The store operations team has specific metrics and timetables for achieving results. The great part of this is that we can be nimble in making adjustments to the model as appropriate. While I won't go into more detail today, I look forward to sharing more specifics and results as we roll through the program in 2015. \r\nIn addition, we have realigned our store operations management structure to optimize the scale of our divisions, regions and districts to improve accountability and maximize mentorship and teamwork, all while driving stronger, more sustainable results. We made the alignment changes based on feedback we received from our field teams and a strategic evaluation of our operational structure and store growth plans. The result is an operational structure that allows our field leaders to focus on store standards and ultimately create a better and more consistent shopping experience for our consumers. For 2015, on average, we have reduced the number of stores per district. By optimizing the scale of our districts, we will reduce the time our district managers spend driving so they can invest more time mentoring and coaching our store managers on developing and strengthening their teams. This should result in improved store standards and drive incremental sales.\r\nOn the merchandising front, we're in the midst of repackaging our private brands across both select consumable and non-consumable categories. The goal of the repackaging is to enhance our customers' perception of our private brand quality and value for the price. We had a test launch of the new packaging in select products with very encouraging results, and the majority of these repackaged items are expected to be on the shelf by midyear. We continue to grow our private brands with SKU count up 6% over 2013 and penetration of about 24%.\r\nWe are continuously looking for ways to leverage technology and engage our customers. We completed the initial rollout of our digital coupon capabilities in August and began to aggressively launch the program at the end of September and throughout the fourth quarter with our Fast Way to Save promotion. To date, sign-ups have significantly exceeded our expectations with about 1 million customers having registered for the program. With more than 35 million digital coupons downloaded already, activations and redemptions are having a strong impact on sales of coupon-specific items.\r\nIn 2015, we'll be able to use the data captured from this program like a loyalty card but without the incremental cost. For instance, we plan to use these insights from a customer's shopping trip to customize individual promotions and ultimately drive incremental trips and larger baskets.\r\nShrink improvement has been and continues to be one of our largest gross margin opportunities as we remain committed to reducing our shrink levels on a store-by-store basis. At Dollar General, every function is involved in driving shrink improvement. The store format and layout, SKU rationalization of high-shrink items, defensive merchandising and exception-based reporting all play a role as we look for shrink improvement going forward.\r\nDriving productivity at the store level is as important as ever. Our overarching goal is to create time savings that we can reinvest to better manage our stores and serve our customers. In order to enhance our productivity gains, we are elevating the category management process to optimize all areas of the store beyond the planograms to include off-shelf and end-cap displays. Over the last several years, we have made significant strides in the productivity of our planograms through SKU selection and ongoing refinement. We feel we have established a strong foundation in our planograms that we can refine periodically. We are concentrating on simplifying work at the store level by reducing the complexity of planogram resets.\r\nAt Dollar General, real estate is a core strength. Our real estate model is disciplined and focused on financial returns. We're very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2015 as our pipeline is full and the real estate team is already working on the pipeline for accelerated growth in selling square feet of approximately 7% in 2016. This translates to approximately 900 new store openings for 2016. We have a strong track record of delivering exceptional returns in our new store program, and we are confident in our model going forward.  \r\nIn total, growth in selling square footage in 2015 is expected to be about 6%. Just to put this growth in perspective, this equates to about 7 projects a day for our real estate team across new stores, relocations and remodels. We plan to open approximately 730 new stores. We have already expanded our footprint into 3 new states in 2015: Maine, Rhode Island and Oregon, as we use our real estate model to identify winning sites for our traditional Dollar General format. Our new stores, productivity continues to be 85% of our comp base, and we're looking forward to successful new store openings in 2015.\r\nIn addition, about 875 stores will be relocated or remodeled in 2015. In 2014, we concentrated our remodel program on our legacy smaller-footprint stores. This approach allowed us to improve adjacencies and planogram layouts. These stores are getting close to the same sales lift as we get in our full remodels with a much lower investment, resulting in returns on life-cycle remodels that are over 200 basis points higher than our full remodels. As a result of the success of our life cycle remodels in 2014, we are applying these learnings to all remodels in 2015. During the first quarter of 2015, we are utilizing our merchandising predictive technology capabilities in select life cycle remodels to optimize our space and SKU productivity, so we can expect these remodels to drive even higher sales.\r\nAlso in 2015, we will open our 13th distribution center as we continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our growth. We plan on shipping from this distribution center in late fiscal 2015. \r\nWe are excited about our plans, and I'm confident that we'll meet our operating goals. We continue to be cautiously optimistic regarding the economic outlook for our customers. But we will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General. \r\nNow David will share a more detailed review of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and our 2015 guidance.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Rick and Todd have taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of the quarter and year as well as our outlook for fiscal 2015.\r\nGross margin for the fourth quarter was 31.7% of sales, a decrease of 23 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. As compared to the prior year, the 2 most significant factors were the negative impact from the West Coast port slowdown and the LIFO provision that was made in the fourth quarter. Specifically, the West Coast port disruption led to an estimated $8.5 million or $0.02 per share negative impact due to the higher-margin inventory receipt not being received and incremental transportation costs. In addition, we recorded a LIFO provision of about $1.1 million in the 2014 fourth quarter compared to a LIFO benefit of $4.5 million in the 2013 fourth quarter.\r\nTotal SG&A increased by 27 basis points in the fourth quarter as we were lapping last year's significant leverage in SG&A due to the reversal of incentive compensation in the fourth quarter of 2013. This alone contributed 34 basis points to the SG&A increase. In addition, we incurred $6.1 million in expense during the fourth quarter of 2014, or 12 basis points, related to the attempted acquisition of Family Dollar. We had good underlying expense performance that was favorable for both retail and admin functions.\r\nOur tax rate for the quarter was 34.8% compared to 37.5% in the 2013 quarter. This included a $9 million or $0.03-per-share benefit from the reenactment retroactive to January 1, 2014, of the federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit. This was in line with the outlook we provided on our third quarter call. The fourth quarter of 2014 also benefited from the deductibility of expenses incurred in prior quarters associated with our attempted acquisition of Family Dollar.\r\nTurning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents at year-end totaled nearly $580 million as we did not buy back shares in the second half of the year because of the attempted acquisition. At year-end, merchandise inventories were $2.78 billion, up 9% in total or 2.9% on a per-store basis. \r\nTotal capital expenditures were $374 million, including $127 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $102 million for new leased stores; $38 million for stores built by us; $64 million for distribution center and transportation-related items; and $35 million for information system upgrades and technology-related projects.\r\nNow for an overview of our guidance for 2015. We expect top line sales for 2015 to increase 8% to 9%. Overall square -- selling square footage is expected to grow approximately 6%, and same-store sales are expected to increase by 3% to 3.5%. Operating profit is forecasted to be in the range of 7% to 9% over adjusted operating profits for 2014.\r\nWe expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 37% to 38%. Similar to 2014, we expect the WOTC legislation to be reenacted by the end of 2015. This benefit is included in our tax rate. As a result, our effective tax rate will be higher early in the year and lower later in the year.\r\nWe expect diluted earnings per share of $3.85 to $3.95, representing growth of 10% to 13% over the 2014 adjusted EPS of $3.50. \r\nWe remain committed to maintaining a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, all while maintaining our investment-grade rating.  Demonstrating this commitment, we announced today we have initiated a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock. \r\nThe board also approved an additional $1 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization. We are assuming approximately 295 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year, which assumes the anticipated repurchase of approximately $1.3 billion of our common stock. All in, this repurchase activity represents approximately 6% of our current market capitalization. Also to put this in context, since December of 2011, we have repurchased $2.3 billion of our common stock. By the end of fiscal 2015, we are forecasting total share repurchases since inception to be about $3.6 billion, with 2015 repurchases representing about 36% of the total. In total, as Rick mentioned, we plan to return about $1.6 billion to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and dividends in 2015.\r\n2015 capital expenditures are forecasted to be in the range of $500 million to $550 million. Approximately 35% will be for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; 30% for new leased stores or stores built by us; 25% for distribution center and transportation-related items; and 10% for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects. \r\nAs we mentioned, we're closely monitoring the residual effects of the West Coast port slowdown and the impact on our seasonal merchandise receipts. The good news is that a tentative agreement has been reached, but it will take months to clear the backlog. Right now, based on the current status of shipments and the uncertainty surrounding the situation, we anticipate a possible drag to earnings of about $0.01 to $0.02 per diluted share in the first quarter. And we'll continue to monitor the impact to the timing of receipt and any potential sales and markdown risks as we work through the backlog.\r\nAs our long-term track record demonstrates, Dollar General is well positioned to serve our customers regardless of how the economy plays out. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Rick.\n\n---\n\nThanks, David. Before we wrap up, I would like to express my appreciation and gratitude to David upon his announced retirement. David has served for nearly 11 years as our CFO. He has been a trusted adviser, business partner and more importantly, a good friend to me. His financial acumen, partnership and steady hand at the helm of our financial strategy have been instrumental in transforming Dollar General and in fueling our impressive growth. While I will truly miss David's leadership and working with him on a daily basis, I'm incredibly happy for him. And I want to wish David, his wife, Mona, and his 2 sons, Nick and Tony, much happiness as they embark on this exciting new journey. \r\nDollar General is a strong and growing business with tremendous high store-return growth opportunities that we intend to capture. Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value are unchanged. Even as the competitive landscape continues to evolve, we have a business model that is proven and resilient. Our business generates significant cash flow and we're in a position to invest in store growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and dividends.\r\nMore importantly, I remain excited by the countless opportunities in front of Dollar General and convinced of its ability to capture them. My appreciation and thanks goes out to more than the 105,000 Dollar General employees that executed nearly 1.7 billion customer transactions in 2014 while fulfilling our mission of serving others. \r\nWith that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines up for questions.\n\n---\n\nOperator, we'll go for questions. Would you mind, repeat the instructions, if you would, please, for getting in the queue.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Mary Winn Pilkington (Executives)】\nThank you, Labrielle, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Vasos, our Chief Operating Officer; and David Tehle, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks, and then we will open up the call for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under Investor Information, Press Releases.\r\nLet me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, predictions and other nonhistorical matters, such as our 2015 forecasted financial results and capital expenditures, our planned fiscal 2015 operating and merchandising initiatives, and our 2015 and 2016 store growth initiatives and our beliefs regarding future consumer economic trends. Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those reflected in or implied by our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning, our 2013 Form 10-K, which was filed on March 20, 2014, any subsequently filed Form 10-Qs and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call.\r\nWe will also reference certain financial measures not derived in accordance with GAAP. Where available, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this morning's earnings release, which I mentioned is posted on dollargeneral.com.\r\nThe purpose of our call today is to discuss our performance for the fiscal Q4 2014 quarter and fiscal year and our outlook for the 2015 fiscal year. At the end of our prepared remarks, we'll open the call up to your questions on those subjects. [Operator Instructions] Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nThank you, Mary Winn, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Today, we reported results for the fourth quarter 2014 and the full year.\r\n2014 was a unique year for Dollar General as we generated record operating results, but our strategic actions to acquire Family Dollar were unsuccessful. However, as our results and outlook indicate, Dollar General has a very promising future. Today's accelerated store growth plans for 2016 and expanded capital return plan for shareholders reaffirm our continued confidence in our long-term growth prospects. Returning cash to shareholders remains a top priority, and we plan to return approximately $1.6 billion to shareholders during 2015 through both share repurchases and the initiation of a regular cash quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share.\r\nI'm excited about another great year in 2015 as we look to capitalize on the numerous opportunities ahead of us. We have been and remain focused on Dollar General's core business, and we are confident that Dollar General is well positioned for sustainable growth, creating shareholder value going forward.\r\nLet's recap some of the highlights for 2014. Full year sales increased 8% to a record $18.9 billion, and sales per square foot increased to $2 -- $223. \r\n2014 marked our 25th consecutive year of same-store sales growth as we delivered same-store sales growth of 2.8% for the year. Importantly, our trends improved as we moved through the year. Our same-store sales for the fourth quarter increased 4.9%, marking our fourth consecutive quarter of acceleration. In the quarter, same-store sales growth was balanced across both consumables and non-consumables. The non-consumables categories have had -- now had 4 consecutive quarters of improvement with notable strength in apparel and home.\r\nFor the year, GAAP earnings per share increased 10% and adjusted earnings per share increased 9%. Net income in the fourth quarter increased 10%. Earnings per share improved 16% to $1.17 per share.\r\nFor the quarter, the recent West Coast port slowdown negatively impacted our earnings per share by approximately $0.02 as higher margin merchandise coming through the West Coast port was delayed. This estimate includes incremental costs for shipments that had to be diverted to alternative facilities on the East Coast.\r\nFor the 28th consecutive quarter, we increased both our customer traffic and average ticket. We generated significant cash flow from operations of $1.3 billion, an increase of more than 8%. \r\nDuring the year, we returned $800 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 14.1 million shares of common stock.\r\nAs our results indicate, we continued to make great progress in 2014. We opened 700 new stores and exceeded our combined remodels and relocation targets with 915 stores, increasing our selling square footage by 6.3%. We broke ground on our 13th distribution center in San Antonio, Texas to help us serve our growing store base in the southwest and generate efficiencies.\r\nOn the merchandising front, we continued to innovate and improve the sales productivity of our stores. We successfully completed our first full year of tobacco sales and saw positive year-over-year performance after the anniversary. Our renewed focus on $1- to $5-items continued to gain traction with our customers. Now more than 75% of our SKUs or 76% of our sales in the fourth quarter were items priced at $5 or less. I'm pleased to say that we continued to increase our overall market share in consumables in both units and dollars across all markets over the 4-week, 12-week, 24-week and 52-week periods ending January 31, 2015. As we experienced last quarter, our emphasis on affordability continues to pay off as our unit share growth continues to outpace our dollar share growth over any period measured in the last 52 weeks.\r\nIn 2014, we successfully stabilized our shrink performance in the second quarter. Shrink had a modest positive contribution year-over-year to our gross margin performance in the second half of the year. This should bode well for 2015. \r\nWe relaunched our customer satisfaction survey at the beginning of 2014 to reevaluate those aspects of the store experience that have the greatest impact on satisfaction and customer spending. We have seen the response from our customers improve consistently over the last 6 months as we measure what is important to them. We are constantly striving to fill the need to meet the changing demands of our customers. Looking ahead to 2015, we are cautiously optimistic for our core customer. For the first time in a number of years, there appears to be the potential for tailwinds to outweigh the headwinds for macro trends. And the consumer is more positive, as indicated by the recent consumer sentiment levels and consumer confidence having recently been at the highest level since August of 2007. It is my belief that these consumer confidence readings are impacted by a headlines job number that has improved and by lower energy prices. Offset to these positives are the elevated underemployment rate along with the continuing low labor participation rate, and we are watching these factors closely.\r\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Todd to talk about our initiatives for 2015.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nThank you, Rick. Moving on to 2015, our core operating priorities remain clear: driving productive sales growth, enhancing gross margins, leveraging process improvement in IT to reduce cost, and strengthening and expanding our culture of serving others. The team is focused, and we are excited about our initiatives for 2015. \r\nWe continue to be committed as ever to providing our customers with everyday low prices they know and trust at Dollar General. Affordability will play a key role as we look to expand SKUs across the store at the sweet spot of $1 to $5. Growing transactions and item units will continue to be key to our market share performance as we build upon our track record of success. \r\nIn anticipation of changes to the competitive landscape, we've been testing several different labor models to determine the potential impact on sales growth. The goal of the test was to strategically target labor investments to grow market share in a competitive environment while providing for positive financial returns. Our experience in this test and learn has been positive, and we are selectively investing in store labor this year. The store operations team has specific metrics and timetables for achieving results. The great part of this is that we can be nimble in making adjustments to the model as appropriate. While I won't go into more detail today, I look forward to sharing more specifics and results as we roll through the program in 2015. \r\nIn addition, we have realigned our store operations management structure to optimize the scale of our divisions, regions and districts to improve accountability and maximize mentorship and teamwork, all while driving stronger, more sustainable results. We made the alignment changes based on feedback we received from our field teams and a strategic evaluation of our operational structure and store growth plans. The result is an operational structure that allows our field leaders to focus on store standards and ultimately create a better and more consistent shopping experience for our consumers. For 2015, on average, we have reduced the number of stores per district. By optimizing the scale of our districts, we will reduce the time our district managers spend driving so they can invest more time mentoring and coaching our store managers on developing and strengthening their teams. This should result in improved store standards and drive incremental sales.\r\nOn the merchandising front, we're in the midst of repackaging our private brands across both select consumable and non-consumable categories. The goal of the repackaging is to enhance our customers' perception of our private brand quality and value for the price. We had a test launch of the new packaging in select products with very encouraging results, and the majority of these repackaged items are expected to be on the shelf by midyear. We continue to grow our private brands with SKU count up 6% over 2013 and penetration of about 24%.\r\nWe are continuously looking for ways to leverage technology and engage our customers. We completed the initial rollout of our digital coupon capabilities in August and began to aggressively launch the program at the end of September and throughout the fourth quarter with our Fast Way to Save promotion. To date, sign-ups have significantly exceeded our expectations with about 1 million customers having registered for the program. With more than 35 million digital coupons downloaded already, activations and redemptions are having a strong impact on sales of coupon-specific items.\r\nIn 2015, we'll be able to use the data captured from this program like a loyalty card but without the incremental cost. For instance, we plan to use these insights from a customer's shopping trip to customize individual promotions and ultimately drive incremental trips and larger baskets.\r\nShrink improvement has been and continues to be one of our largest gross margin opportunities as we remain committed to reducing our shrink levels on a store-by-store basis. At Dollar General, every function is involved in driving shrink improvement. The store format and layout, SKU rationalization of high-shrink items, defensive merchandising and exception-based reporting all play a role as we look for shrink improvement going forward.\r\nDriving productivity at the store level is as important as ever. Our overarching goal is to create time savings that we can reinvest to better manage our stores and serve our customers. In order to enhance our productivity gains, we are elevating the category management process to optimize all areas of the store beyond the planograms to include off-shelf and end-cap displays. Over the last several years, we have made significant strides in the productivity of our planograms through SKU selection and ongoing refinement. We feel we have established a strong foundation in our planograms that we can refine periodically. We are concentrating on simplifying work at the store level by reducing the complexity of planogram resets.\r\nAt Dollar General, real estate is a core strength. Our real estate model is disciplined and focused on financial returns. We're very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2015 as our pipeline is full and the real estate team is already working on the pipeline for accelerated growth in selling square feet of approximately 7% in 2016. This translates to approximately 900 new store openings for 2016. We have a strong track record of delivering exceptional returns in our new store program, and we are confident in our model going forward.  \r\nIn total, growth in selling square footage in 2015 is expected to be about 6%. Just to put this growth in perspective, this equates to about 7 projects a day for our real estate team across new stores, relocations and remodels. We plan to open approximately 730 new stores. We have already expanded our footprint into 3 new states in 2015: Maine, Rhode Island and Oregon, as we use our real estate model to identify winning sites for our traditional Dollar General format. Our new stores, productivity continues to be 85% of our comp base, and we're looking forward to successful new store openings in 2015.\r\nIn addition, about 875 stores will be relocated or remodeled in 2015. In 2014, we concentrated our remodel program on our legacy smaller-footprint stores. This approach allowed us to improve adjacencies and planogram layouts. These stores are getting close to the same sales lift as we get in our full remodels with a much lower investment, resulting in returns on life-cycle remodels that are over 200 basis points higher than our full remodels. As a result of the success of our life cycle remodels in 2014, we are applying these learnings to all remodels in 2015. During the first quarter of 2015, we are utilizing our merchandising predictive technology capabilities in select life cycle remodels to optimize our space and SKU productivity, so we can expect these remodels to drive even higher sales.\r\nAlso in 2015, we will open our 13th distribution center as we continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our growth. We plan on shipping from this distribution center in late fiscal 2015. \r\nWe are excited about our plans, and I'm confident that we'll meet our operating goals. We continue to be cautiously optimistic regarding the economic outlook for our customers. But we will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General. \r\nNow David will share a more detailed review of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and our 2015 guidance.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: David Tehle (Executives)】\nThank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Rick and Todd have taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial details of the quarter and year as well as our outlook for fiscal 2015.\r\nGross margin for the fourth quarter was 31.7% of sales, a decrease of 23 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. As compared to the prior year, the 2 most significant factors were the negative impact from the West Coast port slowdown and the LIFO provision that was made in the fourth quarter. Specifically, the West Coast port disruption led to an estimated $8.5 million or $0.02 per share negative impact due to the higher-margin inventory receipt not being received and incremental transportation costs. In addition, we recorded a LIFO provision of about $1.1 million in the 2014 fourth quarter compared to a LIFO benefit of $4.5 million in the 2013 fourth quarter.\r\nTotal SG&A increased by 27 basis points in the fourth quarter as we were lapping last year's significant leverage in SG&A due to the reversal of incentive compensation in the fourth quarter of 2013. This alone contributed 34 basis points to the SG&A increase. In addition, we incurred $6.1 million in expense during the fourth quarter of 2014, or 12 basis points, related to the attempted acquisition of Family Dollar. We had good underlying expense performance that was favorable for both retail and admin functions.\r\nOur tax rate for the quarter was 34.8% compared to 37.5% in the 2013 quarter. This included a $9 million or $0.03-per-share benefit from the reenactment retroactive to January 1, 2014, of the federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit. This was in line with the outlook we provided on our third quarter call. The fourth quarter of 2014 also benefited from the deductibility of expenses incurred in prior quarters associated with our attempted acquisition of Family Dollar.\r\nTurning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents at year-end totaled nearly $580 million as we did not buy back shares in the second half of the year because of the attempted acquisition. At year-end, merchandise inventories were $2.78 billion, up 9% in total or 2.9% on a per-store basis. \r\nTotal capital expenditures were $374 million, including $127 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $102 million for new leased stores; $38 million for stores built by us; $64 million for distribution center and transportation-related items; and $35 million for information system upgrades and technology-related projects.\r\nNow for an overview of our guidance for 2015. We expect top line sales for 2015 to increase 8% to 9%. Overall square -- selling square footage is expected to grow approximately 6%, and same-store sales are expected to increase by 3% to 3.5%. Operating profit is forecasted to be in the range of 7% to 9% over adjusted operating profits for 2014.\r\nWe expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 37% to 38%. Similar to 2014, we expect the WOTC legislation to be reenacted by the end of 2015. This benefit is included in our tax rate. As a result, our effective tax rate will be higher early in the year and lower later in the year.\r\nWe expect diluted earnings per share of $3.85 to $3.95, representing growth of 10% to 13% over the 2014 adjusted EPS of $3.50. \r\nWe remain committed to maintaining a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, all while maintaining our investment-grade rating.  Demonstrating this commitment, we announced today we have initiated a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock. \r\nThe board also approved an additional $1 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization. We are assuming approximately 295 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year, which assumes the anticipated repurchase of approximately $1.3 billion of our common stock. All in, this repurchase activity represents approximately 6% of our current market capitalization. Also to put this in context, since December of 2011, we have repurchased $2.3 billion of our common stock. By the end of fiscal 2015, we are forecasting total share repurchases since inception to be about $3.6 billion, with 2015 repurchases representing about 36% of the total. In total, as Rick mentioned, we plan to return about $1.6 billion to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and dividends in 2015.\r\n2015 capital expenditures are forecasted to be in the range of $500 million to $550 million. Approximately 35% will be for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; 30% for new leased stores or stores built by us; 25% for distribution center and transportation-related items; and 10% for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects. \r\nAs we mentioned, we're closely monitoring the residual effects of the West Coast port slowdown and the impact on our seasonal merchandise receipts. The good news is that a tentative agreement has been reached, but it will take months to clear the backlog. Right now, based on the current status of shipments and the uncertainty surrounding the situation, we anticipate a possible drag to earnings of about $0.01 to $0.02 per diluted share in the first quarter. And we'll continue to monitor the impact to the timing of receipt and any potential sales and markdown risks as we work through the backlog.\r\nAs our long-term track record demonstrates, Dollar General is well positioned to serve our customers regardless of how the economy plays out. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Rick.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nThanks, David. Before we wrap up, I would like to express my appreciation and gratitude to David upon his announced retirement. David has served for nearly 11 years as our CFO. He has been a trusted adviser, business partner and more importantly, a good friend to me. His financial acumen, partnership and steady hand at the helm of our financial strategy have been instrumental in transforming Dollar General and in fueling our impressive growth.

Would you mind, repeat the instructions, if you would, please, for getting in the queue.",
      "transcript_text3": "Congrats, David, on your retirement. Just the first question on the 4.9% comp, could you share with us how it trended during the quarter? And any thoughts on quarter-to-date trends? And also just curious given your roughly 11% exposure to Texas, how the Texas market's holding in for you.\n\n---\n\nYes, the comps just accelerated through the quarter, every period, getting progressively better. The weather the last couple of weeks has been a little funky again, but I would say the first part of the current quarter is performing as expected. And Texas continues to be one of the strongest markets we have.\n\n---\n\nOkay, great. And then just bigger picture with the FDO deal now in the past, can you give us a sense for what you think the company's longer-term store potential could be? And then as -- and as a follow-up to that, where you think the DG Market concept fits into the equation?\n\n---\n\nYes, as we -- every -- like we do every year, Chuck, in January, we evaluate a number of opportunities that are out there. We still see over 13,000 store opportunities for Dollar stores in continental United States. As we committed, we're going to accelerate our store growth in 2016. We still believe store growth is the best use of our funds right now based on the returns we generate and how they comp after that first year. Dollar General Market is very much still, I would say, in the testing stage for us. As I've said before, I have grown up selling produce and meat, but teaching somebody to sell produce and meat are 2 entirely different things and we continue to work on that concept.\n\n---\n\nCongrats, David, on the retirement.\n\n---\n\nThank you.\n\n---\n\nStaying on that, Rick, David, you've been quite a duo here for some time. Can you just discuss the timing of your departures a bit more in detail? 2015 is becoming quite a big transitional year for Dollar General. Just why should we be extremely confident in DG's ability to continue to perform in what's an ever-changing competitive and consolidating marketplace? And also, why has the board not yet announced a successor for you, Rick? And what are the qualities that are being sought out?\n\n---\n\nYes. I think, Paul, that's very fair, and I'll let David weigh in here. Quite honestly, one of the things that we worked incredibly hard on in this company over the last few years has been the depth of our bench. And I think what should give all of you -- make you feel all really good is while David and I might be departing, there's a tremendous amount of strength behind us that manages this company on a day-in and day-out basis and actually, has been advising David and I for a very long period of time. If you think about -- there has been change over the last few years, and the bulk of that change has been satisfied by the bench that we have developed that we've been able to promote from within. In regards to myself, I can tell you the board is actively engaged in the search and the board is making solid progress. And I would anticipate that my successor, over the course of the next short period of time, will probably be identified. David, did you...\n\n---\n\nYes, I just -- obviously, retirement is a personal decision. I'm at the age where most people start to think seriously about it. This gives me a rare opportunity to spend lots of valuable time with my 2 teenage sons as they finish their last years of high school. And now I'll be able to make it to all of their events, which is something most fathers don't get to do. Over the past 11 years, particularly over the past 8 years, I've lived every CFO's dream. I was part of the team that took this company private in 2007, took it public in 2009 and had been able to participate in one of the most spectacular retail growth stories in this decade and it's continuing, as we announced today with our square footage growth for 2016 in opening 900 new stores, again, that's nothing short of spectacular. I believe I'm leaving one of the finest finance and accounting teams in retail today. So the company is in good hands in that respect, and I wouldn't be leaving if I didn't feel that way. So the experience has been great for me. I believe it will continue to be great for our shareholders and our employees as the Dollar General story keeps moving on.\n\n---\n\nI appreciate the color. Just to follow up on the remaining bigger picture, maybe just a bit more detail on how you came up with the capital return plan, some of the discussions you all had to decide to initiate the dividend and just how we should think about you guys managing the leverage ratio going forward? Is the plan to maintain this 3x kind of adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio on a go-forward basis? Are you willing to be more aggressive at times and go above that? Just how should we think about the balance of capital returns going forward?\n\n---\n\nDavid?\n\n---\n\nSure, I'll jump in here. And please, Rick or Todd, anything else you want to add here. I think probably the better question is why didn't do we a dividend earlier. 85% of companies in the S&P 500 pay a dividend, and until today, we were the largest retailer not paying one. So we clearly were an outlier on the dividend. As we looked at this decision, in this low interest rate environment, the dividend is highly valued by investors that are trying to find yield. And obviously, it's hard to find yield in the debt markets. I think this also sends a positive signal to the market of our confidence in future profitability and cash flow of the company. As we look at the share buyback, again -- and we went through some of these statistics. We've already returned $2.1 billion through the share repurchases since we went public in 2009, and we're guiding another $1.3 billion in 2015. That's 62% of what we bought back over the last 5 years, all being bought back in 1 year in 2015. So we are consistent in our share repurchases over time, and that investment-grade rating is important to us. We've talked about that in the prepared comments. We believe from our research is that's our optimal capital structure is to be at that lower rung of investment grade, and it provides us with flexibility for growth and ultimately, shareholder return. At the same time, and I've said this for many years, our #1 priority in terms of investing is investing in our stores, store growth, and then having the infrastructure in place to support that. And as I just mentioned, we're growing stores at a greater rate now than we have probably any time in the history of the company as we move forward into 2016, at least in the modern history of the company. So we'll continue to make that a priority. In terms of the leverage ratio, again, right now, because of our view that the optimal capital structure is going to be at that lowest rung of investment grade, our intent is to stay somewhere in that range. Clearly, the management team and the board will continually review this on an ongoing basis and so stay tuned on that. But right now, we're very happy with where we are and what we're doing.\n\n---\n\nSo 2 things just on the long term. How many stores can the organization handle annually? Right, if you think about that 7% number, obviously, it gets bigger as the base gets bigger, when do you get to a point where you worry about execution? And then you're basically assuming for this year, if I look at your guidance, roughly flat EBIT margin. Is that the right long-term algorithm? Or do you think there's room for margin improvement, maybe as shrink goes down and you leverage G&A and things like that?\n\n---\n\nTell you what, John, I'll let Todd handle the first part. And David, you can take the second part on that one.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Rick. John, and we've said it many times, we look at our store openings and the projects that we can do, we look at it from the respect of capacity and the capacity of our folks to be able to deliver the high-quality sites that we've been come to known to deliver over the many years. So we continue to reevaluate that. And as you've heard and you've seen, we've stepped it up to 730 this year and into 900 the following year. So we'll continue to look at ways to continue to do more projects as we move forward, but we're committed to square footage growth in that 6% to 7%.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think as we look at our operating margin, clearly, we do expect better performance than we saw in 2013 and 2014 given some of the product category headwinds we had from tobacco in those years. As we look forward, I think as we look at shrink and category management and foreign sourcing, again, we still think we have room to expand the operating margin. Now we've got to make a decision, and I've said this many times, in terms of how much of that to let fall to the bottom line and how much to invest back in our pricing because ultimately, our #1 goal remains selling units through the box and making sure that we continue to grow our transactions. So -- but again, there's still room there, particularly when you look at shrink, category management and foreign sourcing.\n\n---\n\nAnd then, Rick, just as a follow-up on DG Market. When you look at what Aldi's doing, Lidl coming, does that format hold greater importance to you strategically than it might have a couple of years ago? Can you -- before you leave, can you kind of get it on the right track? And then is it -- do you see more -- the impact will be more in -- and if you do go forward with it, more in the format itself or learnings that you take back into the core dollar stores, be it produce, expanded food? Or we're not really going to see that?\n\n---\n\nYes, I think as I look at what we do best and probably, I would say, John, right now, the best format we have, when you mention competitors like Aldi, is our 7,500-square-foot box. Yes, there's some -- Aldi has some more consumables in it. But you have to remember, we're a convenience shop. We're not a destination shop. And I think that 7,500 box, when you look at that producing $223 a foot, you look at where it has come from, we believe that is the best piece we've got. When I think about Dollar General Market, I think you hit the nail on the head. I think that learnings are what we're extracting from that. And the fact that some of those learnings eventually are going to work their way into that 7,500 highly productive box.\n\n---\n\nDavid, we'll be sorry to see you go, but congratulations on your retirement.\n\n---\n\nThank you.\n\n---\n\nMy question was related to expansion this coming year. And then as you step it up to 7% square footage growth next year, is there a particular regional focus that you'll have?\n\n---\n\nDan, that's a great question. The store base is going to expand pretty much uniformly all the way through United States. Obviously, we've just entered Oregon, Rhode Island and Maine. So there's probably a little bit more emphasis there, but the idea is to spread it out across the United States.\n\n---\n\nAnd you cited this focus on price investment. Just curious if you could comment on what you're seeing in the competitive landscape this past quarter and early this quarter?\n\n---\n\nGood. Todd, you want to take that one?\n\n---\n\nYes. Sure, Dan. What we've seen is in our channel and really across retail, it's always competitive. But what we've seen is a pretty rational competitive set, if you will. When you look at it, definitely much more rational than it was in fourth quarter of 2013. But there's pockets here and there we see, depending on the format that we see out there, that there are some competitors that may get a little hotter than others. But I -- we are committed to ensuring that we drive units and that we look at our share very, very intently each and every week to ensure that we're staying very competitive. But I think the biggest thing to take away is we are squarely EDLP focused, so everyday low price focused in everything we do.\n\n---\n\nLots of luck to you, David.\n\n---\n\nThanks, Meredith.\n\n---\n\nI got a couple of questions. And when David was talking about the things that would drive the operating margin, he didn't specifically mention higher sales of discretionary items. Even though I know that your apparel and home business is doing well, but do you see, as the customer feels better, that there is a potential to drive more high-margin sales?\n\n---\n\nAgain, I think the answer to that is yes. We've worked really, really hard on the non-consumables side, Meredith. And I have to be honest, it took us a little longer to get there than we wanted. But I'll tell you what, the team that Todd and David assembled down there are really clicking now. And that's really encouraging about the non-consumables side is the rate of sell-through. And we're seeing a much larger -- a much higher sell-through on those goods, which, to your point, brings out the incremental margin, helps us with the incremental margin.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then, I guess, my other question is maybe just a little more technical for David. But you continued to invest capital in stores that you're building yourselves, and I'm sure the economics of that are attractive. But I'm wondering whether there is an opportunity to do sale leasebacks, rates are low. And then if you were to do that, first, I don't know, maybe you could tell us how much -- how many stores you own at this point and whether you could generate incremental capital that could be invested or given back to shareholders?\n\n---\n\nYes. And of course, last year we did do sale-leaseback and we used those proceeds to buy back stock. So I don't -- it's something we'll definitely take a look at. It's always on -- we don't have any plans right now to do it. It's always on the radar screen and certainly, it's something that we'll take a hard look at. And then the -- how many owned stores we have? Yes, we have between 500 and 600 owned stores right now.\n\n---\n\nYes, about 5%.\n\n---\n\nCan you help break down the components of your 3% to 3.5% same-store sales guide? Particularly, I know you guys benefit on the real estate side from the new store waterfall. It sounds like you have a lot of traffic-driving initiatives, and then maybe just touch on the expectation for nonfood, given the recent acceleration.\n\n---\n\nI think Todd wants to take that one.\n\n---\n\nYes, when you take a look at it, what we -- we definitely, from our new store maturation, we see 1.5 to 2 percentage points of comp. Of course, category management plays a big piece in our comp as well. So between category management and execution at the store level, we really make up the balance piece of that. But affordability continues to be a key focus of ours to continue to drive the sales, as well as our focus on private brands. And then, lastly, you heard, we are doing a lot of remodels. We did a lot last year and we're -- we continue to do those in 2015. And updating that base out there of existing stores really makes a difference as we start to look at these remodels and adding to the comp. So when you put it all together, we feel pretty good about that 3% to 3.5% comp range.\n\n---\n\nAnd I would piggyback on that, Matt, and Todd did a great job of talking about it, but his work on the affordability issue, the fact that over 75% of our SKUs in sales now are targeted between $1 and $5, that has a lot of broad appeal across a lot of income stratas. And we are continuing to work on that very hard and see upside on that initiative in '15 and beyond, to be honest about it.\n\n---\n\nGreat. And then on the stores front, Rick, can you just elaborate on the return profile and the payback period on new stores? And any changes you guys have seen in productivity levels at some of your more recent openings?\n\n---\n\nYes, I will. Our stores still open up at about 85% of our average store volume. 99% of our stores continue to be four-wall EBITDA positive, and the payback is roughly 1 year, 1.5 years, in that window.\n\n---\n\nWell, we hate to see you young guys retire from the company.\n\n---\n\nActually, I was hoping for someone to say I'd been carrying David for 11 years.\n\n---\n\nI just wanted to ask on the stepped-up expansion rate in 2016, if you could talk about the type of real estate projects, particularly in terms of geography that you'll be pursuing that you would have perhaps passed on a year ago. And thinking specifically when you think about suburban, urban and rural markets, if we're going to see it change in the pace that you opened in those 3 type of geographies.\n\n---\n\nYes, I think Todd has a thought on that, Dan.\n\n---\n\nYes, Dan. As Rick said earlier, it is going to be broad-based across everywhere we are actually already operating stores in. We continue to look at all areas that we operate in. California continues to be an opportunity for us. We know that someday there will be over 1,100, 1,200 stores in California. So that continues to be an opportunity. But when you look at it in 2016, our balance between metro and rural is going to be about where it's been over the course of the last few years. And then as we go into outer years, we'll continue to leverage our learnings that we've got moving through on our metro stores and build and open up more of those as we move into '17, '18 and '19.\n\n---\n\nIf I could piggyback back then on, Dan, as we move further and further deeper into the 13,000, we're going to introduce more metro stores. And the team is looking at lots of different alternatives here in terms of the size of the box. We've actually been -- I think we've really done a great job on the mix that's in the stores. I do think that we have figured something out that we're going to test in '15 that could really guide us, really help generate incremental return in metro.\n\n---\n\nWhen you say metro stories, I'm assuming you're including suburban with urban. I was curious how would you just characterize Dollar General's success in suburban markets, which might have higher income levels than the company has targeted historically?\n\n---\n\nYes, I -- go ahead, Todd.\n\n---\n\nI'm sorry, did you...\n\n---\n\nNo. You go ahead, Todd.\n\n---\n\nYes, so when you look at it, our suburban stores, we're happy with the performance of those stores as -- but as Rick indicated, we're testing some things, both in suburban and metro, that we really feel can benefit us as we move through '15 and beyond, both from a labor perspective and a merchandising perspective with our technology that we've got moving in merch, to ensure we have the right mix of products as well as the right gross margin that is generated from that. So we feel pretty good about where we are, but there's always more learnings yet.\n\n---\n\nI think it's fair to say that we're getting sophisticated enough now that we're able to alter the mix.\n\n---\n\nThat's right.\n\n---\n\nAnd David, everyone's saying congratulations. I've got to say maybe I'm just a little envious. I have teenage kids at home. So congrats, I guess. It'll be nice to spend a lot more time with them.\n\n---\n\nWell, thank you.\n\n---\n\nI don't know, Scott. I raised 2 kids. I don't know if being home when they're teenagers is a good thing or not.\n\n---\n\nSo I guess, I want to get to labor cost, what you're thinking of as we look through the year. Obviously, a competitor raised their labor rates, but with labor markets getting pretty tight and how that affects your business, what you're seeing in store management turnover?\n\n---\n\nYes, I'll take that one. And then, Todd, if you want to lay any color on it, that would be fine. I know we're talking a lot about the minimum wage thing and what has happened with one of the larger big-box operators out there. A couple of things I'd like to lay out, Scott. Number one is we don't have a single full-time employee that's making minimum wage, not one. About 12% of our employees, all part time, are at the minimum wage rate. But the fascinating thing is the way our structure is in the store, after about 5 months, they are in a position to be promoted to what we call is a key carrier. And our average key carrier makes $9 an hour, approximately $9 an hour. So it's pretty safe to say that we -- our whole workforce is not making minimum wage and there is some sort of grand or fearful expense that's going to be there. And when I'm talking about minimum wage, I'm obviously talking about the federal minimum wage. What we are going to do though, I think it's fair to say the labor market, conceivably, is tightening up. We're going to keep our eyes. We're going to continue to monitor the landscape and we'll assess or make any adjustments that we need to make. But right now, in terms of what we're paying our people, we feel pretty comfortable that we're there. Our store manager turnover, quite frankly, is operating where it had been for a period of time. We are looking at it in terms of -- we look at it, excuse me, in terms of voluntary turnover and involuntary turnover. And obviously, there's a big difference between the 2. And when you add those 2 up, our turnover is around approximately 30%, which is a little high, quite frankly, for retail. I'd like to see that number down in the mid- to low 20s. But also I would tell you that our turnover has been improving over the course of the last 6 to 7 months, and it's continuing to move in a solid direction. So...\n\n---\n\nAll right. That's perfect. And if I can just follow up one and maybe -- I know there's transition going on with the leadership and everything, so maybe it's just -- it's too strategic but, obviously, you went for Family Dollar. It didn't work out. When you think about acquisitions or when you think about capital deployment, is acquisitions part of what you consider? Or is it really not -- just kind of one unique situation and not something we look at?\n\n---\n\nVery fair question. And I will tell you, Scott, David and I have always looked at everything. So the answer is nothing is ever off the table. We want to look, we want to understand what we could do to maximize value for our shareholders. And if that opportunity raises itself down the road, I'm sure the management team is going to want to look at it.\n\n---\n\nDavid, I'll add my congrats as well. I've actually got one question on the quarter, which is I'd love a little bit of color on the seasonal business. It looks like sales per foot were down about 1%. The 2-year stack was down about 6%. Is some of that related to the port? Or are there some other issues there?\n\n---\n\nTodd, go ahead.\n\n---\n\nYes, Matt, this is Todd. So when you look at our seasonal business, first, I want to say it's very healthy. Now when you back down and take a look at the components, the majority of the components are doing very well. The one structural piece that we, as well as probably other retailers, are fighting and battling every day is the toy business. The toy business is embedded in our seasonal business. And structurally, as we all know, that business had been very, very tough over the past few years with electronics and computers and video games and everything else being where -- much more prominent to kids these days than the toys. But we're very happy when we look at seasonal. The team has done a tremendous amount of work on affordability within seasonal. We have about 26%, last year, more $1 items that we had the year before. I can tell you they were squarely focused on the buy this year, which is now complete for holiday of 2015, and that number has been stepped up even more. But our sweet spot, as we said before, is really $1 to $5. But in seasonal, $1 to $3 is really where we play and we do very well in.\n\n---\n\nGreat. That's helpful. And then, secondly, I was looking to see if we can get some more color on the labor model that Todd mentioned, the new labor model. Is the primary goal to speed up checkout? Or is it more about maintaining the store? Love to get some more color on that and also whether that would be baked in the guidance if you decide to roll it out more broadly this year.\n\n---\n\nYes, Matt, thanks for letting me answer that one. I could tell you that the labor model that we have currently existing in our stores, we look at it each and every day to make sure that, that, in fact, is the right model. Now what we've seen is that in certain geographic areas, we can spend a little bit more time inside of our stores stocking and ensuring the customer experience is at the highest level that it possibly can. So what we've done is strategically taken a group of stores on a test and tested that theory. It tested out very well. And we are in the process, as we roll through 2015, to roll that test broadly out to a large group of our stores over 2015. Once again, it's very targeted to certain stores, but it is a large group of our stores.\n\n---\n\nSo during the conference call, I think it was you, Rick, that mentioned you do anticipate changes in the competitive landscape and obviously, Todd just talked about some of the changes on the labor model. Can you provide some color regarding what kind of changes you're expecting? And is this just on the pending -- any pending changes with Family Dollar, now that's going to be in new hands, or are there other elements that you were referencing?\n\n---\n\nYes, a fair question, Scot. I think that obviously the #1 thing on our radar screen is the change that is taking place between Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. Once again, the big-box guys are now announcing more initiatives. And what we're trying to do is just stay focused on absolutely everything that's out there. Now while we can only control what we can control, we have -- the beauty of our model is it takes a little bit from a lot of different spots rather than having to grab everything from one spot. So consequently, we stay focused on what absolutely everybody is doing. And yes, I didn't mean to send any unjust or unneeded fear or anything, but we're staying very focused on what everybody is doing. There's a lot of moving parts out there right now.\n\n---\n\nSo just a general expectation that it's going to be a dynamic competitive environment?\n\n---\n\nYes, just the fact that there's a lot of new faces managing new assets, right?\n\n---\n\nYes. Okay. Fair enough. And then my follow-up is any -- I guess, David, you talked a little about the EBIT margin opportunity down the road. Can you provide a little bit more color why you're expecting EBIT margins then to be flat to down this year, what -- versus what, frankly, seems to be a bit of an easy comparison following 4 straight years of kind of 10%-plus EBIT margins? Is it some of that's labor investment? Or is it just the continued mix shift on -- impact on the gross margin, et cetera?\n\n---\n\nYes, the biggest piece is clearly the labor investment that we're making in our SG&A line, and that really is the bulk of the story there. Again, we expect better performance than we saw in 2013 and 2014 on the gross margin, given some of the product category headwinds we had from tobacco in those years, cycling over that. And then I mentioned we continue to like what we're seeing in shrink, getting some improvement there, and then category management and foreign sourcing helping us. But it's the investment in labor that we're making.\n\n---\n\nAll right. I think that will conclude our call today. We have a new member of our IR team in Matt Hancock, and some -- I know some of you had a chance to meet Matt. If you haven't had a chance to meet him, I look forward to introducing to -- you to him. And we'll be around today for calls, so I know we will left some people in the queue, so please feel free to give me a call. Thank you. Operator, that will now conclude our call.",
      "transcript_text4": "【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nCongrats, David, on your retirement. Just the first question on the 4.9% comp, could you share with us how it trended during the quarter? And any thoughts on quarter-to-date trends? And also just curious given your roughly 11% exposure to Texas, how the Texas market's holding in for you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, the comps just accelerated through the quarter, every period, getting progressively better. The weather the last couple of weeks has been a little funky again, but I would say the first part of the current quarter is performing as expected. And Texas continues to be one of the strongest markets we have.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Charles Grom (Analysts)】\nOkay, great. And then just bigger picture with the FDO deal now in the past, can you give us a sense for what you think the company's longer-term store potential could be? And then as -- and as a follow-up to that, where you think the DG Market concept fits into the equation?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, as we -- every -- like we do every year, Chuck, in January, we evaluate a number of opportunities that are out there. We still see over 13,000 store opportunities for Dollar stores in continental United States. As we committed, we're going to accelerate our store growth in 2016. We still believe store growth is the best use of our funds right now based on the returns we generate and how they comp after that first year. Dollar General Market is very much still, I would say, in the testing stage for us. As I've said before, I have grown up selling produce and meat, but teaching somebody to sell produce and meat are 2 entirely different things and we continue to work on that concept.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nCongrats, David, on the retirement.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nThank you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nStaying on that, Rick, David, you've been quite a duo here for some time. Can you just discuss the timing of your departures a bit more in detail? 2015 is becoming quite a big transitional year for Dollar General. Just why should we be extremely confident in DG's ability to continue to perform in what's an ever-changing competitive and consolidating marketplace? And also, why has the board not yet announced a successor for you, Rick? And what are the qualities that are being sought out?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes. I think, Paul, that's very fair, and I'll let David weigh in here. Quite honestly, one of the things that we worked incredibly hard on in this company over the last few years has been the depth of our bench. And I think what should give all of you -- make you feel all really good is while David and I might be departing, there's a tremendous amount of strength behind us that manages this company on a day-in and day-out basis and actually, has been advising David and I for a very long period of time. If you think about -- there has been change over the last few years, and the bulk of that change has been satisfied by the bench that we have developed that we've been able to promote from within. In regards to myself, I can tell you the board is actively engaged in the search and the board is making solid progress. And I would anticipate that my successor, over the course of the next short period of time, will probably be identified. David, did you...\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nYes, I just -- obviously, retirement is a personal decision. I'm at the age where most people start to think seriously about it. This gives me a rare opportunity to spend lots of valuable time with my 2 teenage sons as they finish their last years of high school. And now I'll be able to make it to all of their events, which is something most fathers don't get to do. Over the past 11 years, particularly over the past 8 years, I've lived every CFO's dream. I was part of the team that took this company private in 2007, took it public in 2009 and had been able to participate in one of the most spectacular retail growth stories in this decade and it's continuing, as we announced today with our square footage growth for 2016 in opening 900 new stores, again, that's nothing short of spectacular. I believe I'm leaving one of the finest finance and accounting teams in retail today. So the company is in good hands in that respect, and I wouldn't be leaving if I didn't feel that way. So the experience has been great for me. I believe it will continue to be great for our shareholders and our employees as the Dollar General story keeps moving on.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Trussell (Analysts)】\nI appreciate the color. Just to follow up on the remaining bigger picture, maybe just a bit more detail on how you came up with the capital return plan, some of the discussions you all had to decide to initiate the dividend and just how we should think about you guys managing the leverage ratio going forward? Is the plan to maintain this 3x kind of adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio on a go-forward basis? Are you willing to be more aggressive at times and go above that? Just how should we think about the balance of capital returns going forward?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nDavid?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nSure, I'll jump in here. And please, Rick or Todd, anything else you want to add here. I think probably the better question is why didn't do we a dividend earlier. 85% of companies in the S&P 500 pay a dividend, and until today, we were the largest retailer not paying one. So we clearly were an outlier on the dividend. As we looked at this decision, in this low interest rate environment, the dividend is highly valued by investors that are trying to find yield. And obviously, it's hard to find yield in the debt markets. I think this also sends a positive signal to the market of our confidence in future profitability and cash flow of the company. As we look at the share buyback, again -- and we went through some of these statistics. We've already returned $2.1 billion through the share repurchases since we went public in 2009, and we're guiding another $1.3 billion in 2015. That's 62% of what we bought back over the last 5 years, all being bought back in 1 year in 2015. So we are consistent in our share repurchases over time, and that investment-grade rating is important to us. We've talked about that in the prepared comments. We believe from our research is that's our optimal capital structure is to be at that lower rung of investment grade, and it provides us with flexibility for growth and ultimately, shareholder return. At the same time, and I've said this for many years, our #1 priority in terms of investing is investing in our stores, store growth, and then having the infrastructure in place to support that. And as I just mentioned, we're growing stores at a greater rate now than we have probably any time in the history of the company as we move forward into 2016, at least in the modern history of the company. So we'll continue to make that a priority. In terms of the leverage ratio, again, right now, because of our view that the optimal capital structure is going to be at that lowest rung of investment grade, our intent is to stay somewhere in that range. Clearly, the management team and the board will continually review this on an ongoing basis and so stay tuned on that. But right now, we're very happy with where we are and what we're doing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nSo 2 things just on the long term. How many stores can the organization handle annually? Right, if you think about that 7% number, obviously, it gets bigger as the base gets bigger, when do you get to a point where you worry about execution? And then you're basically assuming for this year, if I look at your guidance, roughly flat EBIT margin. Is that the right long-term algorithm? Or do you think there's room for margin improvement, maybe as shrink goes down and you leverage G&A and things like that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nTell you what, John, I'll let Todd handle the first part. And David, you can take the second part on that one.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nThanks, Rick. John, and we've said it many times, we look at our store openings and the projects that we can do, we look at it from the respect of capacity and the capacity of our folks to be able to deliver the high-quality sites that we've been come to known to deliver over the many years. So we continue to reevaluate that. And as you've heard and you've seen, we've stepped it up to 730 this year and into 900 the following year. So we'll continue to look at ways to continue to do more projects as we move forward, but we're committed to square footage growth in that 6% to 7%.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nYes, I think as we look at our operating margin, clearly, we do expect better performance than we saw in 2013 and 2014 given some of the product category headwinds we had from tobacco in those years. As we look forward, I think as we look at shrink and category management and foreign sourcing, again, we still think we have room to expand the operating margin. Now we've got to make a decision, and I've said this many times, in terms of how much of that to let fall to the bottom line and how much to invest back in our pricing because ultimately, our #1 goal remains selling units through the box and making sure that we continue to grow our transactions. So -- but again, there's still room there, particularly when you look at shrink, category management and foreign sourcing.\n\n---\n\n【質問: John Heinbockel (Analysts)】\nAnd then, Rick, just as a follow-up on DG Market. When you look at what Aldi's doing, Lidl coming, does that format hold greater importance to you strategically than it might have a couple of years ago? Can you -- before you leave, can you kind of get it on the right track? And then is it -- do you see more -- the impact will be more in -- and if you do go forward with it, more in the format itself or learnings that you take back into the core dollar stores, be it produce, expanded food? Or we're not really going to see that?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, I think as I look at what we do best and probably, I would say, John, right now, the best format we have, when you mention competitors like Aldi, is our 7,500-square-foot box. Yes, there's some -- Aldi has some more consumables in it. But you have to remember, we're a convenience shop. We're not a destination shop. And I think that 7,500 box, when you look at that producing $223 a foot, you look at where it has come from, we believe that is the best piece we've got. When I think about Dollar General Market, I think you hit the nail on the head. I think that learnings are what we're extracting from that. And the fact that some of those learnings eventually are going to work their way into that 7,500 highly productive box.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nDavid, we'll be sorry to see you go, but congratulations on your retirement.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nThank you.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nMy question was related to expansion this coming year. And then as you step it up to 7% square footage growth next year, is there a particular regional focus that you'll have?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nDan, that's a great question. The store base is going to expand pretty much uniformly all the way through United States. Obviously, we've just entered Oregon, Rhode Island and Maine. So there's probably a little bit more emphasis there, but the idea is to spread it out across the United States.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Binder (Analysts)】\nAnd you cited this focus on price investment. Just curious if you could comment on what you're seeing in the competitive landscape this past quarter and early this quarter?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nGood. Todd, you want to take that one?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes. Sure, Dan. What we've seen is in our channel and really across retail, it's always competitive. But what we've seen is a pretty rational competitive set, if you will. When you look at it, definitely much more rational than it was in fourth quarter of 2013. But there's pockets here and there we see, depending on the format that we see out there, that there are some competitors that may get a little hotter than others. But I -- we are committed to ensuring that we drive units and that we look at our share very, very intently each and every week to ensure that we're staying very competitive. But I think the biggest thing to take away is we are squarely EDLP focused, so everyday low price focused in everything we do.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nLots of luck to you, David.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nThanks, Meredith.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nI got a couple of questions. And when David was talking about the things that would drive the operating margin, he didn't specifically mention higher sales of discretionary items. Even though I know that your apparel and home business is doing well, but do you see, as the customer feels better, that there is a potential to drive more high-margin sales?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nAgain, I think the answer to that is yes. We've worked really, really hard on the non-consumables side, Meredith. And I have to be honest, it took us a little longer to get there than we wanted. But I'll tell you what, the team that Todd and David assembled down there are really clicking now. And that's really encouraging about the non-consumables side is the rate of sell-through. And we're seeing a much larger -- a much higher sell-through on those goods, which, to your point, brings out the incremental margin, helps us with the incremental margin.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Meredith Adler (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then, I guess, my other question is maybe just a little more technical for David. But you continued to invest capital in stores that you're building yourselves, and I'm sure the economics of that are attractive. But I'm wondering whether there is an opportunity to do sale leasebacks, rates are low. And then if you were to do that, first, I don't know, maybe you could tell us how much -- how many stores you own at this point and whether you could generate incremental capital that could be invested or given back to shareholders?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nYes. And of course, last year we did do sale-leaseback and we used those proceeds to buy back stock. So I don't -- it's something we'll definitely take a look at. It's always on -- we don't have any plans right now to do it. It's always on the radar screen and certainly, it's something that we'll take a hard look at. And then the -- how many owned stores we have? Yes, we have between 500 and 600 owned stores right now.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mary Winn Pilkington (Executives)】\nYes, about 5%.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Boss (Analysts)】\nCan you help break down the components of your 3% to 3.5% same-store sales guide? Particularly, I know you guys benefit on the real estate side from the new store waterfall. It sounds like you have a lot of traffic-driving initiatives, and then maybe just touch on the expectation for nonfood, given the recent acceleration.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nI think Todd wants to take that one.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes, when you take a look at it, what we -- we definitely, from our new store maturation, we see 1.5 to 2 percentage points of comp. Of course, category management plays a big piece in our comp as well. So between category management and execution at the store level, we really make up the balance piece of that. But affordability continues to be a key focus of ours to continue to drive the sales, as well as our focus on private brands. And then, lastly, you heard, we are doing a lot of remodels. We did a lot last year and we're -- we continue to do those in 2015. And updating that base out there of existing stores really makes a difference as we start to look at these remodels and adding to the comp. So when you put it all together, we feel pretty good about that 3% to 3.5% comp range.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nAnd I would piggyback on that, Matt, and Todd did a great job of talking about it, but his work on the affordability issue, the fact that over 75% of our SKUs in sales now are targeted between $1 and $5, that has a lot of broad appeal across a lot of income stratas. And we are continuing to work on that very hard and see upside on that initiative in '15 and beyond, to be honest about it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matthew Boss (Analysts)】\nGreat. And then on the stores front, Rick, can you just elaborate on the return profile and the payback period on new stores? And any changes you guys have seen in productivity levels at some of your more recent openings?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, I will. Our stores still open up at about 85% of our average store volume. 99% of our stores continue to be four-wall EBITDA positive, and the payback is roughly 1 year, 1.5 years, in that window.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nWell, we hate to see you young guys retire from the company.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nActually, I was hoping for someone to say I'd been carrying David for 11 years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nI just wanted to ask on the stepped-up expansion rate in 2016, if you could talk about the type of real estate projects, particularly in terms of geography that you'll be pursuing that you would have perhaps passed on a year ago. And thinking specifically when you think about suburban, urban and rural markets, if we're going to see it change in the pace that you opened in those 3 type of geographies.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, I think Todd has a thought on that, Dan.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes, Dan. As Rick said earlier, it is going to be broad-based across everywhere we are actually already operating stores in. We continue to look at all areas that we operate in. California continues to be an opportunity for us. We know that someday there will be over 1,100, 1,200 stores in California. So that continues to be an opportunity. But when you look at it in 2016, our balance between metro and rural is going to be about where it's been over the course of the last few years. And then as we go into outer years, we'll continue to leverage our learnings that we've got moving through on our metro stores and build and open up more of those as we move into '17, '18 and '19.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nIf I could piggyback back then on, Dan, as we move further and further deeper into the 13,000, we're going to introduce more metro stores. And the team is looking at lots of different alternatives here in terms of the size of the box. We've actually been -- I think we've really done a great job on the mix that's in the stores. I do think that we have figured something out that we're going to test in '15 that could really guide us, really help generate incremental return in metro.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Daniel Wewer (Analysts)】\nWhen you say metro stories, I'm assuming you're including suburban with urban. I was curious how would you just characterize Dollar General's success in suburban markets, which might have higher income levels than the company has targeted historically?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, I -- go ahead, Todd.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nI'm sorry, did you...\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nNo. You go ahead, Todd.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes, so when you look at it, our suburban stores, we're happy with the performance of those stores as -- but as Rick indicated, we're testing some things, both in suburban and metro, that we really feel can benefit us as we move through '15 and beyond, both from a labor perspective and a merchandising perspective with our technology that we've got moving in merch, to ensure we have the right mix of products as well as the right gross margin that is generated from that. So we feel pretty good about where we are, but there's always more learnings yet.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nI think it's fair to say that we're getting sophisticated enough now that we're able to alter the mix.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nThat's right.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nAnd David, everyone's saying congratulations. I've got to say maybe I'm just a little envious. I have teenage kids at home. So congrats, I guess. It'll be nice to spend a lot more time with them.\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nWell, thank you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nI don't know, Scott. I raised 2 kids. I don't know if being home when they're teenagers is a good thing or not.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nSo I guess, I want to get to labor cost, what you're thinking of as we look through the year. Obviously, a competitor raised their labor rates, but with labor markets getting pretty tight and how that affects your business, what you're seeing in store management turnover?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, I'll take that one. And then, Todd, if you want to lay any color on it, that would be fine. I know we're talking a lot about the minimum wage thing and what has happened with one of the larger big-box operators out there. A couple of things I'd like to lay out, Scott. Number one is we don't have a single full-time employee that's making minimum wage, not one. About 12% of our employees, all part time, are at the minimum wage rate. But the fascinating thing is the way our structure is in the store, after about 5 months, they are in a position to be promoted to what we call is a key carrier. And our average key carrier makes $9 an hour, approximately $9 an hour. So it's pretty safe to say that we -- our whole workforce is not making minimum wage and there is some sort of grand or fearful expense that's going to be there. And when I'm talking about minimum wage, I'm obviously talking about the federal minimum wage. What we are going to do though, I think it's fair to say the labor market, conceivably, is tightening up. We're going to keep our eyes. We're going to continue to monitor the landscape and we'll assess or make any adjustments that we need to make. But right now, in terms of what we're paying our people, we feel pretty comfortable that we're there. Our store manager turnover, quite frankly, is operating where it had been for a period of time. We are looking at it in terms of -- we look at it, excuse me, in terms of voluntary turnover and involuntary turnover. And obviously, there's a big difference between the 2. And when you add those 2 up, our turnover is around approximately 30%, which is a little high, quite frankly, for retail. I'd like to see that number down in the mid- to low 20s. But also I would tell you that our turnover has been improving over the course of the last 6 to 7 months, and it's continuing to move in a solid direction. So...\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scott Mushkin (Analysts)】\nAll right. That's perfect. And if I can just follow up one and maybe -- I know there's transition going on with the leadership and everything, so maybe it's just -- it's too strategic but, obviously, you went for Family Dollar. It didn't work out. When you think about acquisitions or when you think about capital deployment, is acquisitions part of what you consider? Or is it really not -- just kind of one unique situation and not something we look at?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nVery fair question. And I will tell you, Scott, David and I have always looked at everything. So the answer is nothing is ever off the table. We want to look, we want to understand what we could do to maximize value for our shareholders. And if that opportunity raises itself down the road, I'm sure the management team is going to want to look at it.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matt Nemer (Analysts)】\nDavid, I'll add my congrats as well. I've actually got one question on the quarter, which is I'd love a little bit of color on the seasonal business. It looks like sales per foot were down about 1%. The 2-year stack was down about 6%. Is some of that related to the port? Or are there some other issues there?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nTodd, go ahead.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes, Matt, this is Todd. So when you look at our seasonal business, first, I want to say it's very healthy. Now when you back down and take a look at the components, the majority of the components are doing very well. The one structural piece that we, as well as probably other retailers, are fighting and battling every day is the toy business. The toy business is embedded in our seasonal business. And structurally, as we all know, that business had been very, very tough over the past few years with electronics and computers and video games and everything else being where -- much more prominent to kids these days than the toys. But we're very happy when we look at seasonal. The team has done a tremendous amount of work on affordability within seasonal. We have about 26%, last year, more $1 items that we had the year before. I can tell you they were squarely focused on the buy this year, which is now complete for holiday of 2015, and that number has been stepped up even more. But our sweet spot, as we said before, is really $1 to $5. But in seasonal, $1 to $3 is really where we play and we do very well in.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Matt Nemer (Analysts)】\nGreat. That's helpful. And then, secondly, I was looking to see if we can get some more color on the labor model that Todd mentioned, the new labor model. Is the primary goal to speed up checkout? Or is it more about maintaining the store? Love to get some more color on that and also whether that would be baked in the guidance if you decide to roll it out more broadly this year.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Todd Vasos (Executives)】\nYes, Matt, thanks for letting me answer that one. I could tell you that the labor model that we have currently existing in our stores, we look at it each and every day to make sure that, that, in fact, is the right model. Now what we've seen is that in certain geographic areas, we can spend a little bit more time inside of our stores stocking and ensuring the customer experience is at the highest level that it possibly can. So what we've done is strategically taken a group of stores on a test and tested that theory. It tested out very well. And we are in the process, as we roll through 2015, to roll that test broadly out to a large group of our stores over 2015. Once again, it's very targeted to certain stores, but it is a large group of our stores.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scot Ciccarelli (Analysts)】\nSo during the conference call, I think it was you, Rick, that mentioned you do anticipate changes in the competitive landscape and obviously, Todd just talked about some of the changes on the labor model. Can you provide some color regarding what kind of changes you're expecting? And is this just on the pending -- any pending changes with Family Dollar, now that's going to be in new hands, or are there other elements that you were referencing?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, a fair question, Scot. I think that obviously the #1 thing on our radar screen is the change that is taking place between Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. Once again, the big-box guys are now announcing more initiatives. And what we're trying to do is just stay focused on absolutely everything that's out there. Now while we can only control what we can control, we have -- the beauty of our model is it takes a little bit from a lot of different spots rather than having to grab everything from one spot. So consequently, we stay focused on what absolutely everybody is doing. And yes, I didn't mean to send any unjust or unneeded fear or anything, but we're staying very focused on what everybody is doing. There's a lot of moving parts out there right now.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scot Ciccarelli (Analysts)】\nSo just a general expectation that it's going to be a dynamic competitive environment?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Richard Dreiling (Executives)】\nYes, just the fact that there's a lot of new faces managing new assets, right?\n\n---\n\n【質問: Scot Ciccarelli (Analysts)】\nYes. Okay. Fair enough. And then my follow-up is any -- I guess, David, you talked a little about the EBIT margin opportunity down the road. Can you provide a little bit more color why you're expecting EBIT margins then to be flat to down this year, what -- versus what, frankly, seems to be a bit of an easy comparison following 4 straight years of kind of 10%-plus EBIT margins? Is it some of that's labor investment? Or is it just the continued mix shift on -- impact on the gross margin, et cetera?\n\n---\n\n【回答: David Tehle (Executives)】\nYes, the biggest piece is clearly the labor investment that we're making in our SG&A line, and that really is the bulk of the story there. Again, we expect better performance than we saw in 2013 and 2014 on the gross margin, given some of the product category headwinds we had from tobacco in those years, cycling over that. And then I mentioned we continue to like what we're seeing in shrink, getting some improvement there, and then category management and foreign sourcing helping us. But it's the investment in labor that we're making.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Mary Winn Pilkington (Executives)】\nAll right. I think that will conclude our call today. We have a new member of our IR team in Matt Hancock, and some -- I know some of you had a chance to meet Matt. If you haven't had a chance to meet him, I look forward to introducing to -- you to him. And we'll be around today for calls, so I know we will left some people in the queue, so please feel free to give me a call. Thank you. Operator, that will now conclude our call.",

      "transcript_text1": "Good morning to all the participants in this webcast conference call regarding Inditex results for fiscal 2014. I am Pablo Isla, and here with me today are Ignacio Fernández, our CFO; and Marcos López, Capital Markets Director.\r\nThe results for 2014 show that Inditex continues its global growth. We enjoy a global sales platform that fully integrates stores and online and offers huge growth opportunities. 2014 has been a year of strong expansion for Inditex. We have achieved satisfactory sales growth. The year has been marked by a tight control of operating expenses and significant investments in the expansion of our business. We have finished the year with operations on 5 continents through 8 concepts, 6,683 stores globally and an online presence in the most relevant markets. We start 2015 with a unique platform that can access growth opportunities globally.  \r\nI would like to highlight some key lines on this results. In 2014, Inditex continued expanding its operations in a very significant way. Like-for-like sales grew strongly at 5% on a demanding comparable. Space growth was 10%. Online launches were on track. We are operating an online platform in 27 markets with a wide geographical coverage and rapid growth. \r\nBased on the performance of our business over the year, the Board of Directors is proposing a 7.5% increase in the dividend to be paid in relation to these results. \r\n2014 has been marked by very strong activity on many fronts. I would like to cover a number of initiatives carried out by Inditex. Over fiscal 2014, we have reinforced significantly the differentiation of our key global flagships with very visible store openings. As an example, Zara, at 592 East Nanjing Road occupies 3,000 square meters of retail space in this unique location, and is one of our most emblematic stores worldwide. \r\nThe opening of global flagships is set to continue over fiscal 2015 with highly prominent stores. As an example we have recently reopened Zara's store at 500 5th Avenue, New York, which has doubled it's retail space to 4,000 square meters. In April, we are opening a global flagship for Zara at 61 Oxford St. in London of 4,500 square meters. The program will continue over the year with the opening of a global flagship of more than 4,000 square meters for Zara at SoHo in New York. \r\nWe are in a unique position as we enjoy a global sales platform that fully integrates stores and online as the best way to respond to the demands of our customers. This is a result of our highly differentiated business model with a central inventory position, distribution to all our stores globally at least twice a week and orders received by our customers between 2 and 48 hours. This factor works perfectly in conjunction with our global online sales presence. We believe that Inditex is in an excellent position to take advantage of global growth opportunities where we have a strong potential to continue expanding profitably in the coming years. \r\nLet me now hand over to Ignacio who will present some of the key aspects of our financial performance, and I will join you later for the outlook section.\n\n---\n\nThank you. In fiscal 2014, Inditex achieved net sales of EUR 18.1 billion, EBITDA of EUR 4.1 billion, a net income of EUR 2.5 billion. Inditex has had strong operating performance. As you can see from our financial release, currency translation due to the strong euro versus several currencies has been a feature of the period.  \r\nStarting with sales, I would like to tell you that in the test performance in the period has been satisfactory with sales growth of 8.3%. Taking down the different components of sales, like-for-like sales grew strongly at 5%. Space contribution was 7%. Change in perimeter reduced reported sales by 1%. The translation of sales in currencies different to the euro diverted  [indiscernible] percentage point from the reported figure. \r\nOver 2014 Inditex retail space grew 10% to 3.8 million square meters. We have seen a strong expansion of our selling area in prime locations. We have added 344,000 square meters of space to our retail base over the year. The ongoing expansion of our group has led to global sales platform with a presence in 88 markets on 5 continents, both in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. \r\nRegarding the gross margin, we can say that we are satisfied with evolution in 2014. Gross profit has increased 7% to EUR 10.6 billion resulting a 58.3% gross margin on sales. We have sustained our commercial policies over the period. The change in the accounting method for Tempe from proportional consolidation to the equity method according to the new IFRS rule highlighted earlier this year, have reduced Inditex gross margin by 40 basis points in 2014. This is a presentational issue with no impact on net income.\r\nOperating expenses are totally under control. We have grown 7.7% supporting the strong like-for-like [indiscernible] performance and the significant addition of new retail space. This line includes all the start-up costs for new space and the rollout of online sales. Operating working capital remains negative as a result of the business model. The working capital evolution is in line with the performance of the business. \r\nIn 2014, funds from operations reached EUR 3.4 billion, 14% higher. Ordinary capital expenditure was EUR 1.4 billion. Dividends paid last year were EUR 1.5 billion, 10% higher. Inditex continues to show a strong financial position. Net cash and short-term financial investments were EUR 4 billion.\r\nI will now hand it over to Marcos who will elaborate on the performance of Inditex concepts.\n\n---\n\nIn terms of space addition and online launches, we are on track. Continuing with our global expansion, we have opened stores in 54 markets over the period. Global online launches have continued at a very rapid pace. Regarding the performance by concept in 2014, Zara continues to represent approximately 2/3 of group sales, the younger concepts around 1/3. \r\nI would like to highlight the strong operating performance of the group over 2014. Let me point out that in this period all Inditex's concepts have achieved positive like-for-like sales growth and EBIT margins on sales of 50% or higher. The younger concepts, grouped together, have also performed very well. I would like to highlight that Oysho, Zara Home, Massimo Dutti and Stradivarius have performed very strongly. And finally, I would like to mention that Uterqüe has achieved very strong like-for-like sales growth in the period. \r\nI will now hand over to Pablo for the outlook section.\n\n---\n\nThank you, Marcos. In the coming years, we will continue to invest in the expansion of our business across a number of markets, all of which offer attractive long-term returns through our sales platform that fully integrates stores and online. Inditex is present on 5 continents and in all the key markets, demonstrating the group's global reach. We manage a diversified sales platform in 88 markets. The current base offers huge growth potential for the coming years. \r\nIn Europe, we continue to see huge growth opportunities in both Western and Eastern Europe. It is an area of growth for all our formats and we have an online sales presence in 21 markets. We see great potential to continue expanding profitably in Europe. \r\nIn Asia, our priority is to leverage the strong presence we have established over recent years. Asia accounts today for 20% of Inditex sales. Our expansion has been remarkable due to the excellent reception of our business proposition focused on the latest fashions and the fact that many of the markets are experiencing transformation. We currently enjoy a very strong position in all the key markets of the region. We are following a multi-concept expansion strategy in Asia and we have an online presence in China, Japan and South Korea. \r\nWe see a strong long-term potential for Inditex in Asian markets. We expect very important growth in China through the combination of our 500 strong store network and online sales. We also see strong growth opportunities in the Americas with a number of attractive growth markets. We are following a multi-concept and an online sales strategy in the Americas. We now have an online presence in the United States, Canada and Mexico. We see strong growth ahead of us in the United States. We are growing through a strong combination of very prominent flagship stores and online.\r\nAs we have mentioned to you, we will be opening our global flagship for Zara in SoHo, New York over the year. Other key cities will see important openings in 2015, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, Las Vegas, Houston, Dallas, Boston, New Jersey and Seattle. These openings will be combined with the strong growth we are experiencing in our online sales in the U.S.\r\nWe have continued expanding Zara in Australia and South Africa over 2014, confirming the global reach of our business model. Zara Home is now present in Australia. We will continue to add very significant new stores in both markets over the current year.\r\nInditex online operations have seen a very rapid growth in recent years. Our business model allows a swift expansion of our online sales globally. Zara has built an online sales presence in 21 European markets, the United States, China, the Russian Federation, Japan, South Korea, Mexico and Canada, the world's main economies. The concepts also have an established online sales presence in Europe. Additionally, some of the concepts are present in the United States. We will continue to rollout online sales progressively in all the markets in which we are present with stores. A step in this direction will be the launch of online sales in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau in the autumn-winter season.\r\n2015 will be another year of strong expansion for Inditex. We expect space growth in line with our long-term targets. We plan to open 420 to 480 stores and to absorb 80 to 100 small units into neighboring stores. In recent years, we have seen very intense investment in logistics, central departments and the acquisition of some unique premises. For the coming years, we continue to see strong growth opportunities with capital expenditure growing below space growth. We now see a normalized level of investment with capital expenditure for 2015 around EUR 1.35 billion.\r\nRegarding shareholder remuneration, the Board of Directors will propose at the General Shareholders Meeting a 7.5% increase in the dividend for fiscal 2014 to EUR 0.52 per share. This means the dividend per share has more than doubled since 2009. The total dividend payment will come to EUR 1.6 billion.\r\nFinally, let me tell you that the store and online sales in local currencies have increased 13% from the first of February to the 14th of March 2015. As you all know, the spring-summer season is influenced by the performance over the Easter period due to its significant sales volumes.\r\nAnd this is all from us. Now we will be pleased to answer any questions you may have.",
      "transcript_text2": "【プレゼン: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nGood morning to all the participants in this webcast conference call regarding Inditex results for fiscal 2014. I am Pablo Isla, and here with me today are Ignacio Fernández, our CFO; and Marcos López, Capital Markets Director.\r\nThe results for 2014 show that Inditex continues its global growth. We enjoy a global sales platform that fully integrates stores and online and offers huge growth opportunities. 2014 has been a year of strong expansion for Inditex. We have achieved satisfactory sales growth. The year has been marked by a tight control of operating expenses and significant investments in the expansion of our business. We have finished the year with operations on 5 continents through 8 concepts, 6,683 stores globally and an online presence in the most relevant markets. We start 2015 with a unique platform that can access growth opportunities globally.  \r\nI would like to highlight some key lines on this results. In 2014, Inditex continued expanding its operations in a very significant way. Like-for-like sales grew strongly at 5% on a demanding comparable. Space growth was 10%. Online launches were on track. We are operating an online platform in 27 markets with a wide geographical coverage and rapid growth. \r\nBased on the performance of our business over the year, the Board of Directors is proposing a 7.5% increase in the dividend to be paid in relation to these results. \r\n2014 has been marked by very strong activity on many fronts. I would like to cover a number of initiatives carried out by Inditex. Over fiscal 2014, we have reinforced significantly the differentiation of our key global flagships with very visible store openings. As an example, Zara, at 592 East Nanjing Road occupies 3,000 square meters of retail space in this unique location, and is one of our most emblematic stores worldwide. \r\nThe opening of global flagships is set to continue over fiscal 2015 with highly prominent stores. As an example we have recently reopened Zara's store at 500 5th Avenue, New York, which has doubled it's retail space to 4,000 square meters. In April, we are opening a global flagship for Zara at 61 Oxford St. in London of 4,500 square meters. The program will continue over the year with the opening of a global flagship of more than 4,000 square meters for Zara at SoHo in New York. \r\nWe are in a unique position as we enjoy a global sales platform that fully integrates stores and online as the best way to respond to the demands of our customers. This is a result of our highly differentiated business model with a central inventory position, distribution to all our stores globally at least twice a week and orders received by our customers between 2 and 48 hours. This factor works perfectly in conjunction with our global online sales presence. We believe that Inditex is in an excellent position to take advantage of global growth opportunities where we have a strong potential to continue expanding profitably in the coming years. \r\nLet me now hand over to Ignacio who will present some of the key aspects of our financial performance, and I will join you later for the outlook section.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Ignacio Izuzquiza Fernández (Executives)】\nThank you. In fiscal 2014, Inditex achieved net sales of EUR 18.1 billion, EBITDA of EUR 4.1 billion, a net income of EUR 2.5 billion. Inditex has had strong operating performance. As you can see from our financial release, currency translation due to the strong euro versus several currencies has been a feature of the period.  \r\nStarting with sales, I would like to tell you that in the test performance in the period has been satisfactory with sales growth of 8.3%. Taking down the different components of sales, like-for-like sales grew strongly at 5%. Space contribution was 7%. Change in perimeter reduced reported sales by 1%. The translation of sales in currencies different to the euro diverted  [indiscernible] percentage point from the reported figure. \r\nOver 2014 Inditex retail space grew 10% to 3.8 million square meters. We have seen a strong expansion of our selling area in prime locations. We have added 344,000 square meters of space to our retail base over the year. The ongoing expansion of our group has led to global sales platform with a presence in 88 markets on 5 continents, both in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. \r\nRegarding the gross margin, we can say that we are satisfied with evolution in 2014. Gross profit has increased 7% to EUR 10.6 billion resulting a 58.3% gross margin on sales. We have sustained our commercial policies over the period. The change in the accounting method for Tempe from proportional consolidation to the equity method according to the new IFRS rule highlighted earlier this year, have reduced Inditex gross margin by 40 basis points in 2014. This is a presentational issue with no impact on net income.\r\nOperating expenses are totally under control. We have grown 7.7% supporting the strong like-for-like [indiscernible] performance and the significant addition of new retail space. This line includes all the start-up costs for new space and the rollout of online sales. Operating working capital remains negative as a result of the business model. The working capital evolution is in line with the performance of the business. \r\nIn 2014, funds from operations reached EUR 3.4 billion, 14% higher. Ordinary capital expenditure was EUR 1.4 billion. Dividends paid last year were EUR 1.5 billion, 10% higher. Inditex continues to show a strong financial position. Net cash and short-term financial investments were EUR 4 billion.\r\nI will now hand it over to Marcos who will elaborate on the performance of Inditex concepts.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Marcos García (Executives)】\nIn terms of space addition and online launches, we are on track. Continuing with our global expansion, we have opened stores in 54 markets over the period. Global online launches have continued at a very rapid pace. Regarding the performance by concept in 2014, Zara continues to represent approximately 2/3 of group sales, the younger concepts around 1/3. \r\nI would like to highlight the strong operating performance of the group over 2014. Let me point out that in this period all Inditex's concepts have achieved positive like-for-like sales growth and EBIT margins on sales of 50% or higher. The younger concepts, grouped together, have also performed very well. I would like to highlight that Oysho, Zara Home, Massimo Dutti and Stradivarius have performed very strongly. And finally, I would like to mention that Uterqüe has achieved very strong like-for-like sales growth in the period. \r\nI will now hand over to Pablo for the outlook section.\n\n---\n\n【プレゼン: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nThank you, Marcos. In the coming years, we will continue to invest in the expansion of our business across a number of markets, all of which offer attractive long-term returns through our sales platform that fully integrates stores and online. Inditex is present on 5 continents and in all the key markets, demonstrating the group's global reach. We manage a diversified sales platform in 88 markets. The current base offers huge growth potential for the coming years. \r\nIn Europe, we continue to see huge growth opportunities in both Western and Eastern Europe. It is an area of growth for all our formats and we have an online sales presence in 21 markets. We see great potential to continue expanding profitably in Europe. \r\nIn Asia, our priority is to leverage the strong presence we have established over recent years. Asia accounts today for 20% of Inditex sales. Our expansion has been remarkable due to the excellent reception of our business proposition focused on the latest fashions and the fact that many of the markets are experiencing transformation. We currently enjoy a very strong position in all the key markets of the region. We are following a multi-concept expansion strategy in Asia and we have an online presence in China, Japan and South Korea. \r\nWe see a strong long-term potential for Inditex in Asian markets. We expect very important growth in China through the combination of our 500 strong store network and online sales. We also see strong growth opportunities in the Americas with a number of attractive growth markets. We are following a multi-concept and an online sales strategy in the Americas. We now have an online presence in the United States, Canada and Mexico. We see strong growth ahead of us in the United States. We are growing through a strong combination of very prominent flagship stores and online.\r\nAs we have mentioned to you, we will be opening our global flagship for Zara in SoHo, New York over the year. Other key cities will see important openings in 2015, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, Las Vegas, Houston, Dallas, Boston, New Jersey and Seattle. These openings will be combined with the strong growth we are experiencing in our online sales in the U.S.\r\nWe have continued expanding Zara in Australia and South Africa over 2014, confirming the global reach of our business model. Zara Home is now present in Australia. We will continue to add very significant new stores in both markets over the current year.\r\nInditex online operations have seen a very rapid growth in recent years. Our business model allows a swift expansion of our online sales globally. Zara has built an online sales presence in 21 European markets, the United States, China, the Russian Federation, Japan, South Korea, Mexico and Canada, the world's main economies.

We will continue to rollout online sales progressively in all the markets in which we are present with stores.

We expect space growth in line with our long-term targets. We plan to open 420 to 480 stores and to absorb 80 to 100 small units into neighboring stores. In recent years, we have seen very intense investment in logistics, central departments and the acquisition of some unique premises.

Now we will be pleased to answer any questions you may have.",
      "transcript_text3": "My question is about rents. I mean, following fairly good macro recovery in many markets, are you seeing rental inflation now accelerate? And is that something we need to take account of in the operating cost line to the year ahead? And on the side, are you paying your rents in Russia in dollars, please?\n\n---\n\nWell, regarding your question, I will tell you that we are not seeing any different environment that could have been the case during the last year. So you should not expect, for this year, rental expenses to go above the space growth. And having -- and regarding the second part of your question, what we can tell you is that most of our rental agreements in Russia are in local currencies, as it is the case in any other country.\n\n---\n\nI've got 2 quick questions. Firstly, again, actually on Russia, do you expect to continue to expand in Russia at the same pace as the last few years? It was the country with the biggest number of stores opened last year, is that going to continue? And secondly, on infrastructure, how many more years of capacity do you think you have with the current level of infrastructure that you have?\n\n---\n\nWell, regarding Russia, what I can tell you is that, in our business in Russia continues developing, I would say, in a very normal and positive way in local currencies. As always, when we talk about any particular market where we always have in mind the medium and the long term, not only the short term, so the idea, of course, is to continue developing our business in Russia. In terms of the number of openings in one particular year, you must have in mind that in Russia, most of the expansion has to do with shopping malls. And when we decide to go to a shopping mall, typically, we go with 7 or 8 brands. So you could have from one year to another, 30 or 40 stores of difference, but finally 3, 4 different shopping malls. But globally, as from a strategic point of view, we will continue developing our business in Russia. That, as I was saying to you just before, is a business which is having a very, I would say, healthy evolution. And regarding infrastructure, what we can say is that we are not expecting, at least in the next 3 years, big investments that have to do with infrastructure. We have gone through a very significant period in terms of investments, both in our central headquarters, the facilities and then of course, logistics. And now we have enough -- of course, every year, there are investments in logistics because you are permanently investing. But we are not expecting, at least in the next 3 years, any huge logistic investment.\n\n---\n\nIt's Rebecca with Santander. A couple of questions, please. Firstly, in terms of your CapEx guidance, obviously, you're guiding to CapEx growth below sales growth. Do you think that would be similar to the dynamics next year and the year after until we get through to the next investment period?\n\n---\n\nYes. Yes. We think this will continue being the case. We anticipated this to you more or less have -- 6 months ago, that what we were seeing for the near future was a CapEx growth to go below space growth. This is going to be the case in the year 2015 and this will continue being the case in the year 2016.\n\n---\n\nAnd then my question is on the recent like-for-like momentum. Is that totally volume or is there any pricing -- is there any ASP inflation in that like-for-like trend?\n\n---\n\nNo. Our like-for-like is volume driven, as it has always been the case. We have, in the year 2014, we have had very positive like-for-like, 5%. We have had positive like-for-like in all the geographies, in all the different concepts. So -- and like-for-like is volume driven as it is always the case.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And sorry, just one final one. Can you give some guidance on the 2015 gross margin given what's been going on with the U.S. dollar?\n\n---\n\nWell, what we can say, of course, we are just at the very beginning of the year. And what we can say at current exchange rates, our forecast would be a stable gross margin. But as we always say, stable means plus or minus 50 basis points and we are just at the beginning of the year. But at this stage, we would say a stable gross margin for the year 2015.\n\n---\n\nOkay. With the lead time of about 3 months on your sourcing, is that right?\n\n---\n\nWell, I think this is something -- it has to do with -- when we talk about the gross margin, we always say that it has to do with many different elements. And what I would say is what I was saying before, that at current exchange rate and at the beginning of the year, at this stage, we would be seeing a stable gross margin for the full year.\n\n---\n\nA follow-up question on the gross margin guidance. I think that the impact from the U.S. dollar is quite limited nowadays. And looking back, the FX was negative over the last 2 years and impacted sales by around 5% negatively. If we assume that the FX now could impact positively sales going forward, don't you think that eventually should also be positive for gross margin? And eventually, the gross margin could expand more than the flat or more than your guidance of flat margin that you just presented? That's my question. And also, related to FX, what could be the FX -- the impact on FX on full year '15?\n\n---\n\nOkay. Regarding the gross margin, José, as you know the gross margin is composed of many factors, currency is one of them. And I think that at this stage, what we have said is that at current exchange rates the gross margin expectation is for a stable gross margin. This is very much our policy taking into account all the different elements.\n\n---\n\nAnd about the FX for the year, we would say the same, I mean, we are just at the beginning of the year. At current exchange rates, we will see a slightly positive impact on sales coming from ForEx, but we are just at the beginning of the year.\n\n---\n\nOkay. But slightly impact will be positive, right?\n\n---\n\nYes. At current exchange rates, yes. But as we were saying to you, we are just at the beginning of the year.\n\n---\n\nI was just wondering, if you could talk a little bit about Spain, given it's your biggest geography. Can you give us a sense of what your like-for-like growth rates are there? And how the Spanish growth impacts, if anything, on you gross margin, is it positive or negative for gross margin?\n\n---\n\nWell, about Spain, what we can say is that our sales in the year have grown 5%, which is quite a relevant figure in Spain. Our space is flat, so we are not increasing and we are not decreasing our space in the Spanish market. So our sales in the year have grown 5%. We began to see a recovery of sales in the second half of the year 2013. And then this year, 2014, has been a very solid year in terms of sales growth. We have been very active in the Spanish market, as you know, with some very relevant openings in Madrid with Zara with Massimo Dutti, in San Sebastian also with Zara and then with all the other brands, so we have been very active. We will continue being very active with refurbishments, with openings. Globally, our space in Spain will remain stable during the year 2015. What I would say is that we are operating our business now in a very normal environment, I would say. So if we have good collections, if we have the right product, we are able to increase our sales, as it has been the case during the year 2014. And about Spain in terms of the gross margin, is very similar to all the other geographies.\n\n---\n\nI just wondered, Pablo, if you could just comment on your approach to pricing globally, particularly given recent currency volatility in markets like Russia and I guess, to lesser extent Japan. Are you planing to raise prices gradually over a number of seasons in those sort of markets?\n\n---\n\nWell, first of all, what I would tell you is that, globally, because then you are talking about very specific markets, but globally, our prices remain stable. And always, in everything which has to do with prices, we always have a medium and long-term approach because when we are in a market we are always planning to be in the market forever. So we always have in mind the medium and the long-term approach. In some cases, when there is a currency volatility and there is significant inflation, we could decide to adjust progressively our prices, never to increase dramatically our prices in one particular season. But for example, if you just talk about Russia, we have increased slightly our prices because of these 2 conditions. But always having in mind the medium and long-term approach and always having in mind that when we are in a market, we want to be in that market for many, many years. So we are not particularly upset with translating any type of currency movement to prices at any -- in any particular season. So globally, a stable pricing policy. In some cases, in some markets, there could be slight price increases, but having always in mind, the medium and the long-term approach.\n\n---\n\nOkay. So I can totally understand price increases in Russia. But are there any markets where we're actually getting price reductions over the course of this season?\n\n---\n\nI prefer not to enter into the specifics of any particular market, if it's -- it's a global stable pricing policy.\n\n---\n\nI was wondering if you could speak a little bit about the U.S. given that the rollout in 2015 seems to be an acceleration from what you've done over the last few years. And is that, that you've seen more information about demand given your e-commerce business or you think conditions are changing there that may get a more attractive market for entry now versus a few years ago?\n\n---\n\nAs you were mentioning the USA is a market in which we are feeling more and more comfortable about expanding our business. 2014 has been quite relevant from that point of view and 2015 will be even more relevant with a significant number of openings and particularly with some very relevant openings or reopenings, because we were mentioning during the presentation this refurbishment and enlargement on Fifth Avenue with 42nd Street, which is an incredible -- it was a very good store and now after the enlargement and refurbishment is becoming an incredible store. Or our new store in the SoHo in the final part of the year or in the World Trade Center, or openings that we are having in many different cities. As I was saying to you, we see clearly that the U.S. is a growth market for us. We have this combination between store openings and online. Online, of course, is giving us access to all the customers in all the different cities in the country. And we clearly see for the year 2015 and for the coming years, the U.S. as a significant market for us in terms of expansion, in terms of growth, with this fully integrated approach between online and stores that we think is a very good strategy to -- for the U.S. market as for any other market. Because for us what is very relevant is this concept of being fully integrated retailers. Retailer, online and stores are completely integrated from every point of view. You can order online from the stores. You can order online and have the delivery in the store. The return of our customer is fully integrated in his mindset. So we, as a retailer, we are also fully integrated and we think that this approach is very strong in any particular market, but talking specifically about the U.S., of course, this is the case. So this -- in the year 2014, we had significant openings in the U.S. In the year 2015, it will be much more relevant and this will continue being the case in the coming years.\n\n---\n\nI just wanted to come back to your comments on currency. I think you said there will be a small modest, positive impact to sales at current exchange rates and also, you anticipate a stable gross margin. Could you just clarify, do you mean current exchange rates as in spot this morning or the exchange rates when you did your budgeting about 4 to 6 weeks ago, presumably?\n\n---\n\nWe don't want to be that specific, Fraser. I think that we did at the start of the year, and I think that the guidance we are providing is reasonable, a small positive impact on sales at the current exchange rates. And obviously, the gross margin is not just currency, you have on this mix is a -- there are many, many factors. So all things considered, and at current exchange rates, what we can say now is a broadly stable gross margin for the year.\n\n---\n\nAnd just to clarify on pricing, because this obviously relates to the same question on gross margin. I think in recent years, some of the premium markets like Japan, like China, those premier have come down. Where do you see the sort of differential to the eurozone currently for markets such as the U.S. and China?\n\n---\n\nWell, as we have mentioned during the call, our pricing strategy tends to be very global. If you take our base prices, which are Europe x Spain, I would tell you that the differentials are not very material. Obviously, you mentioned in markets which have experienced a significant currency depreciation like Japan. But in general, I would say that the differentials are relatively limited. So we continue to foresee a stable global pricing policy.\n\n---\n\nJust a quick question on working capital. I was just looking at the balance sheet and you've set out, I think in your release, that negative working capital position looks stable year-on-year. But in the cash flow, you've got an outflow of about EUR 101 million. I'm just wondering, what explains the difference between those figures?\n\n---\n\nWell, in -- I suppose you are referring to the funds from operations, and this refers mostly to the calendar of payments. In many cases, sometimes it just the tax.\n\n---\n\nGood morning. The first question from the webcast platform is regarding China. Can you comment on your expectations for China over 2015 and the coming years?\n\n---\n\nWell, as we were saying during the presentation, at the end of last year, we were operating 500 stores in China. We have a strong presence through our stores with all the different brands. We have a strong online presence. We also began, last year, our operations through Tmall, not only for our own web page, but also through Tmall. In the year 2015, we are planning also to open a significant number of stores to continue developing our business always. Our store opening plan, as in any other market, is a combination between high street locations and shopping mall. We were mentioning in the presentation this very relevant opening in Shanghai, or the relevant opening we had done, more or less at the same time, at the end of last year in Nanjing [ph]. We'll continue with this process of opening relevant stores, opening stores in different shopping malls. We see China as a very relevant market for us today, and this will continue being the case in the coming years, because of the size of the market, because of the evolution, because of how customers appreciate fashion. So it's quite a relevant market for us for all our brands.\n\n---\n\nOkay. We've got a number of questions regarding online. Can you give us an update on online? And specifically, are there any metrics that you can talk about, for example, in-store returns and deliveries, et cetera?\n\n---\n\nWell, we as I was saying in a previous question, we are a fully integrated retailer. So for us, online and the stores are totally integrated. You were mentioning this possibility of in-store deliveries, in-store returns. I would say, close to 1/3 of total deliveries are taking place in the stores and close to 2/3 of total returns are taking place in the stores. So this is something quite positive for us, because it's very convenient for our customers. And at the same time, they are coming to our stores. So for us, what is key is this central inventory position, this possibility to develop our online business and this full integration between stores and online.\n\n---\n\nOkay. And the final question from the webcast platform, can you update us on where you are with your RFID project?\n\n---\n\nWell, we are -- we'll continue with the implementation. Now it is implemented in more than 1,000 stores globally at the end of this year. It will be implemented in more than 1,500 Zara stores in the different countries in the world. And this project, as we mentioned to you before, is very relevant in terms of store management, in terms of replenishment, in terms of inventories, in terms of customer service. Finally, because this is what we want to achieve with this project, which is very relevant in the way we operate the stores and which has been very, very positive from every point of view.\n\n---\n\nOkay. We have no further questions from the webcast. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nWell, thank you to all of you for joining us during this conference call. And of course, as always, we will be ready to continue answering your questions by phone or in further meetings.  Thank you very much for joining us today. Thank you.",

But we are not expecting, at least in the next 3 years, any huge logistic investment.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nIt's Rebecca with Santander. A couple of questions, please. Firstly, in terms of your CapEx guidance, obviously, you're guiding to CapEx growth below sales growth. Do you think that would be similar to the dynamics next year and the year after until we get through to the next investment period?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nYes. Yes. We think this will continue being the case. We anticipated this to you more or less have -- 6 months ago, that what we were seeing for the near future was a CapEx growth to go below space growth. This is going to be the case in the year 2015 and this will continue being the case in the year 2016.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nAnd then my question is on the recent like-for-like momentum. Is that totally volume or is there any pricing -- is there any ASP inflation in that like-for-like trend?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nNo. Our like-for-like is volume driven, as it has always been the case. We have, in the year 2014, we have had very positive like-for-like, 5%. We have had positive like-for-like in all the geographies, in all the different concepts. So -- and like-for-like is volume driven as it is always the case.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nOkay. And sorry, just one final one. Can you give some guidance on the 2015 gross margin given what's been going on with the U.S. dollar?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, what we can say, of course, we are just at the very beginning of the year. And what we can say at current exchange rates, our forecast would be a stable gross margin. But as we always say, stable means plus or minus 50 basis points and we are just at the beginning of the year. But at this stage, we would say a stable gross margin for the year 2015.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Rebecca McClellan (Analysts)】\nOkay. With the lead time of about 3 months on your sourcing, is that right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, I think this is something -- it has to do with -- when we talk about the gross margin, we always say that it has to do with many different elements. And what I would say is what I was saying before, that at current exchange rate and at the beginning of the year, at this stage, we would be seeing a stable gross margin for the full year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: José Rito (Analysts)】\nA follow-up question on the gross margin guidance. I think that the impact from the U.S. dollar is quite limited nowadays. And looking back, the FX was negative over the last 2 years and impacted sales by around 5% negatively. If we assume that the FX now could impact positively sales going forward, don't you think that eventually should also be positive for gross margin? And eventually, the gross margin could expand more than the flat or more than your guidance of flat margin that you just presented? That's my question. And also, related to FX, what could be the FX -- the impact on FX on full year '15?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Marcos García (Executives)】\nOkay. Regarding the gross margin, José, as you know the gross margin is composed of many factors, currency is one of them. And I think that at this stage, what we have said is that at current exchange rates the gross margin expectation is for a stable gross margin. This is very much our policy taking into account all the different elements.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nAnd about the FX for the year, we would say the same, I mean, we are just at the beginning of the year. At current exchange rates, we will see a slightly positive impact on sales coming from ForEx, but we are just at the beginning of the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: José Rito (Analysts)】\nOkay. But slightly impact will be positive, right?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Marcos García (Executives)】\nYes. At current exchange rates, yes. But as we were saying to you, we are just at the beginning of the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Paul Steegers (Analysts)】\nI was just wondering, if you could talk a little bit about Spain, given it's your biggest geography. Can you give us a sense of what your like-for-like growth rates are there? And how the Spanish growth impacts, if anything, on you gross margin, is it positive or negative for gross margin?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, about Spain, what we can say is that our sales in the year have grown 5%, which is quite a relevant figure in Spain. Our space is flat, so we are not increasing and we are not decreasing our space in the Spanish market. So our sales in the year have grown 5%. We began to see a recovery of sales in the second half of the year 2013. And then this year, 2014, has been a very solid year in terms of sales growth. We have been very active in the Spanish market, as you know, with some very relevant openings in Madrid with Zara with Massimo Dutti, in San Sebastian also with Zara and then with all the other brands, so we have been very active. We will continue being very active with refurbishments, with openings. Globally, our space in Spain will remain stable during the year 2015. What I would say is that we are operating our business now in a very normal environment, I would say. So if we have good collections, if we have the right product, we are able to increase our sales, as it has been the case during the year 2014. And about Spain in terms of the gross margin, is very similar to all the other geographies.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Chamberlain (Analysts)】\nI just wondered, Pablo, if you could just comment on your approach to pricing globally, particularly given recent currency volatility in markets like Russia and I guess, to lesser extent Japan. Are you planing to raise prices gradually over a number of seasons in those sort of markets?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, first of all, what I would tell you is that, globally, because then you are talking about very specific markets, but globally, our prices remain stable. And always, in everything which has to do with prices, we always have a medium and long-term approach because when we are in a market we are always planning to be in the market forever. So we always have in mind the medium and the long-term approach. In some cases, when there is a currency volatility and there is significant inflation, we could decide to adjust progressively our prices, never to increase dramatically our prices in one particular season. But for example, if you just talk about Russia, we have increased slightly our prices because of these 2 conditions. But always having in mind the medium and long-term approach and always having in mind that when we are in a market, we want to be in that market for many, many years. So we are not particularly upset with translating any type of currency movement to prices at any -- in any particular season. So globally, a stable pricing policy. In some cases, in some markets, there could be slight price increases, but having always in mind, the medium and the long-term approach.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Chamberlain (Analysts)】\nOkay. So I can totally understand price increases in Russia. But are there any markets where we're actually getting price reductions over the course of this season?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nI prefer not to enter into the specifics of any particular market, if it's -- it's a global stable pricing policy.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Jamie Merriman (Analysts)】\nI was wondering if you could speak a little bit about the U.S. given that the rollout in 2015 seems to be an acceleration from what you've done over the last few years. And is that, that you've seen more information about demand given your e-commerce business or you think conditions are changing there that may get a more attractive market for entry now versus a few years ago?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nAs you were mentioning the USA is a market in which we are feeling more and more comfortable about expanding our business. 2014 has been quite relevant from that point of view and 2015 will be even more relevant with a significant number of openings and particularly with some very relevant openings or reopenings, because we were mentioning during the presentation this refurbishment and enlargement on Fifth Avenue with 42nd Street, which is an incredible -- it was a very good store and now after the enlargement and refurbishment is becoming an incredible store. Or our new store in the SoHo in the final part of the year or in the World Trade Center, or openings that we are having in many different cities. As I was saying to you, we see clearly that the U.S. is a growth market for us. We have this combination between store openings and online. Online, of course, is giving us access to all the customers in all the different cities in the country. And we clearly see for the year 2015 and for the coming years, the U.S. as a significant market for us in terms of expansion, in terms of growth, with this fully integrated approach between online and stores that we think is a very good strategy to -- for the U.S. market as for any other market. Because for us what is very relevant is this concept of being fully integrated retailers. Retailer, online and stores are completely integrated from every point of view. You can order online from the stores. You can order online and have the delivery in the store. The return of our customer is fully integrated in his mindset. So we, as a retailer, we are also fully integrated and we think that this approach is very strong in any particular market, but talking specifically about the U.S., of course, this is the case. So this -- in the year 2014, we had significant openings in the U.S. In the year 2015, it will be much more relevant and this will continue being the case in the coming years.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nI just wanted to come back to your comments on currency. I think you said there will be a small modest, positive impact to sales at current exchange rates and also, you anticipate a stable gross margin. Could you just clarify, do you mean current exchange rates as in spot this morning or the exchange rates when you did your budgeting about 4 to 6 weeks ago, presumably?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWe don't want to be that specific, Fraser. I think that we did at the start of the year, and I think that the guidance we are providing is reasonable, a small positive impact on sales at the current exchange rates. And obviously, the gross margin is not just currency, you have on this mix is a -- there are many, many factors. So all things considered, and at current exchange rates, what we can say now is a broadly stable gross margin for the year.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Fraser Ramzan (Analysts)】\nAnd just to clarify on pricing, because this obviously relates to the same question on gross margin. I think in recent years, some of the premium markets like Japan, like China, those premier have come down. Where do you see the sort of differential to the eurozone currently for markets such as the U.S. and China?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, as we have mentioned during the call, our pricing strategy tends to be very global. If you take our base prices, which are Europe x Spain, I would tell you that the differentials are not very material. Obviously, you mentioned in markets which have experienced a significant currency depreciation like Japan. But in general, I would say that the differentials are relatively limited. So we continue to foresee a stable global pricing policy.\n\n---\n\n【質問: Richard Edwards (Analysts)】\nJust a quick question on working capital. I was just looking at the balance sheet and you've set out, I think in your release, that negative working capital position looks stable year-on-year. But in the cash flow, you've got an outflow of about EUR 101 million. I'm just wondering, what explains the difference between those figures?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, in -- I suppose you are referring to the funds from operations, and this refers mostly to the calendar of payments. In many cases, sometimes it just the tax.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nGood morning. The first question from the webcast platform is regarding China. Can you comment on your expectations for China over 2015 and the coming years?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, as we were saying during the presentation, at the end of last year, we were operating 500 stores in China. We have a strong presence through our stores with all the different brands. We have a strong online presence. We also began, last year, our operations through Tmall, not only for our own web page, but also through Tmall. In the year 2015, we are planning also to open a significant number of stores to continue developing our business always. Our store opening plan, as in any other market, is a combination between high street locations and shopping mall. We were mentioning in the presentation this very relevant opening in Shanghai, or the relevant opening we had done, more or less at the same time, at the end of last year in Nanjing [ph]. We'll continue with this process of opening relevant stores, opening stores in different shopping malls. We see China as a very relevant market for us today, and this will continue being the case in the coming years, because of the size of the market, because of the evolution, because of how customers appreciate fashion. So it's quite a relevant market for us for all our brands.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nOkay. We've got a number of questions regarding online. Can you give us an update on online? And specifically, are there any metrics that you can talk about, for example, in-store returns and deliveries, et cetera?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, we as I was saying in a previous question, we are a fully integrated retailer. So for us, online and the stores are totally integrated. You were mentioning this possibility of in-store deliveries, in-store returns. I would say, close to 1/3 of total deliveries are taking place in the stores and close to 2/3 of total returns are taking place in the stores. So this is something quite positive for us, because it's very convenient for our customers. And at the same time, they are coming to our stores. So for us, what is key is this central inventory position, this possibility to develop our online business and this full integration between stores and online.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nOkay. And the final question from the webcast platform, can you update us on where you are with your RFID project?\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, we are -- we'll continue with the implementation. Now it is implemented in more than 1,000 stores globally at the end of this year. It will be implemented in more than 1,500 Zara stores in the different countries in the world. And this project, as we mentioned to you before, is very relevant in terms of store management, in terms of replenishment, in terms of inventories, in terms of customer service. Finally, because this is what we want to achieve with this project, which is very relevant in the way we operate the stores and which has been very, very positive from every point of view.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Unknown Executive (Executives)】\nOkay. We have no further questions from the webcast. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n【回答: Pablo De Tejera (Executives)】\nWell, thank you to all of you for joining us during this conference call. And of course, as always, we will be ready to continue answering your questions by phone or in further meetings.  Thank you very much for joining us today. Thank you.",
